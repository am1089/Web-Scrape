Therefore let him approach\na woman whose garments are pure, and whose fame is pure, and address her.\n\n7\\. If she do not give in 2, let him, as he likes, bribe her (with presents).\nAnd if she then do not give in, let him, as he likes, beat her with a stick or\nwith his hand, and overcome her 3, saying: 'With manly strength and glory I\ntake away thy glory,'--and thus she becomes unglorious 4.\n\n8\\. If she give in, he says: 'With manly strength and glory I give thee\nglory,'--and thus they both become glorious.\n\n9\\.

Now again, if a man's wife has a lover and the husband hates him, let him\n(according to rule) 1 place fire by an unbaked jar, spread a layer of arrows\nin inverse order 2, anoint these three arrow-heads 3 with butter in inverse\norder, and sacrifice, saying: 'Thou hast sacrificed in my fire, I take away\nthy up and down breathing, I here 4.'\n\n'Thou hast sacrificed in my fire, I take away thy sons and cattle, I here.'\n\n'Thou hast sacrificed in my fire, I take away thy sacred and thy good works, I\nhere.'\n\n'Thou hast sacrificed in my fire, I take away thy hope and expectation, I\nhere.'\n\nHe whom a Brahma _n_ a who knows this curses, departs from this world without\nstrength and without good works. Therefore let no one wish even for sport with\nthe wife of a _S_ rotriya 5 who knows this, for he who knows this, is a\ndangerous enemy.\n\n13\\. When the monthly illness seizes his wife, she\n\np. 219\n\nshould for three days not drink from a metal vessel, and wear a fresh dress.\nLet no V _ri_ shala or V _ri_ shali (a _S_ udra man or woman) touch her. At\nthe end of the three days, when she has bathed, the husband should make her\npound rice 1.\n\n14\\. And if a man wishes that a white son should be born to him, and that he\nshould know one Veda, and live to his full age, then, after having prepared\nboiled rice with milk and butter, they should both eat, being fit to have\noffspring.\n\n15\\. And if a man wishes that a reddish 2 son with tawny eyes should be born\nto him, and that he should know two Vedas, and live to his full age, then,\nafter having prepared boiled rice with coagulated milk and butter, they should\nboth eat, being fit to have offspring.\n\n16\\. And if a man wishes that a dark son should be born to him with red eyes,\nand that he should know three Vedas, and live to his full age, then, after\nhaving prepared boiled rice with water and butter, they should both eat, being\nfit to have offspring.\n\n17\\. And if a man wishes that a learned daughter should be born to him, and\nthat she should live to her full age, then, after having prepared boiled rice\nwith sesamum and butter, they should both eat, being fit to have offspring.\n\n18\\. And if a man wishes that a learned son should be born to him, famous, a\npublic man, a popular speaker, that he should know all the Vedas, and that\n\np. 220\n\nhe should live to his full age, then, after having prepared boiled rice with\nmeat and butter, they should both eat, being fit to have offspring. The meat\nshould be of a young or of an old bull.\n\n19\\. And then toward morning, after having, according to the rule of the\nSthalipaka (pot-boiling), performed the preparation of the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya (clarified\nbutter 1), he sacrifices from the Sthalipaka bit by bit, saying: 'This is for\nAgni, Svaha! This is for Anumati, Svaha! This is for the divine Savit _ri_ ,\nthe true creator, Svaha!' Having sacrificed, he takes out the rest of the rice\nand eats it, and after having eaten, he gives it to his wife. Then he washes\nhis hands, fills a water-jar, and sprinkles her thrice with it, saying: 'Rise\nhence, O Vi _s_ vavasu 2, seek another blooming girl, a wife with her\nhusband.'\n\n20\\. Then he embraces her, and says: 'I am Ama (breath), thou art Sa (speech)\n3. Thou art Sa (speech), I am Ama (breath). I am the Saman, thou art the _Ri_\n_k_  4. I am the sky, thou art the earth. Come, let us strive together, that a\nmale child may be begotten 5.'\n\np. 221\n\n21\\.

When the child is born, he prepares the fire, places the child on his\nlap, and having poured p _ri_ shada _g_ ya, i.e. dadhi (thick milk) mixed with\ngh _ri_ ta (clarified butter) into a metal jug, he sacrifices bit by bit of\nthat p _ri_ shada _g_ ya, saying: 'May I, as I increase in this my house,\nnourish a thousand! May fortune never fail in his race, with offspring and\ncattle, Svaha!'\n\n'I offer to thee. in my mind the vital breaths which are in me, Svaha!'\n\n'Whatever 2 in my work I have done too much, or whatever I have here done too\nlittle, may the wise Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t make this right and proper for\nus, Svaha!'\n\n25\\. Then putting his mouth near the child's right ear, he says thrice,\nSpeech, speech 3! After\n\np. 223\n\nthat he pours together thick milk, honey, and clarified butter, and feeds the\nchild with (a ladle of) pure gold 1, saying: 'I give thee Bhu _h_ , I give\nthee Bhuva _h_ , I give thee Sva _h_  2. Bhur, Bhuva _h_ , Sva _h_ , I give\nthee all 3.'\n\n26 4. Then he gives him his name, saying: 'Thou art Veda;' but this is his\nsecret name 5.\n\n27\\. Then he hands the boy to his mother and gives him her breast, saying: 'O\nSarasvati, that breast of thine which is inexhaustible, delightful, abundant,\nwealthy, generous, by which thou cherishest all blessings, make that to flow\nhere 6.'\n\n28 7. Then he addresses the mother of the boy:\n\np. 224a\n\n'Thou art I _l_ a Maitravaru _n_ i: thou strong woman hast born a strong boy.\nBe thou blessed with strong children thou who hast blessed me with a strong\nchild.'\n\nAnd they say of such a boy: 'Ah, thou art better than thy father; ah, thou art\nbetter than thy grandfather. Truly he has reached the highest point in\nhappiness, praise, and Vedic glory who is born as the son of a Brahma _n_ a\nthat knows this.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[215:1](sbe15096.htm#fr_622) According to the rules laid down in the proper\nGrihya-sutras.\n\n[215:2](sbe15097.htm#fr_623) This Brahma _n_ a is inserted here because there\nis supposed to be some similarity between the preparation of the _S_ rimantha\nand the Putramantha, or because a person who has performed the _S_ rimantha is\nfit to perform the Putramantha. Thus _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara says: Pra _n_ adar _s_ ina _h_\n_s_ rimantha _m_ karma k _ri_ tavata _h_ putramanthe 'dhikara _h_. Yada\nputramantha _m_ _k_ ikirshati tada srimantha _m_ k _ri_ tva _ri_ tukala _m_\npatnya _h_ (brahma _k_ arye _n_ a) pratikshata iti.\n\n[215:3](sbe15097.htm#fr_624) I have given those portions of the text which did\nnot admit of translation into English, in Sanskrit. It was not easy, however,\nto determine always the text of the Kanva- _s_ akha. Poley's text is not\nalways correct, and Roer seems simply to repeat it. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's commentary,\nwhich is meant for the Kanva text, becomes very short towards the end of the\nUpanishad. It is quite sufficient for the purpose of a translation, but by no\nmeans always for restoring a correct text. MS. Wilson 369, which has been\nassigned to the Ka _n_ va- _s_ akha, and which our Catalogue attributes to the\nsame school, gives the Madhyandina text, and so does MS. Mill 108. I have\ntherefore collated two MSS. of the India Office, which Dr. Rost had the\nkindness to select for me, MS. 375 and MS. 1973, which I call A. and B.\n\n[216:1](sbe15097.htm#fr_625) Roer reads samidho, but _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara and\nDvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga clearly presuppose samiddho, which is in A. and B.\n\n[216:2](sbe15097.htm#fr_626) Roer has asa _m_ sa stri _n_ am, Poley, A. and B.\nhave asa _m_ stri _n_ am. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara. (MS. Mill 64) read a sa stri _n_ am, and\nlater on asya striya _h_ , though both Roer and Poley leave out the a here too\n(a asyeti _kh_ eda _h_ ).\n\n[216:3](sbe15097.htm#fr_627) Brahma _n_ ayana _h_ , the same as brahmabandhava\n_h_ , i.e. Brahmans by descent only, not by knowledge.\n\n[216:4](sbe15097.htm#fr_628) Naraka _m_ ga _k_ _kh_ antityartha _h_.\nDvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga.\n\n[216:5](sbe15097.htm#fr_629) Bahu va svalpa _m_ va.\n\n[216:6](sbe15097.htm#fr_630) The Madhyandina text has agnayo, and Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga\nexplains it by dhish _n_ ya agnaya _h_ _s_ arirasthita _h_. Poley and Roer\nhave punar agnir dhish _n_ ya, and so have A. and B.\n\n[216:7](sbe15097.htm#fr_631) Nirm _ri_ _g_ yat, A.; nim _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ yat, B.\n\n[216:8](sbe15097.htm#fr_632) Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga adds, retoyonav udake reta _h_ si\n_k_ as tatra sva _k_ _kh_ ayadar _s_ ane praya _s_ _k_ ittam aha.\n\n[217:1](sbe15097.htm#fr_633) Triratravrata _m_ k _ri_ tva _k_ aturtha 'hni\nsnatam.\n\n[217:2](sbe15097.htm#fr_634) Instead of connecting kamam with dadyat,\nDvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga explains it by yatha _s_ akti.\n\n[217:3](sbe15097.htm#fr_635) Atikram, scil. maithunaya.\n\n[217:4](sbe15097.htm#fr_636) Bandhya durbhaga.\n\n[217:5](sbe15097.htm#fr_637) Nish _t_ aya, A.

As there are four imprecations, it is\nbut natural that tisra _h_ should be left out in the Ka _n_ va text. It is\nfound in the Madhyandina text, because there the imprecations are only three\nin number, viz. the taking away of hope and expectation, of sons and cattle,\nand of up and down breathing. Instead of asav iti, which is sufficient, the\nMadhyandina text has asav iti nama g _ri_ h _n_ ati, and both \xc3\x82nandagiri and\nDvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga allow the alternative, atmana _h_ _s_ atror va nama grih _n_ ati,\nthough asau can really refer to the speaker only.\n\n[218:5](sbe15097.htm#fr_647) Roer reads dvare _n_ a; Poley, A. and B. dare _n_\na; the Madhyandinas p. 219 _g_ ayaya. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, according to Roer,\ninterprets dvare _n_ a, but it seems that dvare _n_ a is used here in the\nsingular, instead of the plural. See Paraskara G _ri_ hya-sutras I, 11.\n\n[219:1](sbe15097.htm#fr_648) To be used for the ceremony described in \xc2\xa7 14\nseq.\n\n[219:2](sbe15097.htm#fr_649) Kapilo var _n_ ata _h_ pi\xe1\xb9\x85gala _h_ pi\xe1\xb9\x85gaksha _h_.\n\n[220:1](sbe15097.htm#fr_650) Karu _m_ _s_ rapayitva.\n\n[220:2](sbe15097.htm#fr_651) Name of a Gandharva, as god of love. See _Ri_\ng-veda X, 85, 22. Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga explains the verse differently, so that the\nlast words imply, I come together with my own wife.\n\n[220:3](sbe15097.htm#fr_652) Because speech is dependent on breath, as the\nwife is on the husband. See _Kh_ and. Up. I, 6, 1.\n\n[220:4](sbe15097.htm#fr_653) Because the Sama-veda rests on the _Ri_ g-veda.\n\n[220:5](sbe15097.htm#fr_654) This is a verse which is often quoted and\nexplained. It occurs in the Atharva-veda XIV, 71, as 'amo 'ham asmi si tva _m_\n, samaham asmy _ri_ k tvam, dyaur aham p _ri_ thivi tvam; tav iha sam bhavava\npra _g_ am a ganayavahai.'\n\nHere we have the opposition between ama _h_ and sa, while in the Ait. Brahma\n_n_ a VIII, 27, we have amo 'ham asmi sa tvam, giving ama _h_ in opposition to\nsa. It seems not unlikely that this p. 221 was an old proverbial formula, and\nthat it meant originally no more than 'I am he, and thou art she.' But this\nmeaning was soon forgotten. In the _Kh_ and. Up. I, 6, 1, we find sa explained\nas earth, ama as fire (Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. 13). In the Ait.\nBrahma _n_ a sa is explained as _Ri_ _k_ , ama as Saman. I have therefore in\nour passage also followed the interpretation of the commentary, instead of\nrendering it, 'I am he, and thou art she; thou art she, and I am he.'\n\n[221:1](sbe15097.htm#fr_655) Anulomam, murdhanam arabhya padantam.\n\n[221:2](sbe15097.htm#fr_656) Nirmathitavantau.\n\n[221:3](sbe15097.htm#fr_657) A _s_ vinau devau, Madhyandina text.\n\n[221:4](sbe15097.htm#fr_658) Dadhamahe, Madhyandina text.

Weber) writes: nirgamyamanama _m_ sape _s_ i sa-avara _s_\nabdava _k_ ya, ta _m_ savara _m_ _k_ a nirgamaya.\n\n[222:1](sbe15097.htm#fr_665) These as well as the preceding rules refer to\nmatters generally treated in the G _ri_ hya-sutras; see \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, G _ri_\nhya-sutras I, 13 seq.; Paraskara, G _ri_ hya-sutras I, 11 seq.; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kakyana,\nG _ri_ hya-sutras I, 19 seq. It is curious, however, that \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I,\n13, 1, refers distinctly to the Upanishad as the place where the pu _m_ savana\nand similar matters were treated. This shows that the Upanishads were known\nbefore the composition of the G _ri_ hya-sutras, and explains perhaps, at\nleast partially, why the Upanishads were considered as rahasya. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana\nsays, 'Conception, begetting of a boy, and guarding the embryo are to be found\nin the Upanishad. But if a man does not read the Upanishad, let him know that\nhe should feed his wife,' &c. Naraya _n_ a explains that \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana here\nrefers to an Upanishad which does not exist in his own _S_ akha, but he\nobjects to the conclusion that therefore the garbhadhana and other ceremonies\nneed not be performed, and adds that some hold it should be performed, as\nprescribed by _S_ aunaka and others.\n\n[222:2](sbe15097.htm#fr_666) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, G _ri_ hya-sutra I, 10, 23.\n\n[222:3](sbe15097.htm#fr_667) Trayilaksha _n_ a vak tvayi pravi _s_ atv iti _g_\napato 'bhipraya _h_.\n\n[223:1](sbe15097.htm#fr_668) Cf. Paraskara G _ri_ hya-sutras I, 16, 4,\nanamikaya suvar _n_ antarhitaya; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, G _ri_ hya-sutras I, 24, pra\n_s_ aye _g_ _g_ atarupe _n_ a.\n\n[223:2](sbe15097.htm#fr_669) Bhur bhuva _h_ sva _h_ are explained by\nDvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga as the _Ri_ g-veda, Ya _g_ ur-veda, and Sama-veda. They might\nalso be earth, air, and heaven. See _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, G _ri_ hya-sutras 1, 24;\nBhur _ri_ gveda _m_ tvayi dadhami, &c.\n\n[223:3](sbe15097.htm#fr_670) The Madhyandinas add here another verse, which\nthe father recites while he strokes his boy: 'Be a stone, be an axe, be pure\ngold. Thou art my Self, called my son; live a hundred harvests.' The same\nverse occurs in the \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana G _ri_ hya-sutras I, 15, 3.\n\n[223:4](sbe15097.htm#fr_671) The two ceremonies, here described, are the\nayushya-karman and the medha _g_ anana. They are here treated rather\nconfusedly. Paraskara (G _ri_ hya-sutras I, 16, 3) distinguishes the medha _g_\nanana and the ayushya. He treats the medha _g_ anana first, which consists in\nfeeding the boy with honey and clarified butter, and saying to him bhus tvayi\ndadhami, &c. The ayushya consists in repeating certain verses in the boy's\near, wishing him a long life, &c. In \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana's G _ri_ hya-sutras, I,\n15, 1 contains the ayushya, I, 15, 2 the medhaganana. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana also (I,\n24) treats the ayushya first, and the medha _g_ anana afterwards, and the same\norder prevails in the Madhyandina text of the B _ri_ hadaranyaka-upanishad.\n\n[223:5](sbe15097.htm#fr_672) In the Madhyandina text these acts are\ndifferently arranged.\n\n[223:6](sbe15097.htm#fr_673) _Ri_ g-veda I, 164, 49.\n\n[223:7](sbe15097.htm#fr_674) These verses are differently explained by various\ncommentators. \xc3\x82nandagiri explains i _l_ a as stutya, bhogya. He derives\nMaitravaru _n_ i p. 224 from Maitravaru _n_ a, i.e. Vasish _th_ a, the son of\nMitravaru _n_ au, and identifies her with Arundhati. Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga takes i _d_\na as bhogya, or i _d_ apatri, or p _ri_ thivirupa, and admits that she may be\ncalled Maitravaru _n_ i, because born of Mitravaru _n_ au. Vire is rightly\ntaken as a vocative by Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga, while \xc3\x82nandagiri explains it as a\nlocative, mayi nimittabhute. One expects a _g_ i _g_ ana _h_ instead of a _g_\niganat, which is the reading of A. and B. The reading of the Madhyandinas, a\n_g_ i _g_ anatha _h_ , is right grammatically, but it offends against the\nmetre, and is a theoretical rather than a real form. If we read a _g_ i _g_\nana _h_ , we must also read akara _h_ , unless we are prepared to follow the\ncommentator, who supplies bhavati.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 4: Hume Translation](sbe15098.htm)\n\n"
