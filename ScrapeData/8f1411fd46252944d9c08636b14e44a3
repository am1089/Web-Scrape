By this (discussion) the law of custom, which is observed in (particular)\ncountries or families, has been disposed of. 1\n\n2\\. On account of the blood relations of his mother and (on account of those)\nof his father within six degrees, or, as far as the relationship is traceable,\nhe shall bathe if they die, excepting children that have not completed their\nfirst year. 2\n\n3\\. On account of the death of the latter the parents alone bathe,\n\n4\\. And those who bury them. 4\n\n5\\. If a wife or one of the chief Gurus (a father or \xc3\x82 _k_ arya) die, besides,\nfasting (is ordained from the time at which they die) up to the same time (on\nthe following day). 5\n\np. 138\n\n6\\. (In that case) they shall also show the (following) signs of mourning:\n\n7\\. Dishevelling their hair and covering themselves with dust (they go outside\nthe village), and, clothed with one garment, their faces turned to the south,\nstepping into the river they throw up water for the dead once, and then,\nascending (the bank), they sit down. 7\n\n8\\. This (they repeat) thrice.\n\n9\\. They pour out water consecrated in such a manner that the dead will know\nit (to be given to them). Then they return to the village without looking\nback, and perform those rites for the dead which (pious) women declare to be\nnecessary.\n\n10\\. Some declare, that these same (observances) shall also be kept in the\ncase (of the death) of other (Sapi _n_ _d_ as).\n\n11\\. At all religious ceremonies, he shall feed Brahma _n_ as who are pure and\nwho have (studied and remember) the Veda. 11\n\n12\\. He shall distribute his gifts at the proper places, at the proper times,\nat the occasion of purificatory rites, and to proper recipients. 12\n\n13\\. That food must not be eaten of which (no portion) is offered in the fire,\nand of which no portion is first given (to guests).\n\np. 139\n\n14\\. No food mixed with pungent condiments or salt can be offered as a burnt-\noffering. 14\n\n15\\. Nor (can food) mixed with bad food (be used for a burnt-oblation). 15\n\n16\\. If (he is obliged to offer) a burnt-offering of food unfit for that\npurpose, he shall take hot ashes from the northern part of his fire and offer\nthe food in that. That oblation is no oblation in the fire.\n\n17\\. A female shall not offer any burnt-oblation, 17\n\n18\\. Nor a child, that has not been initiated. 18\n\n19\\. Infants do not become impure before they receive the sacrament called\nAnnapra _s_ ana (the first feeding).\n\n20\\. Some (declare, that they cannot become impure) until they have completed\ntheir first year,\n\n21\\. Or, as long as they cannot distinguish the points of the horizon.\n\n22\\. The best (opinion is, that they cannot be defiled) until the initiation\nhas been performed.\n\n23\\. For at that (time a child) according to the rules of the Veda obtains the\nright (to perform the various religious ceremonies).\n\np. 140\n\n24\\. That ceremony is the limit (from which the capacity to fulfil the law\nbegins).\n\n25\\. And the Sm _ri_ ti (agrees with this opinion). 25\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[137:1](sbe0250.htm#fr_668) **15**. Customs are to be followed only if they\nare not opposed to the teaching of the Vedas and Sm _ri_ tis.\n\n[137:2](sbe0250.htm#fr_669) Manu. V, 60; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_.

According to Haradatta\nthose who know the correct interpretation, declare that the word\' women\'\ndenotes in this Sutra \'the Sm _ri_ tis.\' But I fear these learned interpreters\nwill find few adherents among those who pay attention to the last Sutra of\nthis work.\n\n[138:11](sbe0250.htm#fr_673) Manu III, 128.\n\n[138:12](sbe0250.htm#fr_674) Manu III, 98.\n\n[139:14](sbe0250.htm#fr_675) \'That (substance) is called kshara, "of pungent\nor alkaline taste," the eating of which makes the saliva flow.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[139:15](sbe0250.htm#fr_676) Avaranna, \'bad food,\' is explained by \'kulittha\nand the like.\' Kulittha, a kind of vetch, is considered low food, and eaten by\nthe lower castes only. The meaning of the Sutra, therefore, is, \'If anybody\nhas been forced by poverty to mix his rice or _D_ al with kulittha or similar\nbad food, he cannot offer a burnt-oblation at the Vai _s_ vadeva ceremony with\nthat. He must observe the rule, given in the following Sutra.\n\n[139:17](sbe0250.htm#fr_677) Manu V, 155; XI, 36.\n\n[139:18](sbe0250.htm#fr_678) Manu II, 171.\n\n[140:25](sbe0250.htm#fr_679) Haradatta quotes Gautama II, 1-3, on this point,\nand is apparently of opinion that \xc3\x82pastamba alludes to the same passage. But\nhe is probably wrong, as all Sm _ri_ tis are agreed on the point mentioned by\n\xc3\x82pastamba.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 7, Kha _n_ _d_ a 16](sbe0251.htm)\n\n'
