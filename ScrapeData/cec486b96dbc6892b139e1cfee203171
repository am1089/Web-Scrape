I will now relate the story of Krishnu\'s\njourney to the country about Delhi; listen with attention, how Shree Krishnu\nChund and Bulram went to Koorchetru to bathe on the occasion of an eclipse of\nthe sun, accompanied by all the descendants of Judoo. The Raja said, "O great\nking! be pleased to recite the story; I will listen with attention." Then\nShree Shookdeo Jee said, O great king! on one occasion, having obtained\nintelligence of an eclipse of the sun, Shree Krishnu Chund and Buldeo Jee\nhaving gone to Raja Oogursen said, "O great king! an eclipse of the sun has,\nafter a long interval, occurred, it will be a very virtuous act, if you go to\nKoorchetru, and hold this festival there; because it is written in the\nShastrus, \'That whoever shall offer gifts or do acts of moral or religious\nmerit at Koorchetru, shall be deemed a thousand fold excellent.\'" On hearing\nthese words, the descendants of Judoo enquired from Shree Krishnu Chund Jee,\n"O great king! how did Koorchetru become so eminent a place of pilgrimage, be\npleased to do us the favour to explain?" Shree Krishnu Jee replied, "Listen,\nJumdugun, the sage, was very wise, given to religious meditation, a strict\nperformer of penance and of a glorious reputation. He had three sons, the\neldest of whom was Purshooram, who having\n\np. 406\n\nabandoned the pleasures of the world, went and dwelt in Chitrukoot, and began\nto perform penance in honor of Sudashivu. On the birth of his children,\nJumdugun, the sage, having given up house keeping and forsaken the world, went\ninto the forest with his wife, and began to practise devout austerity; his\nwife\'s name was Renooka, who went one day to invite her sister, who was the\nwife of the Raja Suhusrajoorun; when she had given the invitation, Raja\nSuhusrajoorun\'s wife, the sister of Renooka, indulging in pride, said\nlaughing, \'If sister, you can feed me and my army, give the invitation,\notherwise do not give it.\' O great king! having heard this, Renooka was\nannoyed and rising up thence without speaking a word came home. Perceiving\nthat she was in low spirits, Jumdugun, the sage, enquired, \'What has happened\nto-day, that you are out of humour.\' Upon his making the enquiry, Renooka\nshedding tears, mentioned all the circumstances, as they had occurred. On\nhearing them, Jumdugun, the sage, said to his wife, \'Well! go now and invite\nyour sister with her army.\' When Renooka received her husband\'s order, she\nwent to her sister\'s house and invited her. The sister said to her husband,\n\'You and I, together with our army, must go to-morrow to eat our food at the\nhouse of Jumdugun, the sage.\' Having heard and assented to what his wife said\nhe laughed and was silent. Jumdugun rose very early next morning and went to\nRaja Indru, and asked for the cow Kamdhenoo, and afterwards went and invited,\nand brought back with him the Raja Suhusrajoorun; he came with his army, and\nJumdugun Jee entertained them all with every kind of food they desired. When\nhe and his army had eaten their food, Raja Suhusrajoorun was very much ashamed\nand began to say to himself, \'Whence has he obtained the means of feeding so\nmany people during the night, and how he has prepared the food, I cannot\nunderstand the secret of all this.\' Having thus spoken, and taken leave he\nwent home, and despatched a brahmin, saying\n\np. 407\n\nto him, \'O divinity! go to the house of Jumdugun, and bring me information, by\nwhose power he has, in one day, invited and entertained me and my army.\' On\nhearing these words, the brahmin went off quickly, and having made his\nobservations came back, and said to Suhusrajoorun, \'O great king! the cow\nKamdhenoo is in his house, through whose power he has been able to invite, and\nentertain you in the course of a day.\' Suhusrajoorun said to the brahmin, in\nreply to this intelligence, \'O divinity! go from me, and say to Jumdugun the\nsage, that I beg the cow Kamdhenoo from him.\' The brahmin on hearing these\nwords, went with the message to the sage, and mentioned what Suhusrajoorun had\nsaid. The sage replied, \'The cow does not belong to me, that I can give it, it\nbelongs to Raja Indru, and I cannot give it; go and tell your Raja so.\' Upon\nhis saying this, the brahmin came, and said to Raja Suhusrajoorun, \'O great\nking! the sage says that the cow Kamdhenoo is not his, but belongs to Raja\nIndru; and he cannot give it to you.\' When the brahmin had thus spoken,\nSuhusrajoorun sent for several of his warriors, and said to them, \'Go now, and\nloosen and bring here from the house of Jumdugun the cow Kamdhenoo.\' The\nwarriors, on receiving their master\'s order, went to the sage\'s house; and\nwhen, after having loosened the cow, they carried it off in presence of\nJumdugun, the sage ran and stopped Kamdhenoo on the road. Having received\nintelligence of this, Suhusrajoorun was enraged, and came and cut off the\nsage\'s head, Kamdhenoo ran off to Indru, and Renooka came stood near her\nhusband\'s body, she rolled upon the ground, tearing her hair, and sat down,\nlaying hold of his feet; she struck her breast, shedding tears; and calling\ntenderly upon her husband, poured forth lamentations. At that time, the\nguardian deities of the ten quarters trembled, when they heard the cries and\nweeping of Renooka; and the seat of Purshooram, shook, as he was engaged in\npenance, and his meditations were interrupted. On his meditations being\ndisturbed, Purshooram,\n\np. 408\n\nhaving reflected, took his axe, and came to the spot, where his father\'s\ncorpse had fallen, and where his mother was standing, striking her breast. On\nseeing this, Purshooram Jee became very wroth; and at the same time, Renooka\nexplained with tears to her son all the circumstances of her husband\'s\nslaughter. When he had heard the account, Purshooram went to where\nSuhusrajoorun was seated in the midst of his court, having first said to his\nmother, \'Mother! I will first slay my father\'s enemy, and afterwards come and\ntake up my father\'s body.\' On seeing the Raja, Purshooram Jee said angrily, \'O\npitiless, cowardly, malicious enemy of your family! you have killed my father,\nand brought great grief upon me.\' When having thus spoken, Purshooram seized\nhis axe, and advanced in great wrath, the Raja confronted him with a bow and\narrows. The two strong men began a mighty contest. At length, after they had\nfought about four hours, Purshooram Jee killed and overthrew Suhusrajoorun,\nwhose army then attacked him, and which he also destroyed near the Raja\'s\nbody; he afterwards came thence, and performed his father\'s funeral obsequies;\nand having comforted his mother, Purshooram Jee then offered sacrifice to\nRoodru at that place; and from that time, the place has been called, and\nbecome famous as a place of holy pilgrimage, whoever goes there during an\neclipse of the sun, and offers gifts, or bathes or performs penance or\nsacrifice, will receive a reward of a thousand fold excellence."\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja Pureechit,--O great king! on hearing this story, all the descendants of\nJudoo were delighted, and said to Shree Krishnu Chund Jee, "O great king! be\npleased to go quickly to Koorchetru, and do not now delay, because it is\nnecessary to arrive there in time for the festival." On hearing this, Shree\nKrishnu Chund and Bulram Jee enquired from the Raja Oogursen, "Who, O great\nking! will remain here to guard the city if all go to Koorchetru?" Raja\nOogursen said, "Leave Unroodru Jee and go." Having received the Raja\'s\n\np. 409\n\norder, and having sent for and explained to Unroodru, Krishnu said, "Son!\nremain here, defend the cow and the brahmin and protect the subject, I and the\nRaja Jee, and all the descendants of Judoo will return, after having bathed at\nKoorchetru." Unroodru Jee replied, "I will act according to your order."\n\nHaving, O great king! left Unroodru Jee only to guard the city, Soorsen,\nBasoodeo, Oodho, Akroor, Kritbruma, and all the high and low descendants of\nJudoo with their wives prepared to set out for Koorchetru. When the Raja\nOogursen encamped outside the city with his army, the whole party assembled\ntogether; and afterwards Shree Krishnu Chund Jee joined them, accompanied by\nhis brother\'s wife, eight queens, sixteen thousand eight hundred wives, and\ntheir sons and grandsons, Raja Oogursen decamped thence on Krishnu\'s arrival;\nand advanced with great pomp and bustle, like Raja Indru.\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! after a\npleasant and safe journey of some days, Shree Krishnu Chund and all the\ndescendants of Judoo arrived at Koorchetru; and having gone there, they all\nbathed during the festival; and, each, to the utmost of his means, offered\nelephants, horses, ruths, palkees, dresses, jewels, ornaments, grain or money,\nand afterwards they all encamped there.\n\nO great king! having heard of the journey of Shree Krishnu Chund and Bulram\nJee to Koorchetru, Rajas from the four quarters came with their families and\narmies, and met them. Then all the Kouruvus and Panduvus came there with their\nrelatives and their troops; at that time Koontee and Dropudee went into the\nfemale apartments of the descendants of Judoo, and had interviews with their\nwives; after this Koontee having gone into her brother\'s presence, said,\n"Brother! I am very unfortunate, from the very day I was betrothed I have been\nsuffering affliction, you have not thought of me from the time you gave me in\nmarriage; and Ram Krishnu, who is the bestower of happiness upon all, has not\nshown any kindness towards me."\n\np. 410\n\nOn hearing these words, O great king! Basoodeo Jee taking compassion on her,\nsaid, his eyes being filled with tears, Sister! what dost thou say to me? I\nhave had no [control](errata.htm#24) in these matters, the condition or\ncircumstances of fate are not known. The will of Huri is very powerful,\nbehold! what griefs I endured at the hands of Kuns; the whole world has become\nsubservient to Krishnu; behold! whatever griefs one may suffer, the universe\nis put into circular motion."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, and having entered into explanations with\nhis sister, Basoodeo Jee went to the place, where all the Rajas were seated in\nthe court of Raja Oogursen and Raja Doorjodhun and other great Rajas, and" the\nPanduvus were doing honour to Oogursen: "Raja! you are very fortunate in\nconstantly beholding Shree Krishnu Chund, and obliterating the sins of each\nbirth; the lord, whom Shivu, Bruhmu and all the other gods wander about\nseeking, continually protects you; the Huri, whose mysteries jogees and sages,\nor whose passions are under complete subjection, and saints and wise men\ncannot discover, comes to receive your orders; and he, who is god of the whole\nworld, bows his head to you."\n\nHaving related thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! all the Rajas having come were thus applauding Raja Oogursen, and he,\nwith great propriety, pleased and satisfied them all. In the mean while,\nhaving heard of the arrival of Shree Krishnu and Bulram Jee, Nund and Oopnund\ncame, accompanied by their relations and all the cowherdesses and cowherds,\nand their children. When they were at leisure after bathing and offering\ngifts, Nund Jee went to the place, where Basoodeo and Dewukee were living with\ntheir son, in a state of ease and enjoyment. On seeing them, Basoodeo Jee rose\nand met them; and mutually expressing and feeling affection they were as happy\nas a man would be, who had found a lost thing. Basoodeo Jee then mentioned to\nNund Rae all that had transpired at Bruj formerly,\n\np. 411\n\nhow Nund Rae Jee had brought up Shree Krishnu and Bulram.\n\nOn hearing this account, O great king! Nund Rae Jee\'s eyes filled with tears,\nand he remained gazing on the face of Basoodeo. At that time, Shree Krishnu\nand Buldeo, having, with all becoming propriety, performed obeisance and\nsalutation, first to Nund and Jusodha Jee, went afterwards and had a meeting\nwith the cowherds\' children. The cowherdesses came there, and gazed upon the\nmoon-like countenance of Huri, and delighted their partridge-like eyes (that\nis, their eyes, which gazed at Krishnu, in the same manner as the eyes of the\nChukoor, or Greek partridge, gazes at the moon, of which the bird is said to\nbe enamoured) and received the fruit, or the greatest enjoyment of their\nlives.\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! I cannot\ndescribe the love displayed by Nund, Oopnund, Jusodha, the cowherdesses, the\ncowherds and their children on meeting with Basoodeo, Dewukee, Ranee, Shree\nKrishnu and Bulram; it must have been witnessed to be understood. At length,\nseeing that they were all greatly agitated by their affection, Shree Krishnu\nChund Jee said, "Listen! whatever mortal shall have faith in me, shall be\nfearlessly carried across the sea of existence; you have made an offering of\nyour bodies, minds and wealth, and have looked upon me with a never ending\naffection; no one is equal to you in good fortune; not Bruhmu, Roodru, Indru\nor any one else, whoever he be, I have not come into the meditations of Shivu,\nbut have dwelt with you, and constantly increased my affection. I dwell in the\nbody of each individual: what I now say is incomprehensible and unfathomable,\nas light, water, fire, earth and air abide in the body, so also my splendour\ndwells in the human form."\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! when Shree Krishnu Chund had mentioned\nall these mysteries, all the inhabitants of Bruj recovered their confidence.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXXIII](psa84.htm)\n\n'
