The discourse between Arjuna\nand Krishna on the battle-field, on the eve of the war which forms the\nsubject-matter of the work, was strung together in seven hundred verses and\nput in its place in the body of his great history by Vyasa.\n\nThe Gita opens with Dhritarashtra\'s query to Sanjaya about the progress of\nevents. In the second chapter of the Bhishma Parva, we find Vyasa offering the\npower of sight to the blind king, that he might see the war. Dhritarashtra\ndeclined to have it, saying he did not care to have eyes with which only to\nsee the death of his own people; but he would like to hear what was happening.\nOn this the great Rishi Vyasa said, that all the occurrences in connection\nwith the war would be reflected in the mind of Sanjaya, and he would\nfaithfully report them to Dhritarashtra.\n\nThe Gita is called an Upanishad, because it contains the essence of Self-\nknowledge, and because its teachings, like those of the Vedas, are divided\ninto three sections, Karma (work), Upasana (devotion) and Jnana (knowledge).\n\np. ii\n\nThe first chapter is introductory. The second is a summary of the whole work,\n_e.g._ , in II. 48 and the connected Slokas, self-less work devoid of desire\nfor fruits, is taught for the purification of the heart; in II. 61 and the\nconnected Slokas devotion is taught to the pure-hearted, to qualify them\nfurther for the highest Sannyasa, which last is taught in II. 71 and the\nconnected Slokas.\n\nIt is also usual to divide the work into three sections illustrative of the\nthree terms of the Mahavakya of the Sama-Veda, "Thou art That" (Chhand. Upa.,\nVI. viii. 7). In this view the first six chapters explain the path of work\nwithout desire for fruits, and the nature of "Thou." The next six chapters\ndeal with devotion and the nature of "That." The last six describe the state\nof the highest knowledge and the nature of the middle term of the Mahavakya,\nin other words, the means of re-establishing the identity of "Thou" and\n"That."\n\nThe central teaching of the Gita is the attainment of Freedom, by the\nperformance of one\'s Swadharma or duty in life. "Do thy duty without an eye to\nthe results thereof. Thus shouldst thou gain the purification of heart which\nis essential for Moksha,"--seems to be the keynote of Krishna\'s teachings to\nArjuna.\n\nIt is well known why the Gita came into existence. It was owing to Arjuna\'s\nunwillingness to do his duty as a Kshatriya--to fight for a just\n\np. iii\n\ncause--because it involved the destruction of his own people. Not that Arjuna\ndid not recognise the justice and right of the cause, but he would rather\nrenounce the world and try for Moksha than kill his relatives and friends.\nKrishna\'s characterisation of this weakly sentimental attitude of Arjuna is\nwell known. He called it "Un-Arya-like delusion, contrary to the attainment\nalike of heaven and honour" and exhorted Partha to "yield not to unmanliness"\nbut to "cast off this mean faintheartedness." (II. 2-3). "Could a coward who\nfails to do his duty, be worthy to attain Moksha?"--seems to be Krishna\'s\nrejoinder. Could a man not purified by the fire-ordeal of his Swadharma, could\na renegade, a slave, attain Moksha? No! says the Lord. And this is the lesson\nwe Indians have forgotten all these years, though we have been reading and\ndiscussing the Gita all the time.\n\nS.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Meditation](sbg04.htm)\n\n'
