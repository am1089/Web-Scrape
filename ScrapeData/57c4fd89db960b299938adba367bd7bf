Not non-existence, on account of consciousness.\n\nHere now come forward the Yoga _k_ aras, who hold that cognitions(ideas) only\nare real. There is no reasonable ground, they say, for the view that the\nmanifoldness of ideas is due to the manifoldness of things, since ideas\nthemselves--no less than the things assumed by others--have their distinct\nforms, and hence are manifold. And this manifold nature of ideas is\nsufficiently explained by so-called vasana. Vasana means a flow of ideas\n(states of consciousness--pratyaya) of different character. We observe, e.g.,\nthat a cognition which has the form of a jar (i.e. the idea of a jar) gives\nrise to the cognition of the two halves of a jar, and is itself preceded and\nproduced by the cognition of a jar, and this again by a similar cognition,\n\np. 512\n\nand so on; this is what we call a stream or flow of ideas.--But how, then, is\nit that internal cognitions have the forms of external things, mustard-grains,\nmountains, and so on?--Even if real things are admitted, the Yoga _k_ ara\nreplies, their becoming objects of thought and speech depends altogether on\nthe light of knowledge, for otherwise it would follow that there is no\ndifference between the objects known by oneself and those known by others. And\nthat cognitions thus shining forth to consciousness have forms (distinctive\ncharacteristics) must needs be admitted; for if they were without form they\ncould not shine forth. Now we are conscious only of one such form, viz. that\nof the cognition; that this form at the same time appears to us as something\nexternal (i.e. as the form of an outward thing) is due to error. From the\ngeneral law that we are conscious of ideas and things together only, it\nfollows that the thing is not something different from the idea.\n\nAs, moreover, the fact of one idea specially representing one particular thing\nonly, whether it be a jar or a piece of cloth or anything else, requires for\nits explanation an equality in character of the idea and the thing, those also\nwho hold the existence of external things must needs assume that the idea has\na form similar to that of the thing; and as this suffices for rendering\npossible practical thought and intercourse, there is nothing authorising us to\nassume the existence of things in addition to the ideas. Hence cognitions only\nconstitute reality; external things do not exist.\n\nTo this the Sutra replies, 'Not non-existence, on account of consciousness.'\nThe non-existence of things, apart from ideas, cannot be maintained, because\nwe are conscious of cognitions as what renders the knowing subject capable of\nthought and intercourse with regard to particular _things_. For the\nconsciousness of all men taking part in worldly life expresses itself in forms\nsuch as 'I know the jar.' Knowledge of this kind, as everybody's consciousness\nwill testify, presents itself directly as belonging to a knowing subject and\nreferring to an object; those therefore who\n\np. 513\n\nattempt to prove, on the basis of this very knowledge, that Reality is\nconstituted by mere knowledge, are fit subjects for general derision. This\npoint has already been set forth in detail in our refutation of those crypto-\nBauddhas who take shelter under a pretended Vedic theory.--To maintain, as the\nYoga _k_ aras do, that the general rule of idea and thing presenting\nthemselves together proves the non-difference of the thing from the idea,\nimplies a self-contradiction; for 'going together' can only be where there are\ndifferent things. To hold that it is a general rule that of the idea--the\nessential nature of which is to make the thing to which it refers capable of\nentering into common thought and intercourse--we are always conscious together\nwith the thing, and then to prove therefrom that the thing is not different\nfrom the idea, is a laughable proceeding indeed. And as, according to you,\ncognitions perish absolutely, and do not possess any permanently persisting\naspect, it is rather difficult to prove that such cognitions form a series in\nwhich each member colours or affects the next one (vasana); for how is the\nearlier cognition, which has absolutely perished, to affect the later one,\nwhich has not yet arisen? We conclude therefore that the manifoldness of\ncognitions is due solely to the manifoldness of things. We are directly\nconscious of cognitions (ideas) as rendering the things to which they refer\ncapable of being dealt with by ordinary thought and speech, and the specific\ncharacter of each cognition thus depends on the relation which connects it\nwith a particular thing. This relation is of the nature of conjunction (sa _m_\nyoga), since knowledge(cognition)also is a substance. Just as light (prabha),\nalthough a substance, stands to the lamp in the relation of an attribute (gu\n_n_ a), so knowledge stands in the relation of an attribute to the Self, but,\nviewed in itself, it is a substance.--From all this it follows that external\nthings are not non-existent.\n\nThe next Sutra refutes the opinion of those who attempt to prove the\nbaselessness of the cognitions of the waking state by comparing them to the\ncognitions of a dreaming person.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 28.
