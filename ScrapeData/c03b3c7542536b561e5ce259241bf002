If disease befalls one who has set up the (sacred _S_ rauta) fires, he\nshould leave his home (and go away) to the eastern, or northern, or north-\neastern direction.\n\n2\\. 'The sacred fires are fond of the village'\xc2\x97thus it is said.\n\n3 3. Longing for it, desirous of returning to the village they might restore\nhim to health-thus it is understood (in the _S_ ruti).\n\n4 4. Being restored to health, he should offer a Soma sacrifice, or an animal\nsacrifice, or an ordinary sacrifice, and take his dwelling (again in the\nvillage).\n\n5 5. Or without such a sacrifice.\n\n6\\. If he dies, one should have a piece of ground dug up to the south-east or\nto the south-west\xc2\x97\n\n7\\.
