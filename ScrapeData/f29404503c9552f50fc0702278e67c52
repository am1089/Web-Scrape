He equips (the Mahavira) with its equipments;--inasmuch as he\nequips it therewith from this and that quarter, that is the equipping nature\nof the equipments 1 (sambhara): wheresoever anything of the sacrifice is\ninherent, therewith he equips it 2.\n\n14:1:2:22\\. He gets ready a black antelope-skin,--for the black antelope-skin\nis the sacrifice 3: it is at the\n\np. 448\n\nsacrifice he thus prepares (the pot);--with its hairy side (upwards),--for the\nhairs are the metres: on the metres he thus prepares it;--(spread out) on the\nleft (north) side 1,--for the north is the quarter of men;--on (the skin) with\nits neck-part to the east 2, for that (tends) towards the gods.\n\n14:1:2:33\\. With a spade (he digs out the clay), for the spade is a\nthunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is vigour: with vigour he thus supplies and\ncompletes it (the Pravargya).\n\n14:1:2:44\\. It is made of Udumbara (Ficus glomerata) wood, for the Udumbara is\nstrength 3: with strength, with vital sap, he thus supplies and completes it.\n\n14:1:2:55\\. Or of Vika\xe1\xb9\x85kata (Flacourtia sapida) wood; for when Pra _g_ apati\nperformed his first offering, a Vika\xe1\xb9\x85kata tree sprang forth from that place\nwhere, after offering, he cleansed (his hands); now an offering is a\nsacrifice, and (consequently) the Vika\xe1\xb9\x85kata is\n\np. 449\n\nthe sacrifice: with the sacrifice he thus supplies and completes it.\n\n14:1:2:66\\. It is a cubit long, for a cubit means the (fore-) arm, and with\nthe arm strength is exerted: it (the spade) thus is composed of strength, and\nwith strength he thus supplies and completes it.\n\n14:1:2:77\\. He takes it up, with (Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 1), 'At the impulse of\nthe god Savit _ri_ , I take thee by the arms of the A _s_ vins, by the hands\nof Pushan: thou art a woman;'--the import (of this formula) is the same as\nbefore 1.\n\n14:1:2:88\\. Having placed it in his left hand, he touches it with the right,\nand mutters (Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 2), 'They harness the mind, and they harness\nthe thoughts, the priests of the priest, of the great inspirer of devotion;\nthe knower of the rites alone hath assigned the priestly offices: great is the\npraise of the god Savit _ri_ ;'--the import of this is the same as before 2.\n\n14:1:2:99\\. He then takes the lump of clay with the (right) hand and spade on\nthe right (south) side, and with the (left) hand alone on the left (north)\nside 3, with (Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 3), 'O divine Heaven and Earth,'--for when\nthe sacrifice had its head cut off, its sap flowed away, and entered the sky\nand the earth: what clay (firm matter) there was that is this (earth), and\nwhat water there was that is yonder (sky); hence it is of clay and water that\nthe Mahavira (vessels) are made: he thus supplies and\n\np. 450\n\ncompletes it (the Pravargya) with that sap; wherefore he says, 'O divine\nHeaven and Earth,'--'May I this day compass for you Makha's head,'--Makha\nbeing the sacrifice, he thus says, 'May I this day accomplish for you 1 the\nhead of the sacrifice;'--'on the Earth's place of divine worship,'--for on a\nplace of divine worship of the earth he prepares it;--'for Makha thee! for\nMakha's head thee!'--Makha being the sacrifice, he thus says, 'For the\nsacrifice (I consecrate) thee, for the head of the sacrifice (I consecrate)\nthee.'\n\n14:1:2:1010\\. Then an ant-hill 2 (he takes, and puts on the skin), with (Va\n_g_. S. XXXVII, 4), 'Ye divine ants,'--for it was they that produced this:\njust in accordance with the way in which the head of the sacrifice was there\ncut off, he now supplies and completes it with those (ants);--'the firstborn\nof the world,'--the firstborn of the world, doubtless, is this earth 3: it\nthus is therewith that\n\np. 451\n\nhe supplies and completes it;--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on\nthe Earth's place of divine worship:--for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!'\n--the import of this is the same as before.\n\n14:1:2:1111\\. Then (earth) torn up by a boar (he takes), with (Va _g_. S.\nXXXVII, 5), 'Only thus large was she in the beginning,'--for, indeed, only so\nlarge was this earth in the beginning, of the size of a span. A boar, called\nEmusha, raised her up, and he was her lord Pra _g_ apati: with that mate, his\nheart's delight, he thus supplies and completes him 1;--'may I this day\ncompass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha\nthee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.\n\n14:1:2:1212\\. Then \xc3\x82dara 2 (-plants), with (Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 6), 'Indra's\nmight ye are,'--for when Indra encompassed him (Vish _n_ u) with might, then\nthe vital sap of him, thus encompassed, flowed away; and he lay there\nstinking, as it were. He said, 'Verily, after bursting open (a-dar), as it\nwere, this vital sap has sung praises:' thence \xc3\x82dara (-plants originated); and\nbecause he lay there stinking (puy), as it were, therefore (they are also\ncalled) Putika; and hence, when placed on the fire\n\np. 452\n\nas an offering, they blaze; and hence also they are fragrant, for they\noriginated from the vital sap of the sacrifice. And inasmuch as Indra, on that\noccasion, encompassed him with might, therefore he says, 'Indra's might ye\nare;'--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of\ndivine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is\nthe same as before.\n\n14:1:2:1313\\. Then goat's milk;---for when the sacrifice had its head cut off,\nits heat went out of it, wherefrom the goat was produced: it is with that heat\n1 that he thereby supplies and completes it;--with, 'For Makha thee! for\nMakha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.\n\n14:1:2:1414\\. These, then, are the five equipments with which he equips (the\nPravargya),--fivefold is the sacrifice, and fivefold the victims, and five\nseasons are in the year, and the year is he that shines yonder, and the\nPravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies. These (objects),\nthus brought together, he touches with, 'For Makha (I consecrate) thee! for\nMakha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.\n\n14:1:2:1515\\. Now there is an enclosed space 2 on the north\n\np. 453\n\nside: whilst proceeding towards that (shed) they mutter (Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 7;\nRig-v. I, 40, 3), 'May Brahma _n_ aspati go forward!'--Brahma _n_ aspati (the\nlord of devotion) doubtless is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also\nis that one: it is him he thus gratifies; hence he says, 'May Brahma _n_\naspati go forward;'--'may the goddess Gladness go forward!'--for the goddess\nGladness she (Va _k_  1) is;--'unto the hero 2, kindly to men and the\ndispenser of fivefold (offerings),'--he thereby praises and magnifies it (the\nPravargya),--'unto the sacrifice may the gods lead us!'--he thereby makes all\nthe gods its guardians.\n\n14:1:2:1616\\. It is an enclosed space;--for at that time the gods were afraid,\nthinking, 'We hope that the fiends, the Rakshas, will not injure here this our\n(Pravargya):' they accordingly enclosed for it this stronghold, and in like\nmanner does this (Sacrificer) now enclose for it this stronghold.\n\n14:1:2:1717\\. He then deposits (the sambharas 3) on the mound with, 'For Makha\nthee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before. He\nthen takes a lump of clay and makes the Mahavira (pot) with, 'For Makha thee!\nfor Makha's head thee,'--the import of this is\n\np. 454\n\nthe same as before;--a span high 1, for the head is, as it were, a span\nhigh;--contracted in the middle 2, for the head is, as it were, contracted in\nthe middle. At the top he then draws it out (so as to form) a spout 3 of three\nthumbs' breadths (high): he thereby makes a nose to this (Mahavira, or\nPravargya). When it is complete, he touches it with (Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 8),\n'Makha's head thou art,'--for it indeed is the head of Makha Saumya (the Soma-\nsacrifice). In the same way (he makes) the other two (Mahavira pots 4);\nsilently two milking-bowls (pinvana 5), and silently two Rauhi _n_ a-plates 6.\n\n14:1:2:1818\\. Verily this sacrifice is Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati\n\np. 455\n\nis both of this, defined and undefined, limited and unlimited 1. Whatever one\ndoes with a Ya _g_ us formula, by that one makes up that form of him (Pra _g_\napati) which is defined and limited; and whatever one does silently, by that\none makes up that form of him which is undefined and unlimited: verily, then,\nwhosoever, knowing this, does it on this wise, makes up that whole and\ncomplete Pra _g_ apati. But he also leaves over a lump of spare (clay) for\nexpiations.\n\n14:1:2:1919\\. He then smooths 2 it by means of Gavedhuka grass (Coix barbata),\n--for when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its vital sap flowed away, and\ntherefrom those plants grew up: with that vital sap he thus supplies and\ncompletes it;--with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of\nthis is the same as before, In the same way the other two (Mahavira pots);\nsilently the two milking-bowls, silently the two Rauhi _n_ a-plates.\n\n14:1:2:2020\\. He then fumigates these (vessels) with (Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 9),\n'With dung of the stallion, the impregnator, I fumigate thee,'--for the\n\np. 456\n\nstallion is an impregnator, and the impregnator means vigour: with vigour he\nthus supplies and completes it,--'on the Earth's place of divine worship: for\nMakha thee, for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.\nIn the same way (he fumigates) the other two (Mahavira pots); silently the two\nmilking-bowls, and silently the two Rauhi _n_ a-plates.\n\n14:1:2:2121\\. He then bakes them, for what is baked belongs to the gods. He\nbakes them by means of bricks, for they it was that did so on that occasion 1:\njust in accordance with the way in which the head of the sacrifice was there\ncut off, he now supplies and completes it with those (bricks), But, indeed,\nlet him bake them with anything 2 whereby they may become properly baked.\nHaving laid down the fuel for baking 3, he puts down the Mahavira (pot), with,\n'For Makha thee, for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as\nbefore. In the same way the other two Mahavira (pots); silently the two\nmilking-bowls, silently the two Rauhi _n_ a-plates. By day he should bury them\n(in the hole), and by day he should take them out, for the day belongs to the\ngods.\n\np. 457\n\n14:1:2:2222\\. He takes out (the first pot) with (Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 10), 'For\nthe righteous one (I take) thee,'--the righteous one, doubtless, is yonder\nworld, for the righteous one means truth; and he that shines yonder is the\ntruth, and the first Pravargya is that (god): it is him he thus gratifies, and\ntherefore he says, 'For the righteous one (I take) thee.'\n\n14:1:2:2323\\. With, 'For the efficient one thee' (he takes out the second\npot),--the efficient one (sadhu), doubtless, is he (Vayu, the wind) that\npurifies here by blowing, for as a permanent one (siddha) he blows through\nthese worlds; and the second Pravargya is that (god): it is him he thus\ngratifies, and therefore he says, 'For the efficient one (I take) thee.'\n\n14:1:2:2424\\. With, 'For a good abode thee!' (he takes out the third pot),--\nthe good abode, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, for it is in this\nworld that all creatures abide; and the good abode also is Agni (fire), for\nAgni abides with all creatures 1 in this world; and the third Pravargya is\nthat (god): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For a good\nabode thee.' Silently (he takes out) the two milking-bowls, and silently the\ntwo Rauhi _n_ a-plates.\n\n14:1:2:2525\\. He then pours goat's milk upon them 2 (the\n\np. 458\n\nfirst) with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is\nthe same as before. In the same way the other two; silently the two milking-\nbowls, and silently the two Rauhi _n_ a-plates.\n\n14:1:2:2626\\. And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this\n(Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance of the rule\nthereof is the same as at the creation 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[447:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1187) See part i, p. 276, note 1. Here, as formerly,\nit has not been thought desirable to adhere throughout to the technical\nrendering of 'sam-bh _ri_ '\n\n[447:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1188) Pravargya being masculine, the original would,\nof course, have 'him' here and throughout, the ceremony (just like the\nsacrifice in general) being indeed looked upon as a person.\n\n[447:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1189) See part i, p. 23, note 2. In making the Gharma,\nor Mahavira, p. 448 pot, on the present occasion, the order of proceeding is\nto a considerable extent the same as that followed at the Agni _k_ ayana, in\nproviding the materials for, and making, the fire-pan, for which, see VI, 3,\n3, 1 seqq. Cf. also the \xc3\x82pastamba _S_ rautas. XV, with Garbe's Translation and\nNotes, Journal of Germ. Or. Soc., vol. xxxiv.\n\n[448:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1190) That is, immediately north of the lump of clay\n(previously prepared by a potter) and the other objects to be used for making\nthe Mahavira pot, which have been previously deposited near the anta _h_ patya\npeg marking the middle of the west or hinder side of the Mahavedi.\n\n[448:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1191) The locative, instead of the accusative, is\nrather strange here. As it stands, the locative is evidently parallel to 'ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ e' and ' _kh_ anda _h_ su,' and one has therefore to supply--he\ncollects (prepares) the Pravargya, viz. by putting the lump of clay and the\nother objects thereon.\n\n[448:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1192) See VI, 6, 3, 2 seqq.\n\n[449:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1193) See I, 1, 2, 17; VI, 3, 1, 38 seq.\n\n[449:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1194) See III, 5, 3, 11-12.\n\n[449:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1195) Between the two actions referred to in\n[paragraphs 8](sbe44118.htm#14:1:2:8) and [9](sbe44118.htm#14:1:2:9), the\ndigging up of the clay takes place, and hence the spade, or trowel, has\nchanged hands. Cf. VI, 4, 2, 2.\n\n[450:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1196) The pronouns in this and the subsequent\ncorresponding formulas (va _m_ , va _h_ , te) are taken by Mahidhara as\naccusatives ('te' according to him standing for 'tvam') to which he supplies\n'adaya'--'having taken you, may I this day compass Makha's head.' The pronouns\nare certainly somewhat awkward, as they can scarcely be taken as genitives of\nmaterial--of you, of thee.\n\n[450:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1197) See VI, 3, 3, 5, where 'valmikavapa' is\nqualified by 'sushira,' hollow. The comm. on Katy. XXVI, 1, 2 explains\n'valmikavapa' as the vapa (omentum)-like inner lump (? surrounded by a kind of\nnet) of an ant-hill: in the present case, this substance is likewise placed on\nthe black antelope-skin to be mixed with the clay.\n\n[450:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1198) Whilst in the text of the formula this word must\nbe taken as being plural 'prathama _g_ a _h_ ,' the Brahma _n_ a (making use\nof the Sandhi-form) treats it as if it were singular 'prathama _g_ a.'\nMahidhara also, apparently influenced by the Brahma _n_ a, explains, 'the\nearth is the firstborn of creatures, and, from their connection with it, ants\nalso are called firstborn.'\n\n[451:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1199) That is, he supplies Pra _g_ apati (and hence\nalso his counterpart, the Sacrificer) with the Earth, his mate. See J. Muir,\nOrig. Sansk. Texts, vol. i, p. 53; vol. iv, p. 27; and cp. Taitt. I, 10, 8,\nwhere the earth is said to have been uplifted by a black boar with a thousand\narms.\n\n[451:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1200) At IV, 5, 10, 4 we met with this plant--here\nalso called Putika, and explained, by the comm. on Katy., as = the flowers (!)\nof the Rohisha plant (? Guilandina, or Caesalpinia, Bonducella)--as a\nsubstitute for Soma-plants.\n\n[452:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1201) Thus perhaps ' _s_ u _k_ ' should also have been\nrendered at VI, 4, 4, 7, where it is used in connection with the ass.\n\n[452:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1202) Viz. a space five cubits square enclosed with\nmats on all sides, and with a door on the east side, the ground being raised\nin the middle so as to form a mound covered with sand (cf. III, 1, 2, 2). The\nobject of this enclosed space is to prevent any unauthorised person (such as\nthe Sacrificer's wife, and people uninstructed in the scriptures) from seeing\nthe manufacturing of the Mahivira (during which the door is kept closed), as\nwell as the completed pot. p. 453 The place is to the north of the anta _h_\npatya peg, the black antelope-skin being spread to the south of it (and\nimmediately north of the materials used in making the pot).\n\n[453:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1203) Thus Mahidhara, on Va _g_. S. XXXIII, 89.\n\n[453:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1204) 'Vira,' apparently an allusion to 'Maha-vira'\n(great hero), the name of the pot used at the Pravargya.\n\n[453:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1205) Viz. as placed on the black antelope-skin which\nis carried northwards to the enclosed place by the Adhvaryu and his assistants\ntaking hold of it on all sides.\n\n[454:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1206) That is, from bottom to top, a belt (mekhala)\nrunning round it at the distance of three thumbs' breadths from the top\n(Mahidhara, and comm. on Katy.). This top part above the belt--here simply\ncalled 'mouth,' whilst in the \xc3\x82past. _S_ r. XV, 2, 14 it is called 'back'\n(sanu)--ends in a hole for pouring the liquid in and out.\n\n[454:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1207) That is, for taking hold of it (mush _t_ igraha\n_n_ ayogyam, comm. on Katy.).\n\n[454:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1208) 'Mukha,' for which Katy. XXVI, 1, 16 has 'ase\n_k_ ana' explained by the commentator as a hole (garta; comm. on \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G\n_ri_ hyas. IV, 3 bila), apparently serving as the mouth, or open part of the\nvessel which seems to be otherwise closed. The edge of the hole would seem to\nprotract sufficiently from the surface to suggest a similarity to the nose. In\nmaking the vessel, it seems first to be left solid, the open part which is to\nhold the milk being then hollowed out by means of a reed from the top hole to\nthe depth of less than the upper half, the remainder remaining solid. Cf. \xc3\x82\n_s_ v. _S_ r. XV, 3, 4.\n\n[454:4](sbe44118.htm#fr_1209) Only the first of the three pots is, however,\nactually used; unless it gets broken by accident.\n\n[454:5](sbe44118.htm#fr_1210) According to the comm. on Katy. Sr., these\nvessels are of the form of the (hand-shaped) bowl of an offering-ladle (sru\n_k_ , cf. part i, p. 67, note 2).\n\n[454:6](sbe44118.htm#fr_1211) The Rauhi _n_ a-kapalas are two round, flat\ndishes for baking the Rauhi _n_ a cakes on.\n\n[455:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1212) Cf. J. Muir, Orig. Sansk. Texts, vol. v, p. 393,\nwhere a passage is quoted from Prof. Cowell's translation of the Maitri-\nUpanishad (VI, 3), 'There are two forms of Brahma, the embodied (murta) and\nthe unembodied (amurta): the former is unreal (asatya), the latter real\n(satya).'--Cf. Sat. Br. VI, 5, 3, 7.\n\n[455:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1213) The Sutras use the verbs ' _s_ laksh _n_ ayati,\n_s_ laksh _n_ ikurvanti' (to make smooth, or soft), and this, I think, must\nindeed be the meaning of 'hinv.' It would also suit very well the passage III,\n5, 1, 35, where it is said that the Vedi is a woman, and that, by sprinkling\nthe former with water, one 'makes her smooth' for the gods. The polishing of\nthe vessels is done by rubbing them with Gavedhuka grass, whether with the\nspike, stem, or leaves is not specified.\n\n[456:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1214) That is, when the Ukha was baked, cf. VI, 5, 4,\n1; or, perhaps,--they it was that (the gods) made at this juncture. The former\ntranslation is more in accordance with what follows, though one would expect\n'etad' to mean 'at this time.'\n\n[456:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1215) That is, without using bricks (?).\n\n[456:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1216) Viz. in a square hole dug for the purpose east\nof the Garhapatya; the pot being then placed bottom upwards on the burning\nmaterial, dry herbs, wood, &c. According to \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. XV, 3, 20 such\nmaterials are to be used as, whilst being burnt, dye red.\n\n[457:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1217) The accusative with 'kshi' (to inhabit) is\nrather peculiar here.\n\n[457:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1218) As the pots are, however, standing with their\nopen parts upwards, on sand north of the hole in which they were baked, it\nwould chiefly be inside that they would receive the milk, being thereby cooled\n(cf. VI, 5, 4, 15). According to \xc3\x82pastamba, sand is in the first place heaped\nup around them in the sunwise fashion, i.e. keeping them on the right side\nwhilst strewing it.\n\n[458:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1219) That is to say, as would seem,--even as, in\ncreating the universe, Pra _g_ apati reconstructs his body, or constructs\nhimself a new body, so the Sacrificer, in keeping up the observance of the\nPravargya, constructs himself a new body for the future life.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIV, 1, 3.
