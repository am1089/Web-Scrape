By means (or, in the form) of Agni he entered into union with the\nEarth: thence an egg arose. He touched it: 'May it grow! May it grow and\nmultiply!' he said.\n\n6:1:2:22\\. And the embryo which was inside was created as Vayu (the wind). And\nthe tear which had formed itself became those birds. And the juice which was\nadhering to the shell became those sun-motes. And that which was the shell\nbecame the air.\n\n6:1:2:33\\. He desired, 'May it multiply, may it reproduce itself!' By means of\nVayu he entered into union with the Air: thence an egg arose. He touched it,\nsaying, 'Bear thou glory!' From it yonder sun was created, for he indeed is\nglorious. And the tear which (a _s_ ru) formed itself became that variegated\npebble (a _s_ man); for 'a _s_ ru' indeed is what\n\np. 149\n\nthey mystically call 'a _s_ man,' for the gods love the mystic. And the juice\nwhich was adhering to the shell became those sunbeams. And that which was the\nshell became the sky.\n\n6:1:2:44\\. He desired, 'May it multiply, may it reproduce itself!' By means of\nthe Sun he entered into union with the Sky: thence an egg arose. He touched\nit, saying, 'Bear thou seed!' From it the moon was created, for he (the moon)\nis seed. And the tear which formed itself became those stars. And the juice\nwhich was adhering to the shell became those intermediate quarters; and that\nwhich was the shell became those (chief) quarters (points of the compass).\n\n6:1:2:55\\. Having created these worlds, he desired, 'May I create such\ncreatures as shall be mine in these worlds!'\n\n6:1:2:66\\. By his Mind (manas) he entered into union with Speech (va _k_ ): he\nbecame pregnant with eight drops. They were created as those eight Vasus 1: he\nplaced them on this (earth).\n\n6:1:2:77\\. By his Mind he entered into union with Speech: he became pregnant\nwith eleven drops. They were created as those eleven Rudras 2: he placed them\nin the air.\n\n6:1:2:88\\. By his Mind he entered into union with Speech: he became pregnant\nwith twelve drops. They were created as the twelve \xc3\x82dityas 3: he placed them\nin the sky.\n\np. 150\n\n6:1:2:99\\. By his Mind he entered into union with Speech: he became pregnant.\nHe created the All-gods: he placed them in the quarters.\n\n6:1:2:1010\\. And so they say, 'After Agni having been created, the Vasus were\ncreated: he placed them on this (earth);--after Vayu, the Rudras: (he placed)\nthem in the air;--after the sun, the \xc3\x82dityas: (he placed) them in the\nsky;--after the moon, the All-gods 1: he placed them in the quarters.'\n\n6:1:2:1111\\. And so they say, 'Pra _g_ apati, having created these worlds, was\nfirmly established on the earth. For him these plants were ripened 2 into\nfood: that he ate. He became pregnant. From the upper vital airs he created\nthe gods, and from the lower vital airs the mortal creatures.' In whatever way\nhe created thereafter, so he created; but indeed it was Pra _g_ apati who\ncreated everything here, whatsoever exists.\n\n6:1:2:1212\\. Having created creatures he, having run the whole race, became\nrelaxed 3; and therefore even now he who runs the whole race becomes indeed\n\np. 151\n\nrelaxed. From him being thus relaxed, the vital air went out from within. When\nit had gone out of him the gods left him.\n\n6:1:2:1313\\. He said to Agni, 'Restore me!'--'What will then accrue to me?'\nsaid he.--'They shall call me after thee; for whichever of the sons succeeds\n(in life), after him they call the father, grandfather, son, and grandson:\nthey shall call me after thee,--restore me, then!'--'So be it!' so (saying)\nAgni restored him: therefore, while being Pra _g_ apati, they call him Agni;\nand verily, whosoever knows this, after him they call his father, grandfather,\nson, and grandson.\n\n6:1:2:1414\\. He said, 'Whereon shall we set thee up 1?'--'On the hita (set, or\nsuitable, good)!' he said: the vital air is indeed something good, for the\nvital air is good for all beings. And inasmuch as he set him up on the hita,\ntherefore one says, 'I shall set up, I am setting up, I have set up 2.'\n\n6:1:2:1515\\. As to this they say, 'What is hita, and what is upahita?' The\nvital air, forsooth, is the 'hita,' and speech is the 'upahita,' for it is on\nthe vital air that this speech is based (upa-hita). The vital air, again, is\nthe 'hita,' and the limbs are the 'upahita,' for on the vital air these limbs\nare indeed based.\n\n6:1:2:1616\\. This, then, was his (Pra _g_ apati's) ' _k_ itya' (Agni to be set\nup on an altar-pile); for he had to be built up ( _k_ i) by him, and therefore\nwas his ' _k_ itya.' And\n\np. 152\n\nso indeed he now is the Sacrificer's ' _k_ itya;' for he is to be built up by\nhim, and therefore is his ' _k_ itya.'\n\n6:1:2:1717\\. Now it was those five bodily parts (tanu) of his (Pra _g_\napati's) that became relaxed,--hair, skin, flesh, bone, and marrow,--they are\nthese five layers (of the fire-altar); and when he builds up the five layers,\nthereby he builds him up by those bodily parts; and inasmuch as he builds up (\n_k_ i), therefore they are layers ( _k_ iti).\n\n6:1:2:1818\\. And that Pra _g_ apati who became relaxed is the year; and those\nfive bodily parts of his which became relaxed are the seasons; for there are\nfive seasons, and five are those layers: when he builds up the five layers, he\nthereby builds him up with the seasons; and inasmuch as he builds up (lays\ndown), therefore they are layers.\n\n6:1:2:1919\\. And that Pra _g_ apati, the year, who became relaxed, is that\nvery Vayu (wind) who blows yonder. And those five bodily parts of his, the\nseasons, which became relaxed, are the regions (or quarters) 1; for five in\nnumber are the regions, and five those layers: when he builds up the five\nlayers, he builds him up with the regions; and inasmuch as he builds up,\ntherefore they are layers.\n\n6:1:2:2020\\. And the Fire that is laid down on the built (altar), that is\nyonder Sun;--that same Agni is indeed (raised) on the altar, and that just\nbecause Agni had restored him (Pra _g_ apati).\n\n6:1:2:2121\\. But they say,--Pra _g_ apati, when relaxed, said to the gods,\n'Restore me!' The gods said to Agni, 'In thee we will heal this our father Pra\n_g_ apati.'--\n\np. 153\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Then I will enter into him, when whole,' he said.--'So\nbe it!' they said. Hence, while being Pra _g_ apati, they yet call him Agni.\n\n6:1:2:2222\\. In the fire the gods healed him by means of oblations; and\nwhatever oblation they offered that became a baked brick and passed into him.\nAnd because they were produced from what was offered (ish _t_ a), therefore\nthey are bricks (ish _t_ aka). And hence they bake the bricks by means of the\nfire, for it is oblations they thus make.\n\n6:1:2:2323\\. He spake, 'Even as much as ye offer, even so much is my\nhappiness:' and inasmuch as for him there was happiness (ka) in what was\noffered (ish _t_ a), therefore also they are bricks (ish _t_ aka).\n\n6:1:2:2424\\. Here now \xc3\x82ktakshya used to say, 'Only he who knows abundant\nbricks possessed of (special) prayers, should build up the fire (altar):\nabundantly indeed he then heals Father Pra _g_ apati.'\n\n6:1:2:2525\\. But Ta _n_ _d_ ya used to say, 'Surely the bricks possessed of\nprayers are the nobility, and the space-fillers 1 are the peasants; and the\nnoble is the feeder, and the peasantry the food; and where there is abundant\nfood for the feeder, that realm is indeed prosperous and thrives: let him\ntherefore pile up abundant space-fillers!' Such then was the speech of those\ntwo, but the settled practice is different therefrom.\n\n6:1:2:2626\\. Now that father (Pra _g_ apati) is (also) the son:\n\np. 154\n\ninasmuch as he created Agni, thereby he is Agni's father; and inasmuch as Agni\nrestored him, thereby Agni is his (Pra _g_ apati's) father; and inasmuch as he\ncreated the gods, thereby he is the father of the gods; and inasmuch as the\ngods restored him, thereby the gods are his fathers.\n\n6:1:2:2727\\. Twofold verily is this,--father and son, Pra _g_ apati and Agni,\nAgni and Pra _g_ apati, Pra _g_ apati and the gods, the gods and Pra _g_\napati--(for) whosoever knows this.\n\n6:1:2:2828\\. He builds up with 1, 'By that deity'--that deity, doubtless, is\nVa _k_ (speech),--'A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like,'--A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, doubtless, is the breath;--'lie\nthou steady!'--that is, 'lie thou firm;' or 'lie thou firmly established.' It\nis both with speech and with breath that he builds; for Agni is speech, and\nIndra is the breath; and the fire (agni) relates to Indra and Agni: as great\nas Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus builds him up. And\nagain, Indra and Agni are all the gods, (for) Agni belongs to all deities:\nthus as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus\nbuilds him up.\n\n6:1:2:2929\\. Here now they say, 'Wherefore is Agni (the fire-altar) built of\nthis (earth)?' But, surely, when that deity (Pra _g_ apati) became relaxed\n(fell asunder), he flowed along this (earth) in the shape of his life-sap; and\nwhen the gods restored him (put him together), they gathered him up from this\nearth: this earth then is that one brick 2, for Agni is this earth, since\n\np. 155\n\nit is thereof 1 that the whole Agni is built up. Now this earth is four-\ncornered, for the quarters are her corners: hence the bricks are four-\ncornered; for all the bricks are after the manner of this earth.\n\n6:1:2:3030\\. As to this they say, 'But if he (Agni) thus consists of one\nbrick, how then (comes he to be) a five-bricked 2 one?' Now surely the first\nbrick of clay is this earth,--whatever made of clay he places on that (altar)\nthat is that one brick. And when he puts thereon the heads of the animal\nvictims 3, that is the animal-brick. And when he puts on the gold plate and\nman 4, when he scatters gold shavings thereon, that is the golden brick. And\nwhen he puts on two spoonfuls (of ghee) 5 when he puts on the mortar and\npestle 6, and fire-sticks, that is the wood-brick. And when he puts on a\nlotus-leaf (petal), a tortoise 7, sour curds, honey, ghee, and whatever other\nfood he puts on, that is the fifth brick, the food. Thus, then, it is a five-\nbricked (Agni).\n\n6:1:2:3131\\. As to this they say, 'On which side is the head of the\nbrick?'--'Where he touches it and says a prayer,' so say some, 'on one end of\nthe naturally perforated (brick) 8 alone indeed should he\n\np. 156\n\nsay a prayer while touching it, but thus all those (bricks) of his are turned\ntowards the naturally perforated one.' Let him not do so, for those bricks\ndoubtless are his (Agni's) limbs, his joints; and it would be just as if he\nwere to put a head on each limb, on each joint. But indeed, the fire which is\ndeposited on the pile, that is the head of all those (bricks).\n\n6:1:2:3232\\. Here they say, 'How many animal victims are laid upon the fire\n(altar)?'--Let him say 'Five,' for he does lay thereon those five victims.\n\n6:1:2:3333\\. Or, 'One,' he may say; 'a ewe;' for a ewe (avi) is this earth,\nsince she favours (av) all these creatures. And the fire (altar) also is this\nearth, for the whole fire (altar) is built up thereof: hence he may say,\n'One.'\n\n6:1:2:3434\\. Or, 'Two,' he may say, 'two sheep;' for sheep, indeed, are both\nthis (earth) and that (sky), since these two favour all these creatures;--what\nclay (there is in the brick) that is this earth; and what water there is that\nis that sky; and the bricks consist of clay and water: therefore he may say,\n'Two.'\n\n6:1:2:3535\\. Or he may say, 'A cow (or bullock, go);--'the cow forsooth means\nthese worlds, for whatever walks (gam) that walks in these worlds 1; and that\n\np. 157\n\nfire also is these worlds: therefore he may say, 'A cow.'\n\n6:1:2:3636\\. As to this they say, 'For what object is this fire (altar) built?\nHaving become a bird, he (Agni) shall bear me to the sky!' so say some; but\nlet him not think so; for by assuming that form, the vital airs became Pra _g_\napati 1; by assuming that form, Pra _g_ apati created the gods 2; by assuming\nthat form, the gods became immortal and what thereby the vital airs, and Pra\n_g_ apati, and the gods became, that indeed he (the Sacrificer) thereby\nbecomes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[149:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_297) As here, this class of deities--whose sphere of\naction are the terrestrial regions--was associated with Agni, the guardian of\nthe earth, at III, 4, 2, 1.\n\n[149:2](sbe4129.htm#fr_298) Another class of (storm) deities, here associated\nwith Vayu, the wind, the guardian of the air-region.\n\n[149:3](sbe4129.htm#fr_299) This class of deities (of light) are here\nassociated with the p. 150 Sun, who indeed is called the \xc3\x82ditya in paragraphs\n[4](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:4) and [10](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:10) (instead of Surya).\n\n[150:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_300) Professor Weber (Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 268) has\ndrawn attention to the discrepancy between this passage and III, 4, 2, 1,\nwhere the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ (with B _ri_ haspati) are denied the privilege of\nforming a special class of deities,--this being one of many points of\ndifference, doctrinal as well as linguistic, between Books 1-5 and 6-10.\n\n[150:2](sbe4129.htm#fr_301) Professor Delbruck, Altind. Synt. p. 147, reads\n'apa _k_ anta,'--the plants matured fruit.\n\n[150:3](sbe4129.htm#fr_302) Literally, he fell asunder, or to pieces, became\ndisjointed. Hence, when the gods 'restored' Pra _g_ apati (the lord of\ngeneration, identified with the sacrifice, and with Agni, the fire), the verb\nused is _s_ a _m_ sk _ri_ ; 'to put together;' and this putting together, or\nrestoration, of Pra _g_ apati is symbolically identified with the building up\nof the fire-altar.\n\n[151:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_303) Upa-dha. Paragraphs [14](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:14) and\n[15](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:15) involve a double meaning of the word hita, the past\nparticiple of dha, to put,--viz. put, set, or suitable, beneficial.\n\n[151:2](sbe4129.htm#fr_304) Or, 'I shall put on,' &c., upa-dha, the verb used\nof the putting on of bricks in building up the altar. Cf. II, 1, 2, 15.\n\n[152:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_305) That is, the four quarters, or cardinal points of\nthe compass; and the upper region, or rather the upward (or perpendicular)\ndirection.\n\n[153:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_306) In contradistinction to the ya _g_ ushmati\n(prayerful) bricks, which bear special names, and have special formulas\nattached to them; lokam-p _ri_ _n_ a (space-filling ones) is the technical\nterm for those bricks which have no special prayers belonging to them, but are\npiled up with a common formula (Va _g_. S. XII, 54; Sat. Br. VIII, 7, 2, 1\nseq.), beginning 'lokam p _ri_ _n_ a _kh_ idram p _ri_ na,' 'fill the space,\nfill the gap!'\n\n[154:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_307) This is the formula (Va _g_. S. XII, 53) with\nwhich the so-called 'sadanam' or 'settling' of the bricks is performed. See\n[VII, 1, 1, 30](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:30).\n\n[154:2](sbe4129.htm#fr_308) That is, the first brick which the wife of the\nSacrificer herself forms, and which is called Asha _dh_ a. See [VI, 3, 1,\n1](sbe4134.htm#6:3:1:1); [5, 3, 1](sbe4143.htm#6:5:3:1).\n\n[155:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_309) Viz. by means of the clay bricks, and the loose\nsoil put between the layers.\n\n[155:2](sbe4129.htm#fr_310) Saya _n_ a only refers here to the fact that the\nsacrifice (ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a) is called 'pa\xe1\xb9\x85kta,' 'the fivefold.'\n\n[155:3](sbe4129.htm#fr_311) See [VII, 5, 2, 1](sbe4166.htm#7:5:2:1) seq.\n\n[155:4](sbe4129.htm#fr_312) See [VII, 4, 1, 15](sbe4163.htm#7:4:1:15) seq.\n\n[155:5](sbe4129.htm#fr_313) See [VII, 4, 1, 32](sbe4163.htm#7:4:1:32) seq.\n\n[155:6](sbe4129.htm#fr_314) See [VII, 5, 1, 12](sbe4165.htm#7:5:1:12) seq.\n\n[155:7](sbe4129.htm#fr_315) See [VII, 5, 1, 1](sbe4165.htm#7:5:1:1) seq.\n\n[155:8](sbe4129.htm#fr_316) Apparently some kind of porous stone. Three such\nperforated stones or 'bricks' are used in the construction of the fire-altar;\nviz. one which is laid on the gold man in the centre of the bottom layer (a\nsaman relating to bhus, the earth, being pronounced p. 156 on it while\ntouching it); the second in the centre of the third layer; and the third one\nbeing laid upon the centre of the completed fifth layer. They are meant to\nrepresent the three worlds, the holes being intended to afford to the\nSacrificer (represented by the gold man) a passage to the highest regions. See\n[VI, 2, 3, 1](sbe4133.htm#6:2:3:1) seq.\n\n[156:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_317) It is not quite clear whether the author indulges\nin etymological trifling (go--gu). The Bombay MS. of Saya _n_ a reads,--ima\n_m_ stallokan ga _k_ _kh_ atiti kavana(?gavana)karmasadhana _m_ go _s_ abda\n_m_ dar _s_ ayati.\n\n[157:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_318) See [VI, 1, 1, 2](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:2) seq., where\nthe seven vital airs are represented as assuming the form of a bird--the\nPurusha Pra _g_ apati.\n\n[157:2](sbe4129.htm#fr_319) See paragraphs\n[7](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:7)-[11](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:11).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 1, 3.
