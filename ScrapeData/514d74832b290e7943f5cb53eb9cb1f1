IX.\n\nSports of the boys in the forest. Pralamba the Asura comes amongst them: is\ndestroyed by Rama, at the command of Krishn\xcc\x81a.\n\nWHEN the demon in the form of an ass, and all his tribe, had been destroyed,\nthe grove of palms became the favourite resort of the Gopas and their wives,\nand the sons of Vasudeva, greatly pleased, repaired to the Bhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ira fig\ntree. They continued to wander about, shouting and singing, and gathering\nfruits and flowers from the trees; now driving the cows afar to pasture; now\ncalling them by their names; now carrying the foot-ropes of the kine upon\ntheir shoulders; now ornamenting themselves with garlands of forest flowers,\nthey looked like two young bulls when the horns first appear. Attired the one\nin yellow, and the other in sable garments, they looked like two clouds, one\nwhite, and one black, surmounted by the bow of Indra. Sporting mutually with\nfrolics beneficial to the world, they roamed about like two monarchs over all\nthe collected sovereigns of the earth. Assuming human duties, and maintaining\nthe human character, they strayed through the thickets, amusing themselves\nwith sports suited to their mortal species and condition, in swinging on the\nboughs of trees, or in boxing and wrestling and hurling stones.\n\nHaving observed the two lads thus playing about, the Asura Pralamba, seeking\nto devour them, came amongst the cowherd boys in the shape of one of\nthemselves, and mixed, without being suspected, in their pastimes; for he\nthought, that, thus disguised, it would not be difficult to find an\nopportunity to kill, first Krishn\xcc\x81a, and afterwards the son of Rohin\xcc\x81i. The\nboys commenced playing at the game of leaping like deer, two and two together\n1. Govinda was matched with Sridaman, and\n\np. 519\n\n[paragraph continues] Balarama with Pralamba: the other boys were coupled with\none another, and went leaping away. Govinda beat his companion, and Balarama\nhis; and the boys who were on Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s side were also victorious. Carrying\none another, they reached the Bhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ira fig; and from thence those who were\nvictors were conveyed back to the starting-ground by those who were\nvanquished. It being Pralamba\'s duty to carry Sankarshana, the latter mounted\nupon his shoulders, like the moon riding above a dark cloud; and the demon ran\noff with him, but did not stop: finding himself, however, unable to bear the\nweight of Balarama, he enlarged his bulk, and looked like a black cloud in the\nrainy season, Balarama beholding him like a scorched mountain, his head\ncrowned with a diadem, and his neck hung round with garlands, having eyes as\nlarge as cart wheels, a fearful form, and shaking the earth with his tread,\ncalled out, as he was carried away, to his brother, "Krishn\xcc\x81a, Krishn\xcc\x81a, I am\ncarried off by some demon, disguised as a cowherd, and huge as a mountain!\nWhat shall I do? Tell me, Madhusudana: the villain runs away with speed!"\nKrishn\xcc\x81a opened his mouth, smiling, for he well knew the might of the son of\nRohin\xcc\x81i, and replied, "Why this subtle pretext of merely mortal nature? thou\nwho art the soul of all the most subtile of subtile things. Remember yourself,\nthe radical cause of the whole world; born before all cause, and all that is\nalone when the world is destroyed. Dost thou not know that you and I are alike\nthe origin of the world, who have come down to lighten its load? The heavens\nare thy head; the waters are thy body; earth is thy feet; thy mouth is eternal\nfire; the moon is thy mind; the wind thy breath; thy arms and hands are the\nfour regions of space. Thou hast, O mighty lord, a thousand heads, a thousand\nhands and feet and bodies; a thousand Brahmas spring from thee, who art before\nall, and whom the sages praise in myriads of forms. No one but I knoweth thy\ndivine person. Thy incarnate person is glorified by all the gods. Knowest thou\nnot, that, at the end of all, the universe disappears in thee? that, upheld by\nthee, this\n\np. 520\n\nearth sustains living and inanimate things? and that, in the character of\nuncreated time, with its divisions of ages, developed from an instant, thou\ndevourest the world? As the waters of the sea, when swallowed up by submarine\nflame, are recovered by the winds, and thrown, in the form of snow, upon the\nHimachala, where coming into contact with the rays of the sun, they reassume\ntheir watery nature 2; so the world, being devoured by thee at the period of\ndissolution, becomes of necessity, at the end of every Kalpa, the world again,\nthrough thy creative efforts. Thou and I, soul of the universe, are but one\nand the same cause of the creation of the earth, although, for its protection,\nwe exist in distinct individuals. Calling to memory who thou art, O being of\nillimitable might, destroy of thyself the demon. Suspending a while your\nmortal character, do what is right."\n\nThus reminded by the magnanimous Krishn\xcc\x81a, the powerful Baladeva laughed, and\nsqueezed Pralamba with his knees, striking him at the same time on the head\nand face with his fists, so as to beat out both his\n\np. 521\n\neyes. The demon, vomiting blood from his mouth, and having his brain forced\nthrough the skull, fell upon the ground, and expired. The Gopas, beholding\nPralamba slain, were astonished, and rejoiced, and cried out, "Well done," and\npraised Balarama: and thus commended by his playfellows, and accompanied by\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, Bala, after the death of the daitya Pralamba, returned to Gokula 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[518:1](vp126.htm#fr_1482) Jumping with both feet at once, as deer bound, two\nboys together: the one that holds out longest, or comes to a given point\nfirst, is the victor, and the vanquished p. 519 is then bound to carry him to\nthe goal, if not already attained, and back again to the starting-post, on his\nshoulders. The Bhagavata does not specify the game, but mentions that the\nvanquished carry the victors on their backs.\n\n[520:2](vp126.htm#fr_1483) This passage is read and explained differently in\ndifferent copies. In some it is, ###. And this is explained, \'The water of the\nocean, devoured by the fire called Vad\xcc\x81ava, becoming condensed, or in the form\nof dew or snow, is seized by the wind called Kastaka, from which the Vad\xcc\x81ava\nfire has departed, consisting of a pipe of the solar rays, and being placed in\nthe air, lies or is on the Himachala,\' &c. This is rather an awkward and\nconfused representation of the notion, and the other reading is somewhat\npreferable: it consists simply in substituting ### for ### that is, according\nto the commentary, \'The water devoured by the fire is thrown by the wind Ka,\nmade of a solar ray &c., on the Himachala, where it assumes the form of snow;\'\nand so on. However disfigured by inaccurate views of some of the instruments\nin operation, the physiology is in the main very correct, and indicates\naccurate observation of natural phenomena. The waters of the ocean, converted\ninto vapour by solar heat, are raised by the same influence into the air, and\nthence borne by the winds to the summits of lofty mountain ranges, where they\nare arrested by a diminished temperature, descend in the form of snow, and\nagain supply the streams that perpetually restore to the sea the treasures of\nwhich it is as perpetually plundered.\n\n[521:3](vp126.htm#fr_1484) According to the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba the gods themselves\npraised this proof of Rama\'s strength (bala), and hence he derived the name of\nBalarama.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter X](vp127.htm)\n\n'
