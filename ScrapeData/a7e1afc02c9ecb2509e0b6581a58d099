He chooses priests (for officiating at a sacrifice) with neither\ndeficient nor superfluous limbs, 'who on\n\np. 194\n\nthe mother's and on the father's side (&c.),' as it has been said above.\n\n2\\. Let him choose young men as officiating priests: thus (declare) some\n(teachers).\n\n3\\. He chooses first the Brahman, then the Hot _ri_ , then the Adhvaryu, then\nthe Udgat _ri_.\n\n4 4. Or all who officiate at the Ahina sacrifices and at those lasting one\nday.\n\n5 5. The Kaushitakinas prescribe the Sadasya as the seventeenth, saying, 'He\nis the looker-on at the performances.'\n\n6 6. This has been said in the two _Ri_ _k_ as, 'He whom the officiating\npriests, performing (the sacrifice) in many ways' (Rig-veda VIII, 58, I. 2).\n\n7 7. He chooses the Hot _ri_ first.\n\n8\\. With (the formula), 'Agni is my Hot _ri_ ; he is my Hot _ri_ ; I choose\nthee N.N. as my Hot _ri_ ' (he chooses) the Hot _ri_.\n\np. 195\n\n9\\. With (the formula), ' _K_ andramas (the moon) is my Brahman; he is my\nBrahman; I choose thee N.N. as my Brahman' (he chooses) the Brahman.\n\n10\\. With (the formula), '\xc3\x82ditya (the sun) is my Adhvaryu; (he is my Adhvaryu,\n&c.)'\xc2\x97the Adhvaryu.\n\n11\\. With (the formula), 'Par _g_ anya is my Udgat _ri_ ; (he is my Udgat _ri_\n, &c.)'\xc2\x97the Udgat _ri_.\n\n12 12. With (the formula), 'The waters are my reciters of what belongs to the\nHotrakas'\xc2\x97the Hotrakas.\n\n13 13-14. With (the formula), 'The rays are my _K_ amasadhvaryus'\xc2\x97the _K_\namasadhvaryus.\n\n14\\. With (the formula), 'The ether is my Sadasya'\xc2\x97the Sadasya.\n\n15\\. He whom he has chosen should murmur, 'A great thing thou hast told me;\nsplendour thou hast told me; fortune thou hast told me; glory thou hast told\nme; praise thou hast told me; success thou hast told me; enjoyment thou hast\ntold me; satiating thou hast told me; everything thou hast told me.'\n\n16\\. Having murmured (this formula), the Hot _ri_ declares his assent (in the\nwords), 'Agni is thy Hot _ri_ ; he is thy Hot _ri_ ; thy human Hot _ri_ am I.'\n\n17\\. ' _K_ andramas (the moon) is thy Brahman; he is thy Brahman (&c.)'\xc2\x97thus\nthe Brahman.\n\n18\\. In the same way the others according to the prescriptions (given above).\n\n19 19. And if (the priest who accepts the invitation)\n\np. 196\n\nis going to perform the sacrifice (for the inviting person, he should add),\n'May that bless me; may that enter upon me; may I thereby enjoy (bliss).'\n\n20 20. The functions of an officiating priest are not to be exercised, if\nabandoned (by another priest), or at an Ahina sacrifice with small sacrificial\nfee, or for a person that is sick, or suffering, or affected with consumption,\nor decried among the people in his village, or of despised extraction: for\nsuch persons (the functions of a Ritvi _g_ should not be exercised).\n\n21 21. He (who is chosen as a _Ri_ tvi _g_ ) should ask the Somapravaka, 'What\nsacrifice is it? Who are\n\np. 197\n\nthe priests officiating? What is the fee for the sacrifice?'\n\n22\\. If (all the conditions) are favourable, he should accept.\n\n23\\. Let (the officiating priests) eat no flesh nor have intercourse with a\nwife until the completion of the sacrifice.\n\n24\\. 'By this prayer, O Agni, increase' (Rig-veda I, 31, 18)\xc2\x97with (this verse)\nlet him offer (at the end of the sacrifice) an oblation of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya in (his\nown) Dakshi _n_ agni, and go away where he likes;\n\n25\\. In the same way one who has not set up the ( _S_ rauta) fires, in his\n(sacred) domestic fire with this _Ri_ _k_ , 'Forgive us, O Agni, this sin'\n(Rig-veda I, 31, 16).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[193:1](sbe29122.htm#fr_471) 23, 1. Comp. _S_ rauta-sutra IX, 3, 20; G _ri_\nhya-sutra I, 5, 1.\n\n[194:4](sbe29122.htm#fr_472) The Ahina sacrifices are those which last more\nthan one day, but not more than twelve days. (Indische Studien, IX, 373; X,\n355.) The priests officiating at such sacrifices are the sixteen stated in the\n_S_ rauta-sutra IV, 1, 6. 7. Those besides the sixteen, though they are chosen\n(saty api vara _n_ e) for taking part in the sacred performances, have not the\nrank of _ri_ tvi _g_ as (officiating priests); such are the Sadasya, the Samit\n_ri_ , and the _K_ amasadhvaryava _h_ (schol. _S_ rautas. loc. cit.). See Max\nMuller's History of A. S. L., pp. 450, 469 seq. As to the Sadasya, however,\nthere was some difference of opinion (see the next Sutra).\n\n[194:5](sbe29122.htm#fr_473) On the office of the Sadasya, see Indische\nStudien, X, 136, 144.\n\n[194:6](sbe29122.htm#fr_474) The two _Ri_ _k_ as quoted here belong to the\ntenth among the Valakhilya hymns, a hymn omitted in many of the Rig-veda MSS.\nThey give no special confirmation to the rules stated in our text, but contain\nonly a general allusion to the unity of the sacrifice, which the various\npriests perform in many various ways.\n\n[194:7](sbe29122.htm#fr_475) 'If the four (chief) priests have to be chosen,\nthe choosing of the Brahma _n_ a stands first in order (see above, Sutra 3);\nif all (the sixteen), then the choosing of the Hot _ri_ stands first in\norder.' Naraya _n_ a.\n\n[195:12](sbe29122.htm#fr_476) The twelve priests of the sixteen (see \xc2\xa7 4 note)\nwho do not stand at the head of one of the four categories. Those at the head\nare enumerated in the Sutras\n\n[195:13-14](sbe29122.htm#fr_477) 13, 14. See above, \xc2\xa7 4 note.\n\n[195:19](sbe29122.htm#fr_478) Priests who only perform the Agnyadheya for a\nperson, are, according to Naraya _n_ a's note on this Sutra, not considered as\np. 196 performing a sacrifice for him; consequently the formula given here is\nonly to be used by priests who are elected for a Soma sacrifice. Stenzler\ntranslates, 'So spricht er, wenn er das Opfer durch sie vollziehen lassen\nwill.' But this would be yakshyama _n_ a _h_ , not ya _g_ ayishyan.\n\n[196:20](sbe29122.htm#fr_479) The tradition takes ni _k_ adakshi _n_ asya as\nin apposition to ahinasya, and I have translated accordingly. But I cannot\nhelp thinking that the two words should be separated, so that we should have\nto translate, 'or at an Ahina, or for a person that gives small sacrificial\nfee.' Thus the Brahma _n_ a quoted by \xc3\x82pastamba (see the commentary on the Pa\n_\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avi _m_ _s_ a Brahma _n_ a, vol. i, p. 6, ed. Bibl. Indica) gives the\nfollowing questions which the Ritvi _g_ to be chosen should ask, 'Is it no\nAhina sacrifice? Is the Ritvi _g_ office not abandoned by others? Is the\nsacrificial fee plentiful?' It is a very singular fact, that on the one hand\nthe assistance of a number of _Ri_ tvi _g_ as was unanimously declared\nnecessary for the performance of an Ahina sacrifice, while on the other hand\nit was considered objectionable, at least among some of the Vedic schools, to\nofficiate at such a sacrifice. See Weber's Indische Studien, X, 150, 151.\n\nOn anude _s_ yabhi _s_ asta Naraya _n_ a says, sade _s_ inabhi _s_ astasyaivam\neke. anye tu _s_ raddhe pratishiddhasyety ahu _h_. It seems to me that anude\n_s_ ya (or rather anude _s_ ya?) in _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana- _S_ raut. V, 1, 10\n(Indische Studien, X, 147) means the same, though the commentary on that Sutra\nascribes a different meaning to that word.\n\n[196:21](sbe29122.htm#fr_480) The Somapravaka is the messenger who invites the\npriests on behalf of the sacrificer to officiate at his intended Soma\nsacrifice.
