For five days\nDrona held his own against the Pandavs, and some of the incidents of these\ndays, like the fall of Abhimanyu and the vengeance of Arjun, are among the\nmost stirring passages in the Epic. The description of the different standards\nof the Pandav and the Kuru warriors is also interesting. At last Drona slew\nhis ancient foe the king of the Panchalas, and was then slain by his son the\nprince of the Panchalas.\n\nThe Book is an abridgment of Book vii. of the original text.\n\n## I\n\n## SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN BHIMA AND SALYA\n\nMorning ushered in the battle; Pandav warriors heard with dread  \nDrona priest and proud preceptor now the Kuru forces led,\n\nAnd the foe-compelling Drona pledged his troth and solemn word,  \nHe would take Yudhishthir captive to Hastina\'s haughty lord!\n\nBut the ever faithful Arjun to his virtuous elder bowed,  \nAnd in clear and manful accents spake his warlike thoughts aloud:\n\n"Sacred is our great preceptor, sacred is _acharya\'s_ life,  \nArjun may not slay his teacher even in this mortal strife!\n\nSaving this, command, O monarch, Arjun\'s bow and warlike sword,  \nFor thy safety, honoured elder, Arjun stakes his plighted word,\n\nMatchless in the art of battle is our teacher fierce and dread,  \nBut he comes not to Yudhishthir save o\'er blood of Arjun shed!"\n\nMorning witnessed doughty Drona foremost in the battle\'s tide,  \nBut Yudhishthir\'s warlike chieftains compassed him on every side,\n\nForemost of the youthful chieftains came resistless Arjun\'s son,--  \nFather\'s blood and milk of mothers fired his deeds of valour done!\n\nAs the lion of the jungle drags the ox into his lair,  \nAbhimanyu from his chariot draggled Paurava by the hair,\n\nJayadratha king of Sindhu marked the faint and captive chief,  \nLeaping from his car of battle wrathful came to his relief,\n\nAbhimanyu left his captive, turned upon the mightier foe,  \nAnd with sword and hardened buckler gave and parried many a blow!\n\nRank to rank from both the forces cry of admiration rose,  \nStreaming men poured forth in wonder, watched the combat fierce and close,\n\nPiercing Abhimanyu\'s buckler Jayadratha sent his stroke,  \nBut the turned and twisted sword-blade snapping in the midway broke!\n\nWeaponless the king of Sindhu ran into his sheltering car,  \nSalya came unto his rescue from a battle-field afar,\n\nDauntless, on the new assailant Arjun\'s son his weapon drew,  \nInterposing \'twixt the fighters Bhima\'s self on Salya flow!\n\nStoutest wrestlers in the armies, fiercest fighters with the mace,  \nBhima and the stalwart Salya stood as rivals face to face,\n\nHempen fastening bound their maces and the wire of twisted gold,  \nWhirling bright in circling flashes, shook their staff the warriors bold!\n\nOft they struck, and sparks of red fire issued from the seasoned wood,  \nAnd like horned bulls infuriate Madra\'s king and Bhima stood,\n\nCloser still they came like tigers closing with their reddened paws,  \nOr like tuskers with their red tusks, eagles with their rending claws!\n\nLoud as INDRA\'S peals of thunder still their blows were echoed round  \nRank to rank the startled soldiers heard the oft-repeated sound,\n\nBut as strikes in vain the lightning on the solid mountain-rock,  \nBhima nor the fearless Salya fell or moved beneath the shook!\n\nCloser drew the watchful heroes and their clubs were wielded well,  \nTill by many blows belaboured both the fainting fighters fell,\n\nLike a drunkard dazed and reeling Bhima rose his staff to wield,  \nSenseless Salya, heavy-breathing, henchman carried from the field,\n\nWrithing like a wounded serpent, lifted from the field of war,  \nHe was carried by his soldiers to the shelter of his car!\n\nDrona still with matchless prowess strove to keep his plighted word,  \nSought to take Yudhishthir captive to Duryodhan, Kuru\'s lord,\n\nVainly then the twin-born brothers came to cross the conqueror\'s path,  \nMatsya\'s lord, Panchala\'s monarch, vainly faced him in his wrath,\n\nRank to rank the cry resounded circling o\'er the battle-field,  \nDrona takes Yudhishthir captive with his bow and sword and shield!"\n\nArjun heard the dreadful message and in haste and fury came,  \nStrove to save his king and elder and redeem his loyal fame,\n\nSpeeding with his milk-white coursers dashed into the thick of war,  \nBlew his shrill and dreaded _sankha_ , drove his sounding battle-car,\n\nFiercer, darker grew the battle, when above the reddened plain,  \nEvening drew her peaceful mantle o\'er the living and the slain!\n\n## II\n\n## STANDARDS OF THE PANDAVS\n\nMorning came; still round Yudhishthir Drona led the gathering war,  \nArjun fought the Sam-saptakas in the battle-field afar,\n\nBut the prince of fair Panchala marked his father\'s ancient foe,  \nAnd against the doughty Drona, Dhrishta-dyumna bent his bow!\n\nBut as darksome cloudy masses angry gusts of storm divide,  \nThrough the scattered fainting foemen Drona drove his car in pride,\n\nSteeds went down and riven chariots, young Panchala turned and fled,  \nOnward drove resistless Drona o\'er the dying and the dead!\n\nOne more prince of fair Panchala \'gainst the mighty Drona came,  \nAncient feud ran in the red blood of Panchala\'s chiefs of fame,\n\nFated youth! with reckless valour still he fought his father\'s foe,  \nFought and fell; relentless Drona laid the brave Satyajit low!\n\nSurging still like ocean\'s billows other Pandav warriors came,  \nTo protect their virtuous monarch and redeem their ancient fame,\n\nCame in various battle-chariots drawn by steeds of every hue,  \nVarious were the chieftains\' standards which the warring nations knew!\n\nBhima drove his stalwart horses tinted like the dappled deer,  \nGrey and pigeon-coloured coursers bore Panchala\'s prince and peer,\n\nHorses bred in famed Kamboja, dark and grey of deepest hue,  \nBrave Nakula\'s sumptuous chariot in the deathful battle drew,\n\nPiebald horses trained to battle did young Sahadeva rein,  \nIvory-white Yudhishthir\'s coursers with their flowing ebon mane,\n\nAnd by him with gold umbrella valiant monarch Drupad came,  \nHorses of a bright bay-colour carried Matsya\'s king of fame.\n\nVaried as their varied courses gallantly their standards rose,  \nWith their wondrous stran1ge devices, terror of their armed foes,\n\nWater-jar on tawny deerskin, such was Drona\'s sign of war,  \nDrona as a tender infant rested in a water-jar,\n\nGolden moon with stars surrounding was Yudhishthir\'s sign of yore,  \nSilver lion was the standard tiger-waisted Bhima bore,\n\nBrave Nakula\'s sign was red deer with its back of burnished gold,  \nSilver swan with bells resounding Sahadeva\'s onset told,\n\nGolden peacock rich-emblazoned was young Abhimanyu\'s joy,  \nVulture shone on Ghatotkacha, Bhima\'s proud and gallant boy.\n\nNow Duryodhan marked the foemen heaving like the rising tide,  \nAnd he faced the wrathful Bhima towering in his tameless pride,\n\nShort the war; for proud Duryodhan wounded from the battle fled,  \nAnd his warriors from fair Anga rested with the countless dead!\n\nWild with anger Bhagadatta, monarch of the farthest East,  \nWith his still unconquered forces on the valiant Bhima pressed,\n\nCame from far the wrathful Arjun and the battle\'s front he sought,  \nWhere by eastern foes surrounded still the stalwart Bhima fought!\n\nFated monarch from the mighty Brahma-putra\'s sounding shore,  \nLand of rising sun will hail him and his noble peers no more,\n\nFor his tusker pierced by arrows trumpeted his dying wail,  \nLike a red and flaming meteor gallant Bhagadatta fell!\n\nThen with rising wrath and anguish Karna\'s noble bosom bled,  \nKarna who had stayed from battle while his rival Bhishma led,\n\nAncient hate and jealous anger clouded Karna\'s warlike heart,  \nAnd while Bhishma led, all idly slumbered Karna\'s bow and dart,\n\nNow he marked with warrior\'s anguish all his comrades fled afar,  \nAnd his foeman Arjun sweeping o\'er the red field of the war!\n\nHatred like a tongue of red fire shot from Karna\'s flaming eye,  \nAnd he sprang to meet his foeman or to conquer or to die,\n\nFierce and dubious was the battle, answering clouds gave back the din,  \nKarna met his dearest foeman and, alas, his nearest kin!\n\nBhima and Panchala\'s warriors unto Arjun\'s rescue came,  \nProud Duryodhan came to Karna, and fair Sindhu\'s king of fame,\n\nFiercely raged the gory combat, when the night its shadows threw,  \nWounded men and blood-stained chieftains to their nightly tents withdrew\n\n## III\n\n## ABHIMANYU\'S DEATH\n\nFatal was the blood-red morning purpling o\'er the angry east,  \nFatal day for Abhimanyu, bravest warrior and the best,\n\nCountless were the gallant chieftains like the sands beside the sea,  \nNone with braver bosom battled, none with hands more stout and free!\n\nBrief, alas, thy radiant summers, fair Subhadra\'s gallant boy,  \nLoved of Matsya\'s soft-eyed princess and her young heart\'s pride and joy,\n\nBrief, alas, thy sunlit winters, light of war too early quenched,  \nPeerless son of peerless Arjun, in the blood of foemen drenched!\n\nDrona on that fatal morning ranged his dreadful battle-line  \nIn a circle darkly spreading where the chiefs with chiefs combine,\n\nAnd the Pandavs looked despairing on the battle\'s dread array,  \nVainly strove to force a passage, vainly sought their onward way!\n\nAbhimanyu, young and fiery, dashed alone into the war,  \nReckless through the shattered forces all resistless drove his car,\n\nElephants and crashing standards, neighing steeds and warriors slain  \nFell before the furious hero as he made a ghastly lane!\n\nProud Duryodhan rushed to battle, strove to stop the turning tide,  \nAnd his stoutest truest warriors fought by proud Duryodhan\'s side,\n\nOnward still went Abhimanyu, Kurus strove and fought in vain,  \nBackward reeled and fell Duryodhan and his bravest chiefs were slain!\n\nNext came Salya car-borne monarch \'gainst the young resistless foe,  \nUrged his fiery battle-coursers, stretched his death-compelling bow,\n\nOnward still went Abhimanyu, Salya strove and fought in vain,  \nAnd his warriors took him bleeding from the reddened battle-plain!\n\nNext Duhsasan darkly lowering thundered with his bended bow,  \nAbhimanyu smiled to see him, kinsman and the dearest foe,\n\n"Art thou he," said Abhimanyu, "known for cruel word and deed,  \nImpious in thy heart and purpose, base and ruthless in thy greed?\n\nDidst thou with the false Sakuni win a realm by low device,  \nWin his kingdom from Yudhishthir by ignoble trick of dice,\n\nDidst thou in the council chamber with your insults foul and keen  \nBy her flowing raven tresses drag Yudhishthir\'s stainless queen,\n\nDidst thou speak to warlike Bhima as thy serf and bounden slave,  \nWrong my father righteous Arjun, peerless prince and warrior brave?\n\nWelcome! have sought thee often, wished to cross thy tainted path,  \nWelcome! Dearest of all victims to my nursed and cherished wrath,\n\nReap the meed of sin and insult, draw on earth thy latest breath,  \nFor I owe to Queen Draupadi, impious prince, thy speedy death!"\n\nLike a snake upon an ant-hill, on Duhsasan\'s wicked heart  \nFell with hissing wrath and fury Abhimanyu\'s fiery dart,\n\nFrom the loss of blood Duhsasan fainted on his battle-car,  \nKuru chieftains bore him senseless from the blood-stained scene of war!\n\nNext in gleaming arms accoutred came Duryodhan\'s gallant son,  \nProud and warlike as his father, famed for deeds of valour done,\n\nYoung in years and rich in valour, for alas! he fought too well,  \nAnd before his weeping father proud and gallant Lakshman fell!\n\nOnward still went Abhimanyu midst the dying and the dead,  \nShook from rank to rank the Kurus and their shattered army fled,\n\nThen the impious Jayadratha, king of Sindhu\'s sounding shore,  \nCame forth in unrighteous concert with six car-borne warriors more,\n\nDarkly closed the fatal circle with the gulfing surge\'s moan,  \nDauntless with the seven brave chieftains Abhimanyu fought alone!\n\nFell, alas, his peacock standard and his car was broke in twain,  \nBow and sabre rent and shattered and his faithful driver slain,\n\nHeedless yet of death and danger, misty with the loss of blood,  \nAbhimanyu. wiped his forehead, gazed where dark his foemen stood!\n\nThen with wild despairing valour, flickering flame and closing life,  \nMace in hand the heedless warrior rushed to end the mortal strife,\n\nRushed upon his startled foemen, Abhimanyu fought and fell,  \nAnd his deeds to distant ages bards and wand\'ring minstrels tell!\n\nLike a tusker of the forest by surrounding hunters slain,  \nLike a wood-consuming wildfire quenched upon the distant plain,\n\nLike a mountain-shaking tempest spent in force and hushed and still,  \nLike the red resplendent day-god setting on the western hill,\n\nLike the moon serene and beauteous quenched in eclipse dark and pale,  \nLifeless slumbered Abhimanyu when the softened starlight fell!\n\nDone the day of death and slaughter, darkening shadows close around,  \nWearied warriors seek for shelter on the vast and tented ground,\n\nSoldiers\' camp-fires brightly blazing, tent-lights shining from afar,  \nCast their fitful gleam and radiance on the carnage of the war!\n\nArjun from a field at distance, where upon that day he fought,  \nWith the ever faithful Krishna now his nightly shelter sought,\n\nWherefore, Krishna," uttered Arjun, "evil omens strike my eye,  \nThoughts of sadness fill my bosom, wake the long-forgotten sigh,\n\nWherefore voice of evening bugle speaks not on the battle-field,  \nMerry conch nor sounding trumpet music to the warriors yield?\n\nHarp is hushed within the dark tents and the voice of warlike song,  \nBards beside the evening camp-fire tales of war do not prolong,\n\nGood Yudhishthir\'s tent is voiceless and my brothers look so pale,  \nAbhimanyu comes not joyous Krishna and his sire to hail,\n\nAbhimanyu\'s love and greeting bless like blessings from above,  \nFair Subhadra\'s joy and treasure, Arjun\'s pride and hope and love!"\n\nSoftly and with many tear-drops did the sad Yudhishthir tell,  \nHow in dreadful field of battle gallant Abhimanyu fell,\n\nHow the impious Jayadratha fell on Arjun\'s youthful son,--  \nHe with six proud Kuru chieftains,--Abhimanyu all alone,\n\nHow the young prince reft of weapon and deprived of steel and car,  \nFell as falls a Kshatra warrior fighting on the field of war!\n\nArjun heard; the father\'s bosom felt the cruel cureless wound,  \n"Brave and gallant boy!" he uttered as he sank upon the ground,\n\nMoments passed of voiceless sorrow and of speechless bitter tear,  \nSobs within his mailed bosom smote the weeping listener\'s ear!\n\nMoments passed; with rising anger quivered Arjun\'s iron frame,  \nAbhimanyu\'s cruel murder smote the father\'s heart to flame,\n\n"Didst thou say that Sindhu\'s monarch on my Abhimanyu bore,--  \nHe alone,--and Jayadratha leagued with six marauders more,\n\nDidst thou say the impious Kurus stooped unto this deed of shame,  \nOutrage on the laws of honour, stain upon a warrior\'s fame?\n\nFather\'s curse and warrior\'s hatred sting them to their dying breath,  \nFor they feared my boy in battle, hunted him to cruel death,\n\nHear my vow, benign Yudhishthir, hear me, Krishna righteous lord,  \nArjun\'s hand shall slay the slayer, Arjun plights his solemn word\n\nMay I never reach the bright sky where the righteous fathers dwell,  \nMay I with the darkest sinners live within the deepest hell--\n\nWith the men who slay their fathers, shed their loving mothers\' blood,  \nStain the sacred bed of gurus, steal their gold and holy food,\n\nCherish envy, cheat their kinsmen, speak the low and dastard lie,  \nIf, ere comes to-morrow\'s sunset, Jayadratha doth not die,\n\nJayadratha dies to-morrow, victim to my vengeful ire,  \nArjun else shall yield his weapons, perish on the flaming pyre!"\n\nSofter tear-drops wept the mother, joyless was Subhadra\'s life,--  \nKrishna\'s fair and honoured sister, Arjun\'s dear and loved wife:\n\n"Dost thou lie on field of battle smeared with dust and foeman\'s gore,  \nChild of light and love and sweetness whom thy hapless mother bore,\n\nSoft thine eye as budding lotus, sweet and gentle was thy face,  \nAre those soft eyes closed in slumber, faded in that peerless grace,\n\nAnd thy limbs so young and tender, on the bare earth do they lie,  \nWhere the hungry jackal prowleth and the vulture flutters nigh,\n\nGold and jewels graced thy bosom, gems bedecked thy lofty crest,  \nDoth the crimson mark of sabre decorate that manly breast?\n\nRend Subhadra\'s stony bosom with a mother\'s cureless grief,  \nLet her follow Abhimanyu and in death obtain relief,\n\nEarth to me is void and cheerless, joyless in my hearth and home,  \nDreary without Abhimanyu is this weary world to roam!\n\nAnd oh! cheerless is that young heart, Abhimanyu\'s princess-wife,  \nWhat can sad Subhadra offer to her joyless sunless life,\n\nClose our life in equal darkness, for our day on earth is done,  \nFor our love and light and treasure, Abhimanyu, he is gone!\n\nLong bewailed the anguished mother, fair Draupadi tore her hair,  \nMatsya\'s princess early widowed shed her young heart\'s blood in tear!\n\n## IV\n\n## STANDARDS OF THE KURUS: ARJUN\'S REVENGE\n\nMorning from the face of battle night\'s depending curtain drew,  \nLong and shrill his sounding sankha then the wrathful Arjun blew,\n\nKurus knew the vow of Arjun, heard the sankha\'s deathful blare,  \nAs it rose above the red field, thrilled the startled morning air,\n\n"Speed, my Krishna," out spake Arjun, as he held aloft his bow,  \n"For to-day my task is dreadful, cruel is my mighty vow!"\n\nFiery coursers urged by Krishna flew with lightning\'s rapid course,  \nDashing through the hostile warriors and the serried Kuru force,\n\nBrave Durmarsan faced the hero but he strove and fought in vain,  \nOnward thundered Arjun\'s chariot o\'er the dying and the slain,\n\nFierce Duhsasan with his tuskers rushed into the fine of war,  \nBut the tuskers broke in panic, onward still went Arjun\'s car!\n\nDrona then, the proud preceptor, Arjun\'s furious progress stayed,  \nTear-drops filled the eye of Arjun as these gentle words he said:\n\n"Pardon, father, if thy pupil shuns to-day thy offered war,  \n\'Gainst his Abhimanyu\'s slayer Arjun speeds his battle-car,\n\nNot against my great _acharya_ is my wrathful bow-string drawn,  \nNot against a loved father fights a loving duteous son!\n\nHeavy on this bleeding bosom sits the darkening load of woe,  \nAnd an injured father\'s vengeance seeks the slaughtered hero\'s foe,\n\nPardon then if sorrowing Arjun seeks a far and distant way,  \nMighty is the vow of Arjun, cruel is his task to-day!"\n\nPassing by the doughty Drona onward sped the fiery car,  \nThrough the broken line of warriors, through the shattered ranks of war,\n\nAngas and the brave Kalingas vainly crossed his wrathful way,  \nProud Avantis from the regions where fair Chambal\'s waters stray,\n\nFamed Avanti\'s fated princes vainly led their highland force,  \nFell beneath the wrath of Arjun, stayed nor stopped his onward course,\n\nOnward still with speed of lightning thundered Arjun\'s battle-car,  \nTo the spot where Jayadratha stood behind the ranks of war!\n\nNow the sun from highest zenith red and fiery radiance lent,  \nLong and weary was the passage, Arjun\'s foaming steeds were spent,\n\nArjun said the faithful Krishna, "arduous is thy cruel quest,  \nBut thy foaming coursers falter and they need a moment\'s rest,"\n\n"Be it so," brave Arjun answered, "from our chariot we alight,  \nRest awhile the weary horses, Krishna, I will watch the fight!"\n\nSpeaking thus the armed Arjun lightly leaped upon the lea,  \nStood on guard with bow and arrow by the green and shady tree,\n\nKrishna groomed the jaded horses, faint and feeble, red with gore,  \nWith a healing hand he tended wounds the bleeding coursers bore,\n\nWatered them beside a river by the zephyrs soft caressed,  \nGave unto them welcome fodder, gave unto them needful rest,\n\nThus refreshed, the noble coursers Krishna harnessed to the car,  \nAnd the gleaming fiery Arjun rushed once more to fatal war!\n\nCame on him the Kuru warriors, darksome wave succeeding wave,  \nStandards decked with strange devices, streaming banners rich and brave,\n\nForemost was the glorious standard of preceptor Drona\'s son,  \nLion\'s tail in golden brilliance on his battle-chariot shone,\n\nElephant\'s rope was Karna\'s ensign made of rich and burnished gold,  \nAnd a bull bedecked the standard of the bowman Kripa bold,\n\nPeacock made of precious metal, decked with jewels rich and rare,  \nVrishasena\'s noble standard shone aloft serene and fair,\n\nPloughshare of a golden lustre shining like the radiant flame,  \nSpoke the car of mighty Salya, Madra\'s king of warlike fame,\n\nFar and guarded well by chieftains shone the dazzling silver-boar,  \nEnsign proud of Jayadratha brought from Sindhu\'s sounding shore,\n\nOn the car of Somadatta shone a stake of sacrifice,  \nSilver-boar and golden parrots, these were Salwa\'s proud device,\n\nLast and brightest of the standards, on the prince Duryodhan\'s car,  \nLordly elephant in jewels proudly shone above the war!\n\nNine heroic Kuru chieftains, bravest warriors and the best,  \nLeagued they came to grapple Arjun and on faithful Krishna pressed,\n\nArjun swept like sweeping whirlwind all resistless in his force,  \nSought no foe and waged no combat, held his ever onward course,\n\nFor he sighted Jayadratha midst the circling chiefs of war,  \n\'Gainst that warrior, grim and silent, Arjun drove his furious car!\n\nNow the day-god rolled his chariot on the western clouds aflame,  \nKarna\'s self and five great chieftains round brave Jayadratha came,\n\nVainly strove the valiant Arjun struggling \'gainst the Kuru line,  \nCharged upon the peerless Karna as he marked the day\'s decline,\n\nKrishna then a prayer whispered; came a friendly sable cloud,  \nVeiled the red sun\'s dazzling brilliance in a dark and inky shroud!\n\nKarna deemed the closing darkness now proclaimed the close of strife,  \nFailing in his plighted promise Arjun must surrender life,\n\nAnd his comrade chiefs rejoicing slackened in their furious fight,  \nJayadratha hailed with gladness thickening shades of welcome night!\n\nIn that sad and fatal error did the Kuru chiefs combine,  \nArjun quick as bolt of lightning broke their all unguarded line,\n\nLike an onward sweeping wildfire shooting forth its lolling tongue,  \nOn the startled Jayadratha, Arjun in his fury flung!\n\nShort the strife; as angry falcon swoops upon its helpless prey,  \nArjun sped his vengeful arrow and his foeman lifeless lay,\n\nFriendly winds removed the dark cloud from the reddening western hill,  \nAnd the sun in crimson lustre cast its fiery radiance still!\n\nEre the evening\'s mantling darkness fell o\'er distant hill an d plain,  \nProud Duryodhan\'s many brothers were by vengeful Bhima slain,\n\nAnd Duryodhan stung by sorrow waged the still unceasing fight,  \nIn the thick and gathering darkness torches lit the gloom of night!\n\nKarna, furious in his anger for his Jayadratha slain,  \nAnd for brothers of Duryodhan sleeping lifeless on the plain,\n\n\'Gainst the gallant son of Bhima drove his deep resounding car,  \nAnd in gloom and midnight darkness waked the echoes of the war!\n\nBhima\'s son brave Ghatotkacha twice the steeds of Karna slew,  \nTwice the humbled steedless Karna from the dubious battle flew,\n\nCame again the fiery Karna, vengeance flamed within his heart,  \nLike the midnight\'s lurid lightning sped his fell and fatal dart,\n\nWoeful was the hour of darkness, luckless was the starry sway,  \nBhima\'s son in youth and valour lifeless on the red field lay!\n\nThen was closed the midnight battle, silent shone the starry light,  \nBhima knew nor rest nor slumber through the long and woeful night!\n\n## V\n\n## FALL OF DRONA\n\nEre the crimson morning glittered proud Duryodhan sad at heart,  \nTo the leader of the Kurus did his sorrows thus impart:\n\n"Sadly speeds the contest, Drona, on the battle\'s gory plain,  \nKuru chiefs are thinned and fallen and my brothers mostly slain,\n\nCan it be, O beat of Brahmans, peerless in the art of war,  \nCan it be that we shall falter while thou speed\'st the battle-car?\n\nPandu\'s sons are but thy pupils, Arjun meets thee not in fight,  \nNone can face the great _acharya_ in his wrath and warlike might,\n\nWherefore then in every battle are the Kuru chieftains slain,  \nWherefore lie my warlike brothers lifeless on the ghastly plain?\n\nIs it that the fates of battle \'gainst the Kuru house combine,  \nIs it that thy heart\'s affection unto Panda\'s sons incline?\n\nIf thy secret love and mercy still the sons of Pandu claim,  \nYield thy place to gallant Karna, Anga\'s prince of warlike fame!"\n\nAnswered Drona brief and wrathful: "Fair Gandhari\'s royal son,  \nReapest thou the gory harvest of thy sinful actions done,\n\nCast no blame in youth\'s presumption on a warrior\'s fleecy hair,  \nFaithful unto death is Drona to his promise plighted fair!\n\nAsk thyself, O prince Duryodhan, bound by battle\'s sacred laws,  \nWherefore fightest not with Arjun for thy house and for thy cause,\n\nAsk the dark and deep Sakuni, where is now his low device,  \nWherefore wields he not his weapon as he wields the loaded dice,\n\nAsk the chief who proudly boasted, archer Arjun he would slay,  \nHelmed Arjun sways the battle, whither now doth Karna stay?\n\nKnow the truth; the gallant Arjun hath no peer on earth below,  \nAnd no warrior breathes, Duryodhan, who can face thy helmed foe,\n\nDrona knows his sacred duty, and \'tis willed by Heaven on high,  \nArjun or preceptor Drona shall in this day\'s battle die!"\n\nNow the Sun in crimson splendour rolled his car of glistening gold,  \nSent his shafts of purple radiance on the plain and mountain bold,\n\nAnd from elephant and charger, from each bravely bannered car,  \nLighted mailed kings and chieftains and the leaders of the war,\n\nFaced the sun with hands conjoined and the sacred _mantra_ told,--  \nHymns by ancient _rishis_ chanted, sanctified by bards of old!\n\nWorship done, each silent warrior mounted on his car or steed,  \nOnward to the deathful contest did his gallant forces lead,\n\nIll it fared with Pandav forces, doughty Drona took the field,  \nPeer was none midst living warriors of the Brahman trained and skilled,\n\nArjun, faithful to his promise, his preceptor would not fight,  \nKing nor chief nor other archer dared to face his peerless might.\n\nBut old feud like potent poison fires the warrior\'s heart with strife,  \nSire to son still unforgotten. leaps the hate from death to life,\n\nWrathful princes of Panchala by their deathless hatred stung,  \nSaw their ancient foe in Drona and on him for vengeance sprung!\n\nDarkly thought the ancient warrior of the old relentless feud,  \nFiercely like a jungle-tiger fell upon the hostile brood,\n\nRoyal Drupad\'s valiant grandsons in their youth untimely slain,  \nVictims of a deathless discord, pressed the gory battle-plain!\n\nDrupad pale with grief and anger marked his gallant grandsons dead  \nAnd his army crushed and routed and his bravest chieftains fled,\n\nFilled with unforgotten hatred and with father\'s grief and pride,  \nRushed the king, and bold Virata charged by doughty Drupad\'s side!\n\nRose a cry of nameless terror o\'er the red and ghastly plain,  \nNoble Drupad, brave Virata, lay among the countless slain,\n\nBurning tears the proud Draupadi wept for noble father killed,  \nMaid and matron with their wailing fair Panchala\'s empire filled,\n\nMatsya\'s joyless widowed princess, for her fate was early crost,  \nWept with added tears and anguish for her father loved and lost!\n\nWaged the war with fearful slaughter, Drona onward urged his way,  \nFate alone and battle\'s chances changed the fortunes of the day,\n\nAswa-thaman son of Drona was a chief of peerless fame,  \nAnd an elephant of battle bore that chieftain\'s warlike name,\n\nAnd that proud and lordly tusker Bhima in his prowess slew,  \nRank to rank from friend to foeman then a garbled message flew:\n\n"Aswa-thaman son of Drona is by mighty Bhima slain,"  \nDrona heard that fatal message, bent his anguished head in pain!\n\n"Speak Yudhishthir, soul of virtue thus the proud preceptor cried,  \n"Thou in truth hast never faltered and thy lips have never lied,\n\nSpeak of valiant Aswa-thaman, Drona\'s hope and pride and joy,  \nHath he fallen in this battle, is he slain, my gallant boy,\n\nFeeble are the hands of Drona and his prowess quenched and gone,  \nFleecy are his ancient tresses and his earthly task is done!"\n\nSaid Yudhishthir thus in answer: "Tusker Aswa-thaman\'s dead,"  \nDrona heard but half the accents, feebly drooped his sinking head,\n\nThen the prince of fair Panchala swiftly drove across the plain,  \nMarked his father\'s cruel slayer, marked his noble father slain!\n\nDhrista-dyumna bent his weapon and his shaft was pointed well,  \nAnd the priest and proud preceptor, peerless Drona lifeless fell,\n\nAnd the fatal day was ended, Kurus fled in abject fear,  \nArjun for his ancient teacher dropped a silent filial tear!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book X: Fall of Karna](maha10.htm)\n\n'
