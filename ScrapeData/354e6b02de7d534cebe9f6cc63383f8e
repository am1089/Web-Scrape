Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! Wonderful is the story that has been now\nrecited by you. My ears are not satisfied. So tell me what happened\nafterwards.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n2-94. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! The Creator Brahma, blessing them,\ndeparted to His own abode. The Danava married Tulasi under the Gandharba\nmethod. The celestial drums sounded and the flowers were showered. In the\nbeautiful lovely house the Danavendra, remained in perfect enjoyment. Tulasi,\ntoo, being busy with fresh intercourses, became almost mad after them. The\nchaste Tulasi and S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a both became deeply immersed in the ocean of\nbliss in their sexual union and began to enjoy sixty-four sorts of amorous\nsports. In the S\xc2\x92astras on love affairs, all the connections of limbs with\nlimbs that are described, as the lover and the loved desire, they both enjoyed\nthose with perfect freedom and pleasure. The place was solitary; to add to it,\nthe scenery was grand and lovely; so nothing remained untasted of the several\ntastes of amorous pleasures. On the banks of the river, in flower-gardens,\nthey slept on the flower beds smeared with sandal-paste, and enjoyed the\namorous pleasures. Both were adorned with\n\n\n\np. 879\n\n\n\njewel ornaments; both were skilled in amorous practices; so no one desisted.\nThe chaste Tulasi out of her nimbleness due to young age, easily stole into\nthe heart of her husband. S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, too, a great expert in knowing\nother\xc2\x92s amorous sentiments, attracted the heart of Tulasi. Tulasi obliterated\nthe sandal marks from the breast of the King and the sign of tilak from his\nnose. The King also wiped away the dot of Sindur and Alaka (vermillion) marks\nfrom Tulasi\xc2\x92s forehead and put marks of nails on her round plump breasts.\nTulasi also hurt the King\xc2\x92s left side by her bracelets. Then the King bit the\nlips of Tulasi. Thus each one embraced the other, kissed each other and each\none began to champoo the thighs, legs, etc. When both of them thus spent their\ntime in amorous sports, they got up and began to dress themselves as they\ndesired. Tulasi smeared S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a\xc2\x92s nose with red sandal-paste mixed\nwith kumkum (saffron), smeared his body with sweet-scented sandal-paste,\noffered sweet-scented betels in his mouth, made him put on celestial garments\n(fireproof; brought from Fire) put unto his neck the wonderful garland of\nParijata flowers, destructive of disease and old age, invaluable jewel rings\non his hand and offering him excellent gems, rare in the three worlds, said\n:-- \xc2\x93O Lord! I am your maidservant\xc2\x94 and uttering this repeatedly bowed down to\nthe feet of her husband with devotion. She then got up and with smiling\ncountenance began to look on his face with a steadfast gaze. The king\nS\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a then attracted his dear Tulasi to his breast and took off the\nveil fully from her face and began to look on that, next moment he kissed on\nher cheek and lips and gave her a pair of garments brought from the Varu _n_\na\xc2\x92s house, a necklace of jewels, hard to get in the three worlds, the tinklets\nof Svaha, the wife of Ag _n_ i, the Keyura (armlets) of the Sun\xc2\x92s wife Chhaya,\nthe two earrings of Rohi _n_ i, the wife of the Moon, the finger rings of\nRati, the wife of Kamadeva, and the wonderfully beautiful conch, given by\nVis\xc2\x92va Karma, excellent bedding studded with pearls and jewels and various\nornaments; and when he gave her all these things, he smiled. The king then put\ngarlands on Tulasi\xc2\x92s braid of hair, nicely variegated Alakas on her cheek,\nthree crescent lines of sweet-scented sandal paste within the Alakas, dots of\nsaffron all around that, the brilliant Sindura mark looking like a flame, and\nred \xc3\x82lta on the feet and toes; he then placed those feet on his breast and\nutterred repeatedly :-- \xc2\x93I am your servant\xc2\x94 and then held her on his breast.\nThey then left the hermitage, in that state and began to travel in various\nplaces. In the Malaya mountain, in mountains after mountains, in solitary\nflower gardens, in the mountain caves, in beautiful sea-beaches, on the banks\nof the Pu _s_ pabhadra river, cool with\n\n\n\np. 880\n\n\n\nwatery breeze, in various rivers and riversides, in Vi _s_ pandana forest\nechoed with sweet songs of the birds of the vernal season. They then went from\nVi _s_ pandana forest to the Surasana forest, from the Surasana, forest to the\nNandana forest, from the Nandana forest to the nice Chandana forests, from\nChandana forest to Champaka, Ketaki; Madhavi Ku _nd_ a, Malati, and Kumuda and\nlotus forests; thence they went to the forest of desire gratifying trees\n(Kalpavrik _s_ a forest,) and Parijata trees. They then went to the solitary\nplace Kanchan, thence to the Kanchi (forest) they then went to the Ki\xc3\xb1jalaka\nforest, thence to the Kanchanakar (the gold mine), thence to Kanchuka and\nvarious other forests echoed with the sweet sounds of cuckoos. There, on beds\nstrewn with flowers and scented with sandal paste they both enjoyed each other\nto their hearts content and with great pleasure. But none of them, whether\nS\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a or Tulasi, got quenched with their thirst. Rather their\npassions were inflamed like the fire on which clarified butter is poured (in\nsacrifices). The King of the Danavas, then, brought Tulasi to his own kingdom\nand, there, in his own beautiful garden house, he incessantly enjoyed her.\nThus the powerful king of the Danavas passed away one Manvantara in the\nenjoyment of his kingdom. He spread his sway over the Devatas, Asuras,\nDanavas, Gandharbas, Kinnaras, and Rak _s_ asas. The Devas, dispossessed of\ntheir realms, wandered everywhere like beggars. At last they united in a body\nand went to the Brahma\xc2\x92s assembly and there they began to cry and then related\nthe whole history how the Danava S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a oppressed them. Hearing all\nthis, Brahma took them to S\xc2\x92ankara and informed Him of the whole history of\nthe case. When Mahadeva heard all this, He took them all to the highest place,\nVaiku _nt_ ha devoid of old age and death. Going towards the first entrance of\nNaraya _n_ a\xc2\x92s abode, they saw the gate-keepers watching the gate, taking\ntheir seats on jewel thrones. They all looked brilliant, clothed with the\nyellow garments, adorned with jewel ornaments, garlanded with forest flowers,\nall of S\xc2\x92yama Sundara (dark blue, very beautiful) bodies. They were four-\narmed, holding on their hands, conch, mace, discus and lotus; sweet smile was\non their faces and eyes beautiful like lotus leaves. On Brahma asking them for\nentrance to the assembly, they nodded their assent. He, then, accompanied by\nthe Devas, passed one by one, sixteen gates and at last came before Naraya _n_\na. On reaching there, He saw that the assembly was completely filled with\nDevar _s_ is, and four-armed Naraya _n_ like Pari _s_ adas (attendants),\ndecked with Kaustubba jewels. The sight of the Sabha (assembly) makes one\nthink that the Moon has just arisen, shedding effulgent rays all round. By the\nwill of S\xc2\x92ri Hari, excellent diamonds, invaluable gems and necklaces of gems\nand jewels were\n\n\n\np. 881\n\n\n\nplaced at various places. At other places rows of pearls were shedding their\nsplendour and brilliance like the garlands of gems and jewels. At others, the\nmirrors were placed in a circle; and at various other places, the endless\nwonderful artistic picture lines were drawn. Again at other places the jewels\ncalled Padmaragas were artistically arranged as if the lotuses were there\nspreading their lustrous beauty all around. At many other places rows of steps\nwere made of wonderful Syamantak jewels. All around the assembly, there were\nthe excellent pillars, built of Indranilam jewels. Over those pillars, sandal\nleaves strung on strings from to pillar to pillar, were suspended. Golden\njars, all brimful with water were located at various places. All around, the\ngarlands of Parijata flowers were seen. The hall was decorated with sweet\nscented sandal trees, red like saffron and musk. Sweet scents were being\nemitted all round. The Vidyadharis were dancing at places. The assembly hall\nmeasured one thousand Yojanas. Countless servants were engaged all over on\nvarious works. Brahma, S\xc2\x92ankara, and the other Gods saw there S\xc2\x92ri Hari seated\nin the centre on an invaluable jewel throne, as a Moon looks surrounded by\nstars. There were the crown on His head, the ear-rings on His ears; garlands\nmade of wild flowers were on his neck and His body was smeared all over with\nsandal paste and He was holding Kelipadma (a sort of lotus) in His hand. He\nwas seeing, with a smiling countenance, the dancing and music before Him. He\nwas full of peace, the Lord of Sarasvati. Laksmi was holding gently His lotus\nfeet and He was chewing the sweet scented betel offered by Her. Ganga also was\nfanning Him devotedly with a white Chamara and the others were singing hymns\nto Him with their heads bent low with devotion. Brahma and the other Gods all\nbowed down to Him; their bodies were all filled with Pulaka (excessive joy\ncausing hair stand on end); tears flowed from their eyes and their\n\nvoices were choked out of emotion. The creator Brahma, then, with clasped\nhands informed Him, with head bowed down, of the whole history of S\xc2\x92ankhachu\n_d_ a. Hearing this, the omniscient Hari, knowing the minds of all, smiled and\nspoke to Brahma all the interesting secrets :-- O Lotus born! I know all about\nS\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a. He was in his previous birth My great devotee, an energetic\nGopa. Now I speak to you the ancient history of Goloka; hear. This story about\nGoloka is sin destroying and highly meritorious. S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, in his\nprevious birth was the Gopa Sudama, My chief Pari _s_ ad (attendant). He has\nnow become a Danava on account of the dire curse pronounced by S\xc2\x92ri\n\nRadha. One day when I went from My abode, accompanied by Viraja Gopi, to the\nRasa Ma _nd_ ala, My beloved Radha, hearing this news from a maid servant,\ncame up at once with Her whole host of Sakhis\n\n\n\np. 882\n\n\n\nwrathful, to the Rasa Ma _nd_ alam (ball dance in Goloka) and, not being able\nto see Me, saw Viraja turned into a river, She thought that I had disappeared.\nSo She went back to Her own abode with Her Sakhis. But when I returned to the\nhouse with Sudama, Radha rebuked Me very much. I remained silent. But Sudama\ncould not bear and he rebuked Radha in My presence, a thing quite intolerable\nto Her dignity! On hearing this rebuke, Radha\xc2\x92s eyes became red with anger and\nShe immediately ordered Her Sakhis to drive him away. Sudama began to tremble\nwith fear. Immediately on Her command lakhs and lakhs of Sakhis got up\nimmediately and drove that hot irresistible Sudama away. Sudama repeated his\nchafings and roarings. On hearing these, She cursed him :-- \xc2\x93You better be\nborn in the womb of a Danavi.\xc2\x94 Hearing the terrible curse, Sudama bowed down\nto Me and went away crying; then Radha, who was all-mercy, became melted with\nmercy. And She prevented him repeatedly, not to go away. Radha wept and told\nhim, \xc2\x93O Child! Wait. Where are you going? No more you will have to go;\nreturn.\xc2\x94 Thus saying She became very distressed. The Gopas and Gopis also\nbegan to weep. I then explained to them, \xc2\x93In about half a moment Sudama will\ncome back, fulfilling the conditions of the curse. O Sudama! Come here when\nthe curse expires.\xc2\x94 Then he appeased Radha also. \xc2\x93Know that one moment (K _s_\na _n_ ) in Goloka is equal to one Manvantara on earth. The Yogi S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_\na, expert in Maya and very powerful will soon return from the earth. Take this\nMy weapon S\xc2\x92ula and go early to Bharata. S\xc2\x92iva will slay the Danava by this\nS\xc2\x92ulastra. The Danava holds always on his neck My auspicious Kavacha and will\ntherefore become the conqueror of the universe. No one will he able to kill\nhim as long as be holds the above Kavacha. So, first of all, I will go to him\nin the form of a Brahma _n_ a and ask from him the Kavacha. O Creator! Thou\nalso didst give him the boon that his death would occur when the chastity of\nof his wife would be destroyed. I will go and hold intercourse with his wife.\nThen his death will occur without fail. His wife after her death will come and\nbecome My dearest wife. Thus saying, Naraya _n_ a gave over to Mahadeva the\nS\xc2\x92ulastra. Then He went gladly to His inner compartments. On the other hand,\nBrahma and Rudra and the other Devas incarnated themselves in Bharata.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Nineteenth Chapter on the going of the Devas to Vaiku _nt_ ha\nafter Tulasi\xc2\x92s marriage with S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad\nDevi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 20](bk09ch20.htm)\n\n'
