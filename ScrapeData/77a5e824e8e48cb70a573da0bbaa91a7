O fierce and brave,  \nGo forth, our threatened Lanka' save.  \nGo forth, a dreadful vengeance take:  \nFor this, O chief, I bade thee wake.  \nThe Gods and trembling fiends have felt  \nThe furious blows thine arm has dealt.  \nEarth has no warrior, heaven has none  \nTo match thy might, Paulastya's eon,'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXIII.: Kumbhakabna's Boast.](ry459.htm)\n\n"
