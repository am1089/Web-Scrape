UP\xc3\x82 _M_ _S_ U-GRAHA.\n\n3:9:4:11\\. Thereupon they sit down round the two press-boards 1. He (the\nAdhvaryu) then ties a piece of gold to that (nameless finger). For twofold,\nverily, is this; there is no third, namely, the truth and the untruth; the\ngods, forsooth, are the truth, and men are the untruth. And the gold has\nsprung from Agni's seed: 'With the truth I will touch the stalks, with the\ntruth I will take hold of Soma,' thus he thinks, and therefore he ties a piece\nof gold to that (ring-finger).\n\n3:9:4:22\\. He then takes a press-stone 2. Now those\n\np. 239\n\npress-stones are of rock, and Soma is a god--for Soma was in the sky, Soma was\nV _ri_ tra; those mountains, those rocks are his body--he thus perfects him by\nmeans of his body, makes him whole; therefore they are of rock. Moreover, in\npressing him they slay him, they slay him by means of that (stone, Soma's own\nbody); thus he rises from thence, thus he lives; therefore the press-stones\nare of rock.\n\n3:9:4:33\\. He takes it with (Va _g_. S. VI, 30), 'At the impulse of the divine\nSavit _ri_ I take thee with the arms of the A _s_ vins, with the hands of\nPushan; thou art a giver!' For Savit _ri_ is the impeller of the gods; thus he\ntakes it, impelled by Savit _ri_. 'With the arms of the A _s_ vins,' he says,\n--the A _s_ vins are the Adhvaryus (of the gods): with their arms he thus\ntakes it, not with his own. 'With the hands of Pushan,' he says,--Pushan is\nthe distributor of portions: with his hands he thus takes it, not with his\nown. Moreover, that (stone) is a thunderbolt, and no man can hold it: by means\nof those deities he takes it.\n\n3:9:4:44\\. 'I take thee: thou art a giver,' he says; for when they press him\nby means of that (stone), then there is an oblation; and when he offers an\noblation, then he gives sacrificial gifts,--thus, then, that (stone) gives\ntwofold, oblations and sacrificial gifts; wherefore he says, 'Thou art a\ngiver.'\n\n3:9:4:55\\. 'Perform thou this deep cult!' Cult means sacrifice; he thereby\nmeans to say, 'Perform thou this great sacrifice!'--'well-gotten for Indra;'\nby 'well-gotten' he means to say, 'well-produced;' and Indra is the deity of\nthe sacrifice, wherefore he says, 'for Indra;'--'by the most excellent bolt,'\n\np. 240\n\nfor he, Soma, is indeed the most excellent bolt 1, therefore he says, 'by the\nmost excellent bolt;'--'the (cult) rich in food and sweetness and drink,'\nwhereby he means to say, 'the (cult) rich in sap.'\n\n3:9:4:66\\. Thereupon he restrains-speech. For once on a time, the gods, while\nperforming sacrifice, were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They\nsaid, 'Let us sacrifice in a low voice, let us restrain speech!' They\nsacrificed (with formulas muttered) in a low voice and restrained speech.\n\n3:9:4:77\\. He then fetches the Nigrabhyas (waters), and makes him (the\nsacrificer) mutter over them 2, 'Ye are the Nigrabhyas, heard by the gods;\nsatisfy me, satisfy my mind, satisfy my speech, satisfy my breath, satisfy\nmine eye, satisfy mine ear, satisfy my soul, satisfy mine offspring, satisfy\nmy flocks, satisfy my followers, let not my followers thirst!' For water is\nsap, and over it he invokes this blessing, 'Satisfy ye my whole self, satisfy\nmy offspring, satisfy my followers, let not my followers thirst!' Now that Upa\n_m_ _s_ usavana (stone), forsooth, is in reality \xc3\x82ditya Vivasvant (the sun),\nit is the pervading vital air (vyana) of this (sacrifice).\n\n3:9:4:88\\. Thereon he metes out (the Soma). For in pressing him they slay him,\nthey slay him by means of that (stone); thus 3 he rises from hence, thus he\n\np. 241\n\nlives. And because he metes him out, therefore there is a measure,--both the\nmeasure among men 1, and what other measure there is.\n\n3:9:4:99\\. He metes out with (Va _g_. S. VI, 32), 'Thee for Indra, with the\nVasus, with the Rudras!' For Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he\nsays, 'Thee for Indra;' and by saying 'with the Vasus, with the Rudras,' he\nassigns a share, along with (or after) Indra, to the Vasus and the\nRudras.--'Thee for Indra, with the \xc3\x82dityas!' whereby he assigns a share to the\n\xc3\x82dityas along with Indra.--'Thee for Indra, the slayer of foes!' a foe is an\nenemy: 'Thee for Indra, the slayer of enemies,' he means to say. This is his\n(Indra's) special share: as there is a special share for a chief, so is this\nhis special share apart from the (other) gods.\n\n3:9:4:1010\\. 'Thee for the Soma-bearing falcon!' this he metes out for\nGayatri.--'Thee for Agni, the bestower of growth of wealth!' Now Agni is\nGayatri: he metes this out for Gayatri. And since Gayatri, as a falcon,\nfetched Soma from heaven, therefore she is (called) the Soma-bearing falcon:\nfor that prowess of hers he metes out (for her) a second portion.\n\n3:9:4:1111\\. Now as to why he metes out five times 2,--the sacrifice is of the\nsame measure as the year, and there are five seasons in the year: he takes\npossession of it in five (divisions); hence he metes out five times.\n\np. 242\n\n3:9:4:1212\\. He touches it with (Va _g_. S. VI, 33), 'What light of thine\nthere is in the heavens, O Soma, what on earth, and what in the wide air,\ntherewith make wide room for this sacrificer, for his prosperity: speak thou\nfor the giver!' Now when he (Soma) first became sacrificial food for the gods,\nhe thought within himself, 'I must not become sacrificial food for the gods\nwith my whole self!' Accordingly he deposited those three bodies of his in\nthese worlds.\n\n3:9:4:1313\\. The gods then were victorious. They obtained those bodies by\nmeans of this same (formula), and he became entirely the sacrificial food of\nthe gods. And in like manner does this (priest) now thereby obtain those\nbodies of his, and he (Soma) becomes entirely the food of the gods: this is\nwhy he thus touches it.\n\n3:9:4:1414\\. He then pours Nigrabhya water on it. Now the waters, forsooth,\nslew V _ri_ tra and by virtue of that prowess of theirs they now flow.\nWherefore nothing whatsoever can check them when they flow; for they followed\ntheir own free will, thinking, 'To whom, forsooth, should we submit (or stop),\nwe by whom V _ri_ tra was slain!' Now all this (universe), whatsoever there\nis, had submitted 1 to Indra, even he that blows yonder.\n\n3:9:4:1515\\. Indra spake, 'Verily, all this (universe), whatsoever there is,\nhas submitted unto me: submit ye also to me!'--They said, 'What shall be our\n(reward) then?'--'The first draught of king Soma shall be yours!'--'So be it!'\nthus they submitted to\n\np. 243\n\nhim; and they having submitted, he drew (ni-grabh) them to his breast; and\nbecause he thus drew them to his breast, therefore they are called Nigrabhyas.\nAnd in like manner does this sacrificer now draw them to his breast: and this\nis their first draught of king Soma, in that he pours Nigrabhya water thereon.\n\n3:9:4:1616\\. He pours it with (Va _g_. S. VI, 34), 'Ye are grateful, the\nsubduers of V _ri_ tra;'--the waters indeed are propitious: therefore he says,\n'Ye are grateful;' and 'the subduers of V _ri_ tra' he says because they did\nslay V _ri_ tra;--'the beneficent wives of the immortal (Soma);' for the\nwaters are immortal;--'Ye goddesses, lead this sacrifice to the gods!' there\nis nothing obscure in this; 'Invited, drink ye of Soma!' Thus invited they\ndrink the first draught of king Soma.\n\n3:9:4:1717\\. Being about to beat (the Soma with the pressing-stone), let him\nthink in his mind of him he hates: 'Herewith I strike N.N., not thee!' Now\nwhosoever kills a human Brahman here, he, forsooth, is deemed guilty 1,--how\nmuch more so he who strikes him (Soma), for Soma is a god. But they do kill\nhim when they press him;--they kill him with that (stone): thus he rises from\nthence, thus he lives; and thus no guilt is incurred.. But if he hate no one,\nhe may even think of a straw, and thus no guilt is incurred.\n\n3:9:4:1818\\. He beats with (Va _g_. S. VI, 35), 'Fear not, tremble not!'\nwhereby he means to say, 'Be not afraid, do not tremble, it is N.N. I strike,\nnot thee!'--'Take thou strength!' whereby he means to say, 'Take sap!'--'Both\nye bowls, that are\n\np. 244\n\nfirm, remain firm, take strength!'--'Surely, it is those two (pressing-)boards\nthat are thereby meant,' so say some;--what, then, if one were to break those\ntwo boards 1? But, forsooth, it is these two, heaven and earth, that tremble\nfor fear of that raised thunderbolt (the stone): hereby now he propitiates it\nfor those two, heaven and earth; and thus propitiated it does not injure them.\nBy 'Take strength!' he means to say, 'Take sap!'--'The evil is slain, not\nSoma!' he thereby slays every evil of his.\n\n3:9:4:1919\\. Thrice he presses 2, thrice he gathers together,\n\np. 245\n\nfour times he performs the Nigrabha,--this makes ten, for of ten syllables\nconsists the vira _g_ , and Soma is of vira _g_ nature: therefore he completes\n(the ceremony) in ten times.\n\n3:9:4:2020\\. Then as to why he performs the Nigrabha. Now when he (Soma) first\nbecame sacrificial food for the gods, he set his heart on those (four)\nregions, thinking, 'Could I but consort with those regions as my mate, my\nloved resort!' By performing the Nigrabha, the gods then made him consort with\nthe regions as his mate, his loved resort; and in like manner does this\n(sacrificer) now, by performing the Nigrabha, make him (Soma) consort with\nthose regions as his mate, his loved resort.\n\n3:9:4:2121\\. He performs with (Va _g_. S. VI, 36), 'From east, from west, from\nnorth, from south--from every side may the regions resort to thee!' whereby he\nmakes him consort with the regions as his mate, his loved resort. 'O mother,\nsatisfy (him)! may the noble meet together 1!' A mother\n\np. 246\n\n[paragraph continues] (amba) is a woman, and the regions (di _s_ , fem.) are\nwomen: therefore he says, 'O mother, satisfy (him)!--May the noble meet\ntogether!' The noble doubtless means people (creatures, offspring): he thus\nmeans to say, 'May the people live in harmony with each other!' Even the\npeople that are far away (from each other) live in harmony with each other:\ntherefore he says, 'May the noble meet together.'\n\n3:9:4:2222\\. Now as to why he is called Soma. When he first became sacrificial\nfood for the gods, he thought within him, 'I must not become, sacrificial food\nfor the gods with my whole self!' That form of his which was most pleasing he\naccordingly put aside. Thereupon the gods were victorious; they said, 'Draw\nthat unto thee, for therewith shalt thou become our food!' He drew it to him\neven from afar, saying, verily, that is mine own (sva me): hence he was called\nSoma.\n\n3:9:4:2323\\. Then as to why he is called Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a (sacrifice). Now, when\nthey press him, they slay him; and when they spread him 1, they cause him to\nbe born. He is born in being spread along, he is born moving (yan gayate):\nhence yan- _g_ a, for 'ya _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a' they say, is the same as 'ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a.'\n\n3:9:4:2424\\. Also this speech did he then utter (Va _g_. S. VI, 37;\n\np. 247\n\n[paragraph continues] Rig-veda I, 84, 19), 'Verily thou, a god, shalt extol\nthe mortal, O most mighty! than thee there is no other giver of joy 1, O lord!\nunto thee do I speak this word, O Indra!' For it was indeed as a mortal that\nhe uttered this, 'Thou alone wilt produce (me) from here, no other but thee!'\n\n3:9:4:2525\\. And from the Nigrabhya water they draw the several grahas (cups\nor libations of Soma). For it was the waters that slew V _ri_ tra, and in\nvirtue of this prowess they flow; and it is from flowing water that he takes\nthe Vasativari water, and from the Vasativari the Nigrabhya water; and from\nthe Nigrabhya water the several grahas are drawn. In virtue of that prowess,\nthen, the grahas are drawn from the Hot _ri_ 's cup. Now the Hot _ri_ means\nthe _Ri_ k (fem.), a woman; and from woman creatures are born here on earth:\nhence he makes him (Soma) to be born from that woman, the _Ri_ k, the Hot _ri_\n; wherefore (he takes the grahas) from the Hot _ri_ 's cup.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[238:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_588) The Adhvaryu and sacrificer sit north of them,\nlooking towards the south; and the assistants of the former--viz. the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ ; Nesh _t_ _ri_ , and Unnet _ri_ \\--on the south side,\nlooking northwards. The press-boards were laid down on the 'sound-holes,'\nunder the fore-part of the southern Soma-cart, and the pressing-skin was\nspread over them; see [III, 5, 4,\n22](sbe2622.htm#3:5:4:22)-[23](sbe2622.htm#3:5:4:23). The Udgat _ri_ s, or\nchanters, are seated behind the carts.\n\n[238:2](sbe2639.htm#fr_589) Viz. the upa _m_ _s_ usavana, or 'low-voiced\npressing (stone),' (see paragraph [6](sbe2639.htm#3:9:4:6),) with which the\nSoma for the Upa _m_ _s_ u libation (or cup, graha) is pressed.\n\n[240:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_590) It is doubtful what 'pavi' may mean here. It seems\nto mean originally a metallic mounting, especially of a shaft. The\ncommentators explain it by 'thunderbolt.'\n\n[240:2](sbe2639.htm#fr_591) The sacrificer holds the Hot _ri_ 's cup with the\nNigrabhya _h_ to his breast.\n\n[240:3](sbe2639.htm#fr_592) Viz. by being placed upon the stone. which is\nidentical with the sun (?); but cf. [III, 8, 2, 27](sbe2632.htm#3:8:2:27).\n\n[241:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_593) Tasmad v iya _m_ manushyeshu matra yat kaush _th_\no yat kumbhi yeya _m_ ka _k_ a manushyeshu matra. Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[241:2](sbe2639.htm#fr_594) According to Taitt. S. VI, 4, 4 he metes out five\ntimes with the above texts, and five times silently.\n\n[242:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_595) The Ka _n_ va MS. has twice 'tatsthana,' as Ait.\nBr. VI, 5, and twice 'tasthana;' cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 295.\n\n[243:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_596) 'Pari _k_ akshate' ought rather to mean 'they\ndespise him.'\n\n[244:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_597) That is to say, in that case the formula would\nprove to have been a failure. According to the Taitt. Kalpas., quoted to\nTaitt. S. I, 4, 1 (p. 590), he presses the skin down upon the two press-boards\nwhile muttering this formula. The Ka _n_ va text argues somewhat differently,\n--ime evaitat phalake ahur iti haika ahus tad u kim adriyeta yad athaite\nbhidyeyatam eveme haiva dyavap _ri_ thivyav etasmad va _g_ rad udyatat sa _m_\nre _g_ ete,--'Some say those two boards are thereby meant; but who would care\nif they should get broken; for it is rather those two, heaven and earth,' &c.?\n\n[244:2](sbe2639.htm#fr_598) The pressing of the Upa _m_ _s_ u-graha--also\ncalled the 'small' pressing, distinguished from the 'great pressing'\n(mahabhishava) for the subsequent cups or libations (graha)--consists of three\nturns of eight, eleven, and twelve single beatings respectively. Before each\nturn Nigrabhya water is poured upon the Soma plants by the sacrificer from the\nHot _ri_ 's cup. After each turn of pressing the Adhvaryu throws the\ncompletely-pressed stalks into the cup, and when they have become thoroughly\nsoaked, he presses them out and takes them out again; this being the\n'gathering together' referred to above. At the same time he mutters the\nNigrabha formula ([paragraph 21](sbe2639.htm#3:9:4:21)); after which the\npressed-out juice, absorbed by the water, is poured into the Upa _m_ _s_ u\nvessel in the following manner. Before the pressing the Pratiprasthat _ri_ had\ntaken six Soma-stalks, and put two each between the fingers of his left hand.\nAfter each turn of pressing he takes the Upa _m_ _s_ u vessel with his right\nhand and holds one pair of the Soma-stalks over it (or, according to others,\nall six at the same time), through which (as through p. 245 a strainer) the\nAdhvaryu then pours the Soma-juice from the pressing-skin into the vessel.\nAfter the third turn the pressing-stone itself is put into the Hot _ri_ 's\ncup, either with or without the muttering of the Nigrabha formula. According\nto the commentary on Katy. IX, 4, 27, the Soma-juice is transferred from the\nskin to the Upa _m_ _s_ u cup, by the straining-cloth being made to imbibe the\njuice and then being pressed out so as to trickle down through the plants\nbetween the Pratiprasthat _ri_ 's fingers. The description given by Haug, Ait.\nBr., Transl. p. 489, is somewhat different.\n\n[245:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_599) The interpretation of this formula is very\ndoubtful. The author evidently takes 'ari _h_ ' as nom. plur. of 'ari' (=\narya); but it does not appear how he takes 'nishpara,' while Mahidhara\nexplains it by 'puraya (give him, Soma, his fill).' The St. Petersburg Dict.\nsuggests that 'nishpara' may mean 'come out!' and that 'ari _h_ ' seems to be\na nom. sing. here. I take the last part of the formula to mean, 'May he (Soma)\nwin (or, perhaps, join) the longing (waters)!' p. 246 some of the Nigrabhya\nwater being poured on the Soma at each turn of pressing; and small stalks of\nSoma being, besides, thrown into the Hot _ri_ 's cup containing that water. As\nto the first part of the formula, it may perhaps mean, 'Well, pour out (or,\npour forth, intrans.).' Professor Ludwig, Rig-veda IV, p. xvi, thinks that\n'nishpara' is a correction of the Taitt, reading 'nishvara,' which Saya _n_ a\ninterprets, 'O mother (Soma), come out (from the stalks, in the form of\njuice),' and according to the Sutra quoted by him, the sacrificer is at the\nsame time to think of the wife he loves.\n\n[246:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_600) That is, when they perform the Soma-sacrifice.\n\n[247:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_601) This is the traditional meaning (sukhayit _ri_ )\nassigned to mar _d_ ayit _ri_ (the merciful, comforter); but it is not quite\nclear how the author of the Brahma _n_ a interprets it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 1.
