Satyak\xc4\x81ma 2\n\nSatyak\xc4\x81ma J\xc4\x81b\xc4\x81la thus addressed his mother Jab\xc4\x81l\xc4\x81: "I would keep the term of\nBrahman-studentship, madame; of what family am I?"\n\nShe said to him: "I know not, child, of what family thou art. I got thee in my\nyouth, when I was much busied in doing service. I myself know not of what\nfamily thou art. But I am named Jab\xc4\x81l\xc4\x81, thou art named Satyak\xc4\x81ma; call thyself\nthen Satyak\xc4\x81ma J\xc4\x81b\xc4\x81la." 3\n\np. 85\n\nHe went to H\xc4\x81ridrumata Gautama and said: "I would keep the term of Brahman-\nstudentship with thee, sir; let me come to thee, sir."\n\nHe said to him: "Of what family art thou, beloved?"\n\n"I know not, sir," said he, "of what family I am. I asked my mother, and she\nanswered me saying, "I got thee in my youth, when I was much busied in doing\nservice; I myself know not of what family thou art; but I am named Jab\xc4\x81l\xc4\x81,\nthou art named Satyak\xc4\x81ma." So I am myself Satyak\xc4\x81ma J\xc4\x81b\xc4\x81la, sir."\n\nHe said to him: "None but a Brahman can speak out thus. Bring the faggots, 1\nbeloved. I will receive thee; thou hast not departed from truth."\n\nWhen he had received him, he set aside four hundred lean and feeble cows, and\nsaid: "Herd thou these, beloved." As he drove them forth, [Satyak\xc4\x81ma] said: "I\nwill not return but with a thousand." He stayed away some years; then when\nthey had grown to a thousand, a bull said to him, "Satyak\xc4\x81ma!" "Sir!" he\nanswered.\n\n"We have come to a thousand, beloved; take us to the master\'s homestead. I\nwill tell thee a quarter of Brahma."\n\np. 86\n\n"Tell me, sir."\n\nAnd he said to him: "The eastern region is a sixteenth, the western region a\nsixteenth, the southern region a sixteenth, the northern region a sixteenth.\nThis, beloved, is a quarter of Brahma, in four sixteenths, and called The\nBrilliant. He who with such knowledge worships this quarter of Brahma in four\nsixteenths as The Brilliant, becomes brilliant in this world; brilliant worlds\nhe wins who with such knowledge worships this quarter of Brahma in four\nsixteenths as The Brilliant. The Fire will tell thee a quarter."\n\nIn the morning he drove out the cows. When they came home at evening, he laid\na fire, closed in the cows, laid on fuel, and sat down facing the east\nwestward of the fire.\n\nThe Fire said to him, "Satyak\xc4\x81ma!" "Sir!" he answered.\n\n"I will tell thee a quarter of Brahma, beloved."\n\n"Tell me, sir."\n\nAnd he said to him: "The earth is a sixteenth, the sky a sixteenth, the heaven\na sixteenth, the ocean a sixteenth. This, beloved, is a quarter of Brahma, in\nfour sixteenths, and called The Boundless. He who with such knowledge worships\nthis quarter of Brahma in four sixteenths as The Boundless, becomes boundless\nin this world; boundless worlds he wins who with such knowledge worships this\nquarter of Brahma\n\np. 87\n\nin four sixteenths as The Boundless. The Swan will tell thee a quarter."\n\nIn the morning he drove out the cows. When they came home at evening, he laid\na fire, closed in the cows, laid on fuel, and sat down facing the east\nwestward of the fire. A swan flew towards him and said, "Satyak\xc4\x81ma!" "Sir!" he\nanswered.\n\n"I will tell thee a quarter of Brahma, beloved."\n\n"Tell me, sir."\n\nAnd he said to him: "Fire is a sixteenth, the sun a sixteenth, the moon a\nsixteenth, the lightning a sixteenth. This, beloved, is a quarter of Brahma,\nin four sixteenths, and called The Lustrous. He who with such knowledge\nworships this quarter of Brahma in four sixteenths as The Lustrous, becomes\nlustrous in this world; lustrous worlds he wins who with such knowledge\nworships this quarter of Brahma in four sixteenths as The Lustrous. The madgu-\nbird will tell thee a quarter."\n\nIn the morning he drove out the cows. When they came home at evening, he laid\na fire, closed in the cows, laid on fuel, and sat down facing the east\nwestward of the fire. A madgu-bird flew towards him and said, "Satyak\xc4\x81ma!"\n"Sir!" he answered.\n\n"I will tell thee a quarter of Brahma, beloved."\n\n"Tell me, sir."\n\nAnd he said to him: "The breath is a sixteenth,\n\np. 88\n\nthe eye a sixteenth, the ear a sixteenth, the mind a sixteenth. This, beloved,\nis a quarter of Brahma, in four sixteenths, and called The Spacious. He who\nwith such knowledge worships this quarter of Brahma in four sixteenths as The\nSpacious, becomes spacious in this world; spacious worlds he wins who with\nsuch knowledge worships this quarter of Brahma in four sixteenths as The\nSpacious."\n\nHe came to the master\'s homestead. The master said to him, "Satyak\xc4\x81ma!" "Sir!"\nhe answered.\n\n"Thou art bright, beloved, as one who knows Brahma. Who has taught thee?"\n\n"Other than men," he answered; "but prithee do thou tell it to me, sir. For I\nhave heard from men like thee, sir, that knowledge learned from a master is\nthe best guide."\n\nHe told him thereof; and naught of it was lost.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[84:1](brk39.htm#fr_44) The first five are wind, fire, sun, moon, and water,\nin the cosmos; the second five are breath, speech, eye, ear, and mind, in the\nmicrocosm. Wind and Breath are the final principles of being. He who knows\nhimself to be identical with Wind and Breath, and thus becomes himself the\nhighest principle, gathers to himself all the nourishing powers of nature.\nThese ten natural forces are typified by the four-throw in dice, which counts\nas ten, and by Vir\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad, which is both the name of a metre of ten syllables and a\nmythological figure symbolic of primitive matter.\n\n[84:2](brk40.htm#fr_45) Chh\xc4\x81ndogya Upanishad, iv. 4-9.\n\n[84:3](brk40.htm#fr_46) In default of a father\'s name, that of his mother is\nto serve our hero to form his patronymic.\n\n[85:1](brk40.htm#fr_47) Used in the ceremony of the reception _(upanayana)_ of\nthe Brahman-student _(brahma-ch \xc4\x81r\xc4\xab)_ by the teacher in whose house he was\nhenceforth to lodge.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII: Light and Darkness](brk41.htm)\n\n'
