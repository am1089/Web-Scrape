[231](sbe3350.htm#page_231), Appendix v. 56. This difficult text, together\nwith an additional text, is quoted in a somewhat different, but equally faulty\nform, in the recently published last fasciculus of the Vivadaratnakara in the\nBibliotheca Indica. I propose to render the two texts as follows: 'Fines\nbeginning with a Karshapa _n_ a may amount to four Karshapa _n_ as at most (in\nheavy cases); there are others beginning with two and rising to eight, or\nbeginning with three and rising to twelve Karshapa _n_ as. All those (fines)\nwhich have been declared to begin with one Karshapa _n_ a may be raised to the\nfourfold amount; the same rule applies to the other fines as well, excepting\nthe highest fine (which consists of 2500 Pa _n_ as).'\n\nP. [369](sbe3382.htm#page_369), _after_ v. 14, _add_ '15. A wife should be\nhonoured by her husband with (presents of) clothes, ornaments, and food; and\nat a festival (she should receive similar presents) from her father and\nbrothers, her parents-in-law, and other relations.'\n\nP.
