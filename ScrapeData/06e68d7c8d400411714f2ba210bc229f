THE BANDHAS\xc2\x97MYSTIC BREATHING EXERCISES\n\nAmong the "secret" aspects of Yoga are the Bandhas, which may be translated\nroughly as breathing exercises. After the body has been prepared by thorough\npractice in the different _asanas_ and clarified by the breathing exercises,\nthe Yogi is ready for the Bandhas. These may not be attained immediately,\nsince they depend on a full state of body and mental relaxation for successful\nattainment.\n\n#### Uddiana Bandha\n\nBy a very strong expiration, the lungs are emptied and driven against the\nupper part of the thorax, carrying the diaphragm along with them. The\nintestines are thereby taken up to fill the empty space, and the stomach is\nmade so slender that it might be encompassed by the span of a hand.\n\n#### Jalandhara Bandha\n\nContract your throat and press your chin firmly against your breast about four\ninches from the heart.\n\np. 68\n\n#### The "Secret" Mudras\n\nThe ancient Sanskrit tract, the _Hatha Yoga Pradipika_ of Swatmaram Swami,\ndescribes the ten _mudras_ which bring great powers to advanced students of\nYoga. While these are described as being sought after as the goal of Yoga,\nthey are seldom achieved. According to the tract: "They are much sought after\nby all Siddhas (possessors of Yogic power) and are difficult to obtain even by\nthe Devas (lesser gods)." However, they may be of interest to the Western\nreader who seeks relaxation through Yoga. While practice of the Secret Mudras\nmay not result in the attainment of the ultimate goals described, it may prove\nbeneficial as another outlet for tension.\n\nAccording to Hindu sages, the ten _mudras_ destroy old age and death, having\nbeen given out by the god Siva, and also confer the eight _siddhis_ or\nmiraculous powers. The old text enjoins the student to secrecy, saying, "This\nshould be carefully kept secret as a box of diamonds and should not be told to\nanybody\xc2\x97just as the illicit connection with a married woman of noble family."\nDescriptions of the ten _mudras_ follow.\n\n#### Maha Mudra\n\nPressing the anus with the left heel and stretching the left leg, take hold of\nthe toes with your hand. Then practice the Jalandhara Bandha (described\nabove), and draw your breath through the _susumna_ (the space behind the\nnavel). Then the _kundalini_ (the sleeping goddess within the internal organs)\nbecomes straight, just as a coiled snake does when struck, and the _ida_ (left\nnostril) and _pingala_ (right nostril)\n\np. 69\n\nbecome dead, because the breath goes out of them. Then the breath should be\nlet out slowly, never quickly.\n\n#### Maha Bandha\n\nHaving restrained your breath as long as possible, breathe out slowly.\nPractice first on the left side, then on the right. This is said to stop the\nupward course of the breath through the _nadis_ (nerves) except _susumna_\n(spinal cord), bring about the union of them with the _susumna_ and enable the\nmind to remain fixed between the two eyebrows. The above two _mudras_ are\ndescribed as having limited value without a third, called the Maha Vedha.\n\n#### Maha Vedha\n\nDraw in your breath with a concentrated mind and stop the upward and downward\ncourse of breath by the Jalandhara Bandha. Sitting on the ground with your\nbody on your hands, gently seat and raise yourself repeatedly. Then breathe\nout. The body assumes a deathlike aspect in this exercise.\n\n#### Kechari Mudra\n\nThis is not likely to appeal to the Westerner seeking beneficial aspects of\nYoga. This _mudra_ requires the following preparation: By slight daily\ncutting, continued for six months, the ligament which holds down the tongue is\nsevered. By repeated pulling, the tongue is made long enough to reach the\neyebrows. The _mudra_ is performed by turning the tongue up and in, so that it\nenters the hole in the palate where the three _nadis_ (nerves) join.\nSimultaneously, the eyes should be fixed firmly between the brows.\n\np. 70\n\n#### Vajroli Mudra\n\nSaid to give five Siddhis, even to one who lives an ordinary life, along with\nthe _amaroli_ and _sahajoli_ , which are linked with it, this _mudra_ occupies\nanother 20 _sutras_ , or verses, which are almost impossible to translate into\nEnglish because of their mystic character. The commentary on the Sanskrit text\nsays that they are not to be understood literally. Further, they are\nincomplete in some points which are left to be filled by verbal instructions\nfrom the _guru_ , or Yoga teacher or leader.\n\n#### Shakati Chalana\n\nNamed as the last of the ten _mudras_ , this is described as follows: Having\ninhaled through the right nostril, the practitioner should retain his breath\nand "manipulate the _kundalini_ for about an hour and a half, both at morning\nand evening twilights." The Sanskrit text states:\n\n"As one forces open the door with a key, so should the Yogi force open the\ndoor of _moksha_ (state of bliss) by the _kundalini_. The _kundalini_ gives\n_mukti_ (deliverance) to the Yogis and bondage to the fools. He who knows her,\nknows Yoga. He who causes that _shakti_ (the _kundalini_ ) to move (from the\n_muladhara_ in the pelvic region upwards) is freed without doubt. Between the\n_ganges_ ( _ida_ ) and _jamuna_ ( _pingala_ ) there sits the young widow\ninspiring pity. He (the Yogi) should despoil her forcibly, for it leads one to\nthe supreme seat of Vishnu. You should awaken the sleeping serpent (\n_kundalini_ ) by taking told of its tail. Seated in the _vajrasena_ posture,\nfirmly take hold of the ankle and slowly beat with them the _kanda_ [a\nsomething below the navel from\n\np. 71\n\nwhich the 72,000 _nadis_ issue]. By moving the _kundalini_ fearlessly for\nabout an hour and a half, she is drawn upwards a little through the _susumna_\n," which process, it is claimed, "surely opens the mouth of the _susumna_ and\nthe breath naturally goes through it." Whether this effect is produced by\nmanipulation of the _kundalini_ or other means, it seems to be the object\nprimarily aimed at in Hatha Yoga practice. The fruits of the practice of Hatha\nYoga, taken in the order of their mention in the texts, are:\n\nI. The eight _siddhis_ : _anima_ (the power to assimilate oneself with an\natom); _mahima_ (the power to expand oneself into space); _laghima_ (the power\nto be as light as cotton or any similar thing); _garima_ (the power to be as\nheavy as anything); _prapti_ (the power of reaching anywhere, even to the\nmoon); _prakamya_ (the power of having all wishes, of whatever description,\nrealized); _isvata_ (power to create); _vasvita_ (power to command all).\n\n2\\. Freedom from death and old age.\n\n3\\. Rejuvenescence and perpetual youth.\n\n4\\. Beauty.\n\n5\\. Ability to "do and undo."\n\n6\\. Exemption from hunger, thirst and indolence.\n\n7\\. Ability to float on water.\n\n8\\. Attainment of anything in the three worlds.\n\n9\\. Invulnerability of wrinkles and gray hair.\n\n10\\. Removal of wrinkles and gray hair.\n\n11\\. Freedom from disease.\n\n12\\. Exemption from the effects of Karma. (See Glossary.)\n\n13\\. Immortality and the eight _siddhis_ named above.\n\n14\\. Power to attract the other sex.\n\nFinally, and beyond the _siddhis_ , comes the grand result of _mukti_ , or\nemancipation from rebirth, and the conscious\n\np. 72\n\njunction with Brahman. These powers are certainly all that could be desired;\nin fact, they stop nothing short of omnipotence, omnipresence and omniscience,\nbut we must allow for the ever-pervading Eastern hyperbole, and for the\nmystical superstructure of the ancient Hindu school of physiology.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 9.
