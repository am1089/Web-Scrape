On account of the going and of the word; for thus it is seen; and (there\nis) an inferential sign.\n\n'As people who do not know the country walk again and again over a gold\ntreasure' &c., 'thus do all these creatures day after day go into _that_\nBrahma-world' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 3, 2). The circumstance, here stated, of all\nindividual souls going to a place which the qualification _'that'_ connects\nwith the subject-matter of the whole chapter, i.e. the small ether; and the\nfurther circumstance of the goal of their going being called the Brahma-world,\nalso prove that the\n\np. 318\n\nsmall ether is none other than the highest Brahman.--But in what way do these\ntwo points prove what they are claimed to prove?--'For thus it is seen'; the\nSutra adds. For we see it stated in other texts, that all individual souls go\ndaily to Brahman, viz. in the state of deep sleep, 'All these creatures having\nbecome united with the True do not know that they are united with the True';\n'Having come back from the True they know not that they have come back from\nthe True' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 9, 2; 10, 2). And in the same way we see that the\nword 'Brahma-world' denotes the highest Brahman; so e.g.'this is the Brahma-\nworld, O King' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 32).--The Sutra subjoins a further reason.\nEven if the going of the souls to Brahman were not seen in other texts, the\nfact that the text under discussion declares the individual souls to abide in\nBrahman in the state of deep sleep, enjoying freedom from all pain and trouble\njust as if they were merged in the pralaya state, is a sufficient 'inferential\nsign' to prove that the 'small ether' is the highest Brahman. And similarly\nthe term 'Brahma-world' as exhibited in the text under discussion, if\nunderstood as denoting co-ordination (i.e. 'that world which is Brahman'), is\nsufficient to prove by itself that the 'small ether'--to which that term is\napplied--is the highest Brahman; it therefore is needless to appeal to other\npassages. That this explanation of 'Brahma-world' is preferable to the one\nwhich understands by Brahma-world 'the world of Brahman' is proved by\nconsiderations similar to those by which the Pu. Mi. Sutras prove that\n'Nishada-sthapati' means a headman who at the same time is a Nishada.--Another\nexplanation of the passage under discussion may also be given. What is said\nthere about all these creatures daily 'going into the Brahma-world,' may not\nrefer at all to the state of deep sleep, but rather mean that although 'daily\ngoing into the Brahman-world,' i. e. although at all time moving above the\nsmall ether, i. e. Brahman which as the universal Self is everywhere, yet all\nthese creatures not knowing Brahman do not find, i.e. obtain it; just as men\nnot knowing the place where a treasure is hidden do not find it, although\n\np. 319\n\nthey constantly pass over it. This constant moving about on the part of\nignorant creatures on the surface, as it were, of the small ether abiding\nwithin as their inward Ruler, proves that small ether to be the highest\nBrahman. That the highest Brahman abides within as the inner Self of creatures\nwhich dwell in it and are ruled by it, we are told in other texts also, so\ne.g. in the Antaryamin-brahma _n_ a. 'He who dwells in the Self, within the\nSelf, whom the Self does not know, of whom the Self is the body, who rules the\nSelf within; unseen but seeing, unheard but hearing' (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 22;\n23).--On this interpretation we explain the last part of the Sutra as follows.\nEven if other texts did not refer to it, this daily moving about on the part\nof ignorant creatures, on the ether within the heart--which the comparison\nwith the treasure of gold shows to be the supreme good of man--, is in itself\na sufficient proof for the small ether being Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15.
