How  \nCan less than these be bright as thou?  \nBut never nymph or heavenly maid  \nOr Goddess haunts this gloomy shade.  \nHere giants roam, a savage race;  \nWhat led thee to so dire a place?  \nHere monkeys leap from tree to tree,  \nAnd bears and tigers wander free;  \nHere ravening lions prowl, and fell  \nHyenas in the thickets yell,  \nAnd elephants infuriate roam,  \nMighty and fierce, their woodland home.  \nDost thou not dread, so soft and fair,  \nTiger and lion, wolf and bear?  \nHast thou, O beauteous dame, no fear  \nIn the wild wood so lone and drear?  \nWhose and who art thou? whence and why  \nSweet lady, with no guardian nigh,  \nDost thou this awful forest tread  \nBy giant bands inhabited?'  \n   The praise the high-souled Ravan spoke  \nNo doubt within her bosom woke. '  \nHis saintly look and Brahman guise  \nDeceived the lady's trusting eyes.  \nWith due attention on the guest  \nHer hospitable rites she pressed.  \nShe bade the stranger to a seat,  \nAnd gave him water for his feet.  \nThe bowl and water-pot he bare,  \nAnd garb which wandering Brahmans wear  \n   Forbade a doubt to rise.  \nWon by his holy look she deemed  \nThe stranger even as he seemed  \n   To her deluded eyes.  \nIntent on hospitable care,  \nShe brought her best of woodland fare.  \n   And showed her guest a seat.  \nShe bade the saintly stranger lave  \nHis feet in water which she gave,  \n   And sit and rest and eat.  \nHe kept his eager glances bent  \nOn her so kindly eloquent,  \nWife of the noblest king;  \nAnd longed in heart to steal her thence,  \nPreparing by the dire offence,  \nDeath on his head to bring.  \n\np. 284  \n\nThe lady watched with anxious face  \nFor Rama coming from the chase  \n   With Lakshman by his side:  \nBut nothing met her wandering glance  \nSave the wild forest's green expanse  \n   Extending far aud wide.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[282:1](ry244.htm#fr_496) The favourite wife of the Moon.\n\n[283:1](ry244.htm#fr_497) The planet Saturn.\n\n[283:2](ry244.htm#fr_498) Another favourite of the Moon; one of the lunar\nmansions.\n\n[283:1b](ry244.htm#fr_499) The Rudras, agents in creation, are eight in\nnumber; they sprang from the forehead of Brahma.\n\n[283:2b](ry244.htm#fr_500) Maruts, the attendants of Indra.\n\n[283:3b](ry244.htm#fr_501) Radiant demi-gods.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLVII: Ravan's Wooing.](ry245.htm)\n\n"
