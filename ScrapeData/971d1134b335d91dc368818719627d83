Incompetent Witnesses.\n\n* 157. The incompetent witnesses, too, have in this law-book been declared by the learned to be of five sorts: under a text of law, and on account of depravity, of contradiction, of uncalled-for deposition, and of intervening decease.\n\n* 158. 158 Learned Brahmans, devotees, aged persons, and ascetics, are those incapacitated under a text of law; there is no (special) reason given for it.\n\n* 159. Thieves, robbers, dangerous characters,\n\np. 83\n\ngamblers, assassins, are incompetent on account of their depravity; there is\nno truth to be found in them.\n\n160\\. If the statements of witnesses, who have all been summoned by the king\nfor the decision of the same cause, do not agree, they are rendered\nincompetent by contradiction.\n\n* 161. He who, without having been appointed to be a witness, comes of his own accord to make a deposition, is termed a spy in the law-books; he is unworthy to bear testimony.\n\n* 162. 162 Where can (any person) bear testimony if the claimant is no longer in existence, whose claim should have been heard? Such a person is an incompetent witness by reason of intervening decease.\n\n* 163. 163 If two persons quarrel with one another,\n\np. 84\n\nand if both have witnesses, the witnesses of that party shall be heard which\nwas the first to go to law.\n\n* 164. 164 If the claimant should be cast at the trial, his cause proving as the weaker one of the two, it is fit that the witnesses of the defendant should be heard.\n\n* 165. 165 No one should converse in secret with a witness summoned by his adversary, neither should he try to estrange him from the cause of his opponent by other means. A party resorting to such practices as these is cast.\n\n166. 166 If a witness dies or goes abroad after having been appointed, those who have heard his deposition may give evidence; for indirect proof (through a second-hand statement) makes evidence (as well as direct proof).\n\n* 167. 167 Even after a great lapse of time (the deposition of) a subscribing witness retains its validity;\n\np. 85\n\nif a man can write, he should write (his name) himself; if he cannot (write\nhimself), he should cause it to be written by another man.\n\n* 168. (The deposition of) a witness who has been reminded (of the transaction) remains valid in this world up to the eighth year, that of a casual witness remains valid up to the fifth year.\n\n* 169. (The deposition of) a secret witness remains valid up to the third year; (the deposition of) an indirect witness is declared to remain valid for one year only.\n\n* 170. 170 Or no definite period is fixed for judging a witness; for those acquainted with law have declared that testimony depends upon memory.\n\n* 171. A witness whose understanding, memory, and hearing have never been deranged, may give evidence even after a very considerable lapse of time.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[82:158](sbe3319.htm#fr_251) The reason why the persons referred to in this\nparagraph are excluded seems to lie in their entire renunciation of earthly\ninterests, which renders them unfit to appear in a court of justice. See Manu\nVIII, 65. where 'one dead to the world' is mentioned among the incompetent\nwitnesses, and other parallel passages.\n\n[83:162](sbe3319.htm#fr_252) Supposing a man were to claim a certain sum from\nanother and to name a witness, whom he states to have witnessed the\ntransaction. If the soi-disant creditor should die, it would be impossible to\nascertain whether the statement of the witness is true or false. Therefore\nsuch a witness must not be admitted by reason of intervening decease. A.\n\n[83:163](sbe3319.htm#fr_253) A claimant declares, 'This bull, which you have\ngot, is mine. He was stolen by thieves, who took seven cows along with him. if\nthey are found among your property, they may be known by a red mark on the\nforehead, or by their white feet, or by other signs. . . . I am able to adduce\nfour witnesses who will declare them to be mine.' The opponent replies, 'Pra\n_g_ apati (the Creator) has created many two-legged and four-legged beings\nclosely resembling one another. If a superficial likeness is to be considered\nas evidence, I might take another man's wife into my house, because she has\neyebrows, ears, a nose, eyes, a tongue, hand, and feet like my wife. This bull\nis born and bred in my own house. I am able to adduce four witnesses from the\nvillage in which he is being kept; their statements will establish the fact\nthat he belongs to me.' In a dispute of this sort the witnesses of him who was\nthe first to bring the suit into court will decide the suit. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya II, 17; Vish _n_ u VIII, 10.\n\n[84:164](sbe3319.htm#fr_254) Where the plaint is rejected and the defence\nacknowledged as correct, the witnesses of the defendant have to be examined.\nA. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 17; Vish _n_ u VIII, 11.\n\n[84:165](sbe3319.htm#fr_255) That man who holds secret conversations with a\nwitness produced by his opponent, or who tries to intimidate him by threats,\nabuse, and the like, or to bribe him, loses his suit. A.\n\n[84:166](sbe3319.htm#fr_256) If a witness dies or goes abroad, indirect\nwitnesses, i.e. those who have heard him speak of the matter, on his deathbed,\nor when he was about to start, either in answer to questions of the plaintiff,\nor of his own accord, shall be examined. A. Vish _n_ u VIII, II.\n\n[84:167](sbe3319.htm#fr_257) What follows here is intended to show how long\nthe statements of each of the five appointed witnesses mentioned in par. 150\nretain their validity. A subscribing witness may give valid evidence after the\nlapse of a very long period even. Such a witness should subscribe his name\nwith his own hand, at the time when the document is being executed, as e.g.\n'I, Devadatta, have witnessed this transaction.' If he is unable to write, he\nshould cause another person to write in his own name. The document will make\nevidence, whenever the occasion arises. A.\n\n[85:170](sbe3319.htm#fr_258) 170, 171. Under this rule, the validity of any\ntestimony is declared independent of length of time, and to depend on the\ncompetence of the witness alone. A.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 13.
