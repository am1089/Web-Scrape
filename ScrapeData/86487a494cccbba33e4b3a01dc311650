On the day preceding his Agnyadheya, he (the sacrificer with his\nwife) should take his food in the day-time. For the gods know the minds of\nman: they are, therefore, aware that his Agnyadheya is to take place on the\nmorrow; and all the gods betake themselves to his house and stay (upa-vas) in\nhis house; whence this day is called upavasatha (fast-day) 3.\n\n2:1:4:22\\. Now, as it would be unbecoming for him to take food before men (who\nare staying with him as his guests) have eaten; how much more would it be so,\nif he were to take food before the gods have eaten: let him therefore take his\nfood in the day-time. However, he may also, if he choose, take food at night,\n\np. 292\n\nsince the observance of the vow is not necessary for him who has not performed\nAgnyadheya. For so long as he has not set up a (sacrificial) fire of his own,\nhe is merely a man, and may therefore, if he choose, take food at night.\n\n2:1:4:33\\. Here now some tie up a he-goat 1, arguing that the goat is sacred\nto Agni and that (this is done) for the completeness of the fire. But he need\nnot do this. Should he possess a he-goat, let him present it to the \xc3\x82gnidhra\non the next morning; for it is thereby that he obtains the object he desires.\nHe need, therefore, take no notice of that (practice).\n\n2:1:4:44\\. They 2 then cook a rice-pap sufficient for (the) four (priests) to\neat, \'Hereby we gratify the metres,\' so they say, arguing that this is done in\nthe same way as if one were to order a team, which he is going to use for\ndriving, to be well fed. He need not, however, do this: for indeed that same\nwish (which he entertains in so doing) he obtains by the very fact that\nBrahmans, be they sacrificial priests or not, are residing in his family\n(kula) 3: he need, therefore, take no notice of that (practice).\n\n2:1:4:55\\. Having then made a hollow in it (the pap) for\n\np. 293\n\nclarified butter to be poured in, and having poured clarified butter into it,\nthey anoint three sticks of a _s_ vattha wood with this butter and put them on\nthe fire with the (three) _Ri_ k-verses containing the words \'kindling-stick\n(samidh)\' and \'butter (gh _ri_ ta) 1;\' arguing that thereby they obtain what\nhas grown out of a _s_ ami 2. It is, however, only by (daily) putting (three\nkindling-sticks) on the fire for a whole year previous (to the \xc3\x82dhana) that\none obtains that object: let him therefore take no notice of that (practice).\n\n2:1:4:66\\. And on this point Bhallabeya remarked, \'If he were to cook that\nrice-pap, this would assuredly\n\np. 294\n\nbe a mistake, just as if one were to do one thing, while intending to do\nanother; or if one were to say one thing, while intending to say another; or\nif one were to go one way, while intending to go another.\' And, indeed, it is\nnot proper that they should either carry to the south, or extinguish, that\nfire on which a kindling-stick is put, or an oblation made, with a _ri_ _k_ or\na saman or a ya _g_ us. Now they do indeed either take it to the south with\nthe view of its becoming the Anvaharyapa _k_ ana (or Dakshi _n_ agni), or (if\nthere is to be no Dakshi _n_ agni) they extinguish it 1.\n\n2:1:4:77\\. Thereupon they 2 remain awake (during that night). The gods are\nawake: so that he thereby draws nigh to the gods, and sets up his fires as one\nmore godly, more subdued, more endowed with holy fervour (tapas). He may,\nhowever, sleep, if he choose, since the observance of the vow is not necessary\nfor him who has not performed Agnyadheya. For so long as he has not set up a\n(sacrificial) fire of his own, he is a mere man; and he may, therefore, sleep,\nif he choose.\n\n2:1:4:88\\. Now some churn (the fire) 3 before sunrise and\n\np. 295\n\ntake it eastwards (from the Garhapatya to the \xc3\x82havaniya) after sunrise,\narguing that thereby they secure both the day and the night for the obtainment\nof out-breathing and in-breathing, of mind and speech. But let him not do so;\nfor when they thus churn (the fire) before sunrise, and take it eastwards\nafter sunrise, both his (fires) are in reality set up before sunrise. By\nchurning the \xc3\x82havaniya after sunrise he will obtain that (combination of\nblessings).\n\n2:1:4:99\\. The gods, assuredly, are the day. The fathers have not the evil\ndispelled from them (by the sun); (and accordingly) he (the sacrificer) does\nnot dispel the evil (if he churns the fire before sunrise). The fathers are\nmortal; and verily he who churns the fire before the rising of the sun, dies\nbefore (he has attained his full measure of) life. The gods have the evil\ndispelled from them (by the sun): hence he (the sacrificer) dispels the evil\n(from himself, if he churn after sunrise). The gods are immortal; and--though\nthere is for him no prospect of immortality--he attains (the full measure of\nlife). The gods are bliss, and bliss he obtains; the gods are glorious, and\nglorious he will be, whosoever, knowing this, churns (the fire) after the\nrising of the sun.\n\np. 296\n\n2:1:4:1010\\. Here now they say, \'If the fire is not setup with either a _ri_\nk-verse, or a saman, or a ya _g_ us, wherewith then is it set up?\' Verily,\nthat (fire) is of the brahman: with the brahman it is set up. The brahman is\nspeech: of that speech it is. The brahman is the truth, and the truth consists\nin those same (three) mystic utterances: hence his (fire) is established by\nmeans of the truth.\n\n2:1:4:1111\\. Verily, with \'bhu _h_ (earth)!\' Pra _g_ apati generated this\n(earth) 1; with \'bhuva _h_ (ether)!\' the ether; with \'sva _h_ (heaven)!\' the\nsky. As far as these (three) worlds extend, so far extends this universe: with\nthe universe it (the fire) is accordingly established.\n\n2:1:4:1212\\. With \'bhu _h_!\' Pra _g_ apati generated the Brahman (priesthood);\nwith \'bhuva _h_!\' the Kshatra (nobility); with \' _s_ va _h_!\' the Vi _s_ (the\ncommon people). As much as are the Brahman, the Kshatra, and the Vi _s_ , so\nmuch is this universe: with the universe it (the fire) is accordingly\nestablished.\n\n2:1:4:1313\\. With \'bhu _h_!\' Pra _g_ apati generated the Self; with \'bhuva\n_h_!\' the (human) race; with \'sva _h_!\' the animals (pa _s_ u). As much as are\nthe Self, the (human) race, and the animals, so much is this universe: with\nthe universe it (the fire) is accordingly established.\n\n2:1:4:1414\\. \'Bhur bhuva _h_!\' this much he utters while laying down the\nGarhapatya fire; for if he were to lay it down with all (three words),\nwherewith should he lay down the \xc3\x82havaniya? Two syllables 2\n\np. 297\n\nhe leaves over, and thereby those (five syllables) become of renewed efficacy;\nand with all the five syllables--\'Bhur bhuva _h_ sva _h_ \'--he lays down the\n\xc3\x82havaniya. Thus result eight syllables; for of eight syllables consists the\ngayatri, and the gayatri is Agni\'s metre: he thus establishes that (fire) by\nmeans of its own metre.\n\n2:1:4:1515\\. Now when the gods were about to set up their fires, the Asuras\nand Rakshas forbade them, saying, \'The fire shall not be produced; ye shall\nnot set up your fires!\' and because they thus forbade (raksh) them, they are\ncalled Rakshas.\n\n2:1:4:1616\\. The gods then perceived this thunderbolt, to wit, the horse. They\nmade it stand before them, and in its safe and foeless shelter the fire was\nproduced. For this reason let him (the Adhvaryu) direct (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) to lead\nthe horse to where he is about to churn the fire. It stands in front of him 1:\nhe thus raises the thunderbolt, and in its safe and foeless shelter the fire\nis produced.\n\n2:1:4:1717\\. Let it be one used as a leader 2; for such a one possesses\nunlimited strength. Should he be unable to obtain a leader, it may be any kind\nof horse. Should he be unable to obtain a horse, it may also be an ox, since\nthat (fire) is related (bandhu) to the ox 3.\n\n2:1:4:1818\\. And when they carry that (fire) eastward 4,\n\np. 298\n\nthey lead the horse in front of it; so that, in proceeding in front of it, it\nwards off from it the evil spirits, the Rakshas; and they carry it (to the\n\xc3\x82havaniya) safely and unmolested by evil spirits.\n\n2:1:4:1919\\. Let them carry it (the fire) in such wise that it turns back\ntowards him (the sacrificer); for, assuredly, that fire is the (means of)\nsacrifice, and it is in the direction of him (the sacrificer) that the\nsacrifice enters him, that the sacrifice readily inclines to him. And, verily,\nfrom whomsoever it (the fire) turns away, from him the sacrifice also turns\naway; and if any one were to curse him, saying, \'May the sacrifice turn away\nfrom him!\' then he would indeed be liable to fare thus.\n\n2:1:4:2020\\. Moreover, that (fire) is the (sacrificer\'s) breath: let them\ntherefore carry it in such wise that it turns\n\np. 299\n\nback towards him; for it is in the direction of him that the breath enters\ninto him. And, verily, from whomsoever it (the fire) turns away, from him the\nbreath also turns away; and if in that case any one were to curse him, saying,\n\'May the breath turn away from him!\' then he would indeed be liable to fare\nthus.\n\n2:1:4:2121\\. And, verily, the sacrifice is yonder blowing (wind). Let them,\ntherefore, carry it in such wise that it 1 turns towards him; for it is in the\ndirection of him that the sacrifice enters him, that the sacrifice readily\ninclines to him. And from whomsoever it turns away, from him the sacrifice\nalso turns away; and if any one were to curse him, saying, \'May the sacrifice\nturn away from him!\' then he would indeed be liable to fare thus.\n\n2:1:4:2222\\. And, verily, that (fire) is the (sacrificer\'s) breath. Let them,\ntherefore, carry it in such wise that it turns towards him; for it is in the\ndirection of him that the breath enters into him. And from whomsoever it (the\nfire) turns away; from him the breath also turns away; and if any one were to\ncurse him, saying, \'May the breath turn away from him!\' he would indeed be\nliable to fare thus.\n\n2:1:4:2323\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then makes the horse step on (the \xc3\x82havaniya\nfire-place) 2. When he has made it step on it, he leads it out towards the\neast, makes it turn round again (from left to right) and lets it\n\np. 300\n\nstand there facing the west. The horse doubtless represents strength: hence he\nmakes it turn round again in order that this strength shall not turn away from\nhim (the sacrificer).\n\n2:1:4:2424\\. He lays that (fire) down on the horse\'s footprint 1; for the\nhorse represents strength, so that he thereby lays it down on strength: for\nthis reason he lays it down on the horse\'s foot-print.\n\n2:1:4:2525\\. In the first place he silently touches (the footprint with the\nburning fire-wood). He then lifts it up and touches once more with it; and at\nthe third time he lays it down with (Va _g_. S. III, 5), \'Earth! ether!\nheaven!\' For there are three worlds indeed; so that he thereby obtains these\n(three) worlds. This now is one (mode of laying down the fire).\n\n2:1:4:2626\\. Then there is this other. Silently he touches (the foot-print\nwith it) in the first place; he then lifts it up, and at the second time lays\nit down with \'Earth! ether! heaven!\' For he who wants to lift a load without\nhaving a firm footing on this (earth), cannot lift it; nay, it crushes him.\n\n2:1:4:2727\\. Now, when he touches it silently he thereby takes a firm footing\non this resting-place; and having obtained a firm footing on it, he lays down\n(the fire): and thus he wavers not. Here now \xc3\x82suri, Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ i, and Madhuki\nheld it (the fire) slightly to the back (or west of the fire-place) 2. \'For,\'\nthey argued, \'everything else (that is on the hearth)\n\np. 301\n\nbecomes, as it were, relaxed (on being touched by the fire): he should\ntherefore, after holding it up, lay it down at the first (touching) with\n"Earth! ether! heaven!" for thus no relaxation takes place.\' Let him then do\nthis in whichever way he may deem proper.\n\n2:1:4:2828\\. He (the sacrificer) then goes round to the east side (of the\nfire), and taking hold of the top part of the burning sticks he mutters (Va\n_g_. S. III, 5): \'Like unto the sky in plenty, like unto the earth in\ngreatness!\' When he says, \'Like unto the sky in plenty,\' he means to say,\n\'Like as yonder sky is plenteous with stars, so may I become plenteous!\' and\nwhen he says, \'Like unto the earth in greatness,\' he means to say, \'As great\nas this earth is so great may I become!\'--\'On that back of thine, O Earth,\nthat art meet for the worship of the gods\'--for on her back he lays down that\n(fire)--\'I lay down Agni, the eater of food, for the obtainment of food.\' Agni\nis an eater of food: \'May I become an eater of food,\' this is what he thereby\nsays. This is a prayer for blessing,--he may mutter it, if he choose; or, if\nhe choose, he may omit it.\n\n2:1:4:2929\\. He stands worshipping by (the fire) while muttering the (three)\n_Ri_ k-verses of the queen of serpents (Va _g_. S. III, 6-8) 1,--\'Hither has\ncome that spotted bull and has settled down before the mother; and before the\nfather on going up to heaven.--She moves along through the luminous spheres,\nbreathing forth from his breath: the mighty (bull) has illumined\n\np. 302\n\nthe sky.--He rules over the thirty domains; and song is bestowed on the winged\none, yea, with the light at the break of day!\' Thus he recites; and whatever\n(benefit) has not been obtained by him either through the equipments, or\nthrough the asterisms, or through the seasons, or through the laying down of\nthe fire, all that is thereby obtained by him; and for this reason he stands\nworshipping by (the fire), while muttering the verses of the queen of\nserpents.\n\n2:1:4:3030\\. They say, however, that one need not stand by (the fire)\nworshipping with the verses of the queen of serpents. For the queen of\nserpents, they argue, is this earth; and accordingly when he lays down the\nfire on her, he thereby obtains all his desires: hence he need not stand by\n(the fire) worshipping with the verses of the queen of serpents.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[291:3](sbe1243.htm#fr_674) See I, 1, 1, 7 seq.\n\n[292:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_675) This practice is perhaps the remnant of a former\nanimal offering. See I, 2, 3, 6, where the goat is mentioned as the last of\nthe animals meet for sacrifice.\n\n[292:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_676) That is, as would seem, those ritualists who\nmaintain that a goat should be tied up for that night. The Ka _n_ va text\nreads, \'Here some cook that night that _k_ atu _h_ pra _s_ ya rice-pap, saying\n(vadanta _h_ ), "Hereby we gratify the metres."\' According to the Paddhati on\nKaty IV, 8, the quotation \'Hereby we gratify the metres\' seems to form the\nlast of the formulas pronounced by the sacrificer, while washing the feet of\nthe priests and offering them food.\n\n[292:3](sbe1243.htm#fr_677) \'The fulfilment of that wish he obtains through\nBrahmans, whether officiating priests or not, staying in his house (kula) and\ntaking food there.\' Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[293:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_678) The three verses containing the words samidh and\ngh _ri_ ta are Va _g_. S. III, 1, 3, 4. Taitt. Br. I, 2, 1, 9-10 has them in\nthe order 1, 4, 3; and does not give the verse Va _g_. S. III, 2 (Rig-veda V,\n5, s). As neither version of our Brahma _n_ a makes any mention of this verse,\nit may be doubted whether originally it formed part of the Sa _m_ hita.\nAccording to Katy. IV, 8, 5-6 he (? the Adhvaryu) is to put on (the three\nkindling-sticks) with Va _g_. S. III, i, &c., one verse with each stick;\nwhereupon he, (the sacrificer, according to the commentary) is to mutter III,\n4; and according to ib. 7 \'the Adhvaryu optionally mutters the second.\' The\nPaddhati reconciles the different statements thus: he takes the sticks, rises\nand puts the first on the fire with III, 1; then sitting down he mutters III,\n2; thereupon he again rises and puts on the second with III, 3, and the third\nwith III, 4. The commentator, however, alludes to differences of practice in\ndifferent schools as to this point.\n\n[293:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_679) The sacrificial fire, to be set up at the \xc3\x82dheya,\nshould probably be produced by means of two pieces of a _s_ vattha wood which\nhas grown out of a _s_ ami tree. Saya _n_ a remarks that the ritualists\nreferred to in our passage consider that the cooking of the rice-pap takes\nplace, not with the view of the latter being eaten by the priests, but merely\nto afford an opportunity for putting the kindling-sticks on the fire, and\nthereby securing to the sacrificer the benefits that would have accrued to\nhire from the above mode of ignition. This view, however, is not countenanced\nby our author, who, on the contrary, favours the daily cooking of a mess of\nrice-pap for the four priests for a twelvemonth preceding the Agnyadheya, as a\nsubstitute for the production of the fire by friction. See Katy. IV, 8, 11\n(and Paddhati).\n\n[294:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_680) His argument seems to be that, since the cooking\nof the rice-pap involves the putting on of consecrated sticks with sacrificial\nformulas, one is not to cook the pap because that same fire will afterwards\nhave to be extinguished or to be taken to the Dakshi _n_ agni hearth. The\npassage is, however, far from clear to me.\n\n[294:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_681) Viz. the ritualists referred to; that is to say,\nthey make the sacrificer and his wife remain awake all night. Saya _n_ a takes\n_g_ agrati to stand for _g_ agarti, \'he, the sacrificer, remains awake.\' The\nKa _n_ va text, however, has, \'Here now they say, he should remain awake that\nnight.\'\n\n[294:3](sbe1243.htm#fr_682) The production of the sacred fire by means of two\nsticks (ara _n_ i) of the a _s_ vattha (Ficus Religiosa) is thus described by\nStevenson, \'Translation of the Sama Veda,\' pref. p. vii: \'The process by which\nfire is obtained from wood is called churning, as it resembles p. 295 that by\nwhich butter in India is separated from milk. The New-Hollanders obtain fire\nfrom a similar process. It consists in drilling one piece of ara _n_ i wood\ninto another by pulling a string tied to it with a jerk with the one hand,\nwhile the other is slackened, and so alternately till the wood takes fire. The\nfire is received on cotton or flax held in the hand of an assistant Brahman.\'\nOn the mythological associations of the agni-manthana, especially with the\nTeutonic need-fire and the myth of Prometheus; and those of the a _s_ vattha\ntree, grown out of a _s_ ami, with the mountain-ash (roun-tree, rowan-tree,\nwitch-elm, witchen, witch-hazel, witch-wood; eber-esche), see A. Kuhn\'s epoch-\nmaking essay, \'Ueber die Herabkunft des Feuers and des Gottertranks.\'\n\n[296:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_683) Compare XI, 1, 6, 3.\n\n[296:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_684) Viz. sva _h_ , pronounced su-va _h_. In laying\ndown the Garhapatya he utters the first two words, consisting of three\nsyllables; and in laying down the \xc3\x82havaniya he pronounces all three words,\nconsisting of five syllables.\n\n[297:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_685) The horse is to stand east of the Garhapatya fire-\nplace, with its head to the west, where, behind the khara, the Adhvaryu is\nabout to produce the fire.\n\n[297:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_686) Purvavah, \'drawing in front,\' i.e. a young (newly-\nharnessed) horse. The term may also mean \'conveying eastwards,\' whence it is\nprobably used here; cf. Taitt. Br. I, 1, 5, 6.\n\n[297:3](sbe1243.htm#fr_687) See XIII, 8, 4, 6, where the ox is said to be\nsacred to Agni (agneya). See also p. 292, note 1; and I, 2, 3, 6.\n\n[297:4](sbe1243.htm#fr_688) The following particulars, not alluded to by our\nauthor, have p. 298 to be supplied here from Katy. IV, 8, 29 seq., and the\ncommentaries: As soon as fire has been obtained from the two pieces of wood,\n[it is placed in a pan and covered with dry, powdered gomaya; and] the\nsacrificer blows it with \'Breath I bestow on the immortal;\' and the well-\nkindled flame he inhales with \'The immortal I bestow on the breath\' (see II,\n2) 2, 15). The fire is then set ablaze with fire-wood and laid down on the\nnewly-made Garhapatya hearth-mound with \'[Om!] Bhur bhuva _h_ sva _h_!\' (Va\n_g_. S. III, 5); and with \'I lay thee down, O Lord of Vows (vratapati), with\nthe law (vrata) of N. N?\'--the gotra-name being inserted in the case of the Bh\n_ri_ gus and A\xe1\xb9\x85giras; and those of different _Ri_ shis or gods and divine\nbeings in that of others. At the sacrificer\'s bidding the Brahman or Adhvaryu\nthen chants the Rathantara-saman (cf. [p. 196](sbe1231.htm#page_196), note\n[2](sbe1231.htm#fn_446)). Then follows the uddhara _n_ a or taking out fire\nfrom the Garhapatya for the \xc3\x82havaniya. A bundle of wood is lighted at the\nlower ends on the Garhapatya and placed in a pan on an underlayer of clay. It\nis then carried eastwards in such a way that the smoke is directed towards the\nsacrificer following it; the horse being led in front of the fire. At the\nstarting of the procession the Brahman, at the Adhvaryu\'s call, chants the\nVamadevya-saman.\n\n[299:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_689) Viz. the wind indicated by the backward-turned\nflame of the fire, as it is carried eastwards to the \xc3\x82havaniya.\n\n[299:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_690) The Adhvaryu sits down and makes the horse put its\nright fore-foot on the recently prepared hearth-mound. Having then led it\neastwards and turned it round, he calls on the Brahman to chant the B _ri_\nhat-saman (see [p. 196](sbe1231.htm#page_196), note [2](sbe1231.htm#fn_446)).\n\n[300:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_691) Taitt. Br. I, 1, 5, 9, on the contrary, forbids\nthe fire to be laid down on the horse\'s foot-print, as the sacrificer\'s cattle\nis thereby surrendered to Rudra. Moreover, the horse is there made to step\nbeside, not upon, the hearth-mound.\n\n[300:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_692) The Ka _n_ va text reads: Tad v \xc3\x82suri _h_ Pa _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ ir Madhukir iti dadhrire, \'here now they held it thus.\'\n\n[301:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_693) These verses form the hymn Rig-veda X, 189, the\nauthorship of which is ascribed to the queen of serpents (either Kadru, or the\nearth, according to Mahidhara).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 1.
