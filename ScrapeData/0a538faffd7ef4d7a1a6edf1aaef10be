O turn thine eye:  \nWhy are thy cold lips silent, why?  \nWhen first we met as youth and maid.  \nWhen in thy hand my hand was laid,  \nThy promise was thy steps should be  \nThrough life in duty\'s path with me.  \nRemember, faithful still, thy vow,  \nAnd take me with thee even now.  \nIs that broad bosom where I hung,  \nThat neck to which I fondly clung,  \nWhere flowery garlands breathed their scent  \nBy hungry dogs and vultures rent?  \nShall no funereal honours grace  \nThe parted lord of Raghu\'s race,  \nWhose bounty liberal fees bestowed.  \nFor whom the fires of worship glowed?  \nKaus\'alya wild with grief will see  \nOne sole survivor of the three  \nWho in their hermit garments went  \nTo the dark woods in banishment.  \nThen at her cry shall Lakshman tell  \nHow, slain by night, the Vanars fell;  \nHow to thy side the giants crept,  \nAnd slew the hero as he slept.  \nThy fate and mine the queen will know,  \nAnd broken-hearted die of woe.  \nFor my unworthy sake, for mine,  \nRama, the glory of his line,  \nWho bridged his way across the main,  \nIs basely in a puddle slain;  \nAnd I, the graceless wife he wed,  \nHave brought this ruin on his head.  \nMe, too, on him, O Ravan, slay:  \n\nThe wife beside her husband lay.  \nBy his dear body let me rest,  \nCheek close to cheek and breast to breast,  \nMy happy eyes I then will close.  \nAnd follow whither Rama goes.\'  \n   Thus cried the miserable dame;  \nWhen to the king a warder came,  \nBefore the giant monarch bowed  \nAnd said that, followed by a crowd  \nOf counsellors and lords of state,  \nPrahasta stood before the gate,  \nAnd, sent by some engrossing care,  \nCraved audience of his master there.  \nThe anxious tyrant left his seat  \nAnd hastened forth the chief to meet:  \nThen summoning his nobles all,  \nTook counsel in his regal hall.  \n   When Lanka\'s lord had left the queen,  \nThe head and bow no more were seen.  \nThe giant king his nobles eyed,  \nAnd, terrible as Yama, cried:  \n\'O faithful lords, the time is come:  \nGather our hosts with beat of drum.  \nNigh to the town our foeman draws:  \nBe prudent, nor reveal the cause.\'  \n   The nobles listened and obeyed:  \nSwift were the gathered troops arrayed,  \nAnd countless rovers of the night  \nStood burning for the hour of tight.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXIII.: Sarama.](ry432.htm)\n\n'
