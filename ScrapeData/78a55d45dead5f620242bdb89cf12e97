And because the objections (raised by the Sa _n_ khya against the Vedanta\ndoctrine) apply to his view also.\n\nThe doctrine of our opponent is liable to the very same objections which he\nurges against us, viz. in the following manner.--The objection that this world\ncannot have sprung from Brahman on account of its difference of character\napplies no less to the doctrine of the pradhana being the cause of the world;\nfor that doctrine also assumes that from a pradhana devoid of sound and other\nqualities a world is produced which possesses those very qualities. The\nbeginning of an effect different in character being thus admitted, the Sa _n_\nkhya is equally driven to the doctrine that before the actual beginning the\neffect was non-existent. And, moreover, it being admitted (by the Sa _n_ khya\nalso) that at the time of reabsorption the effect passes back into the state\nof non-distinction from the cause, the case of the Sa _n_ khya here also is\nthe same as ours.--And, further, if\n\np. 314\n\n[paragraph continues] (as the Sa _n_ khya also must admit) at the time of\nreabsorption the differences of all the special effects are obliterated and\npass into a state of general non-distinction, the special fixed conditions,\nwhich previous to reabsorption were the causes of the different worldly\nexistence of each soul, can, at the time of a new creation, no longer be\ndetermined, there being no cause for them; and if you assume them to be\ndetermined without a cause, you are driven to the admission that even the\nreleased souls have to re-enter a state of bondage, there being equal absence\nof a cause (in the case of the released and the non-released souls). And if\nyou try to avoid this conclusion by assuming that at the time of reabsorption\nsome individual differences pass into the state of non-distinction, others\nnot, we reply that in that case the latter could not be considered as effects\nof the pradhana 1.--It thus appears that all those difficulties (raised by the\nSa _n_ khya) apply to both views, and cannot therefore be urged against either\nonly. But as either of the two doctrines must necessarily be accepted, we are\nstrengthened-\xc2\x97by the outcome of the above discussion--in the opinion that the\nalleged difficulties are no real difficulties 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[314:1](sbe34149.htm#fr_277) For if they are effects of the pradhana they must\nas such be reabsorbed into it at the time of general reabsorption.\n\n[314:2](sbe34149.htm#fr_278) And that the Vedanta view is preferable because\nthe nullity of the objections has already been demonstrated in its case.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 11](sbe34150.htm)\n\n'
