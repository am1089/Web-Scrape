But like the eye and the rest, on account of being taught with them, and\nfor other reasons.\n\nBreath is not an element, but like sight and the rest, a special instrument of\nthe soul. This appears from the fact that the texts mention it together with\nthe recognised organs of the soul, the eye, and so on; so e.g. in the colloquy\nof the pra _n_ as. And such common mention is suitable in the case of such\nthings only as belong to one class.--The 'and for other reasons' of the Sutra\nrefers to the circumstance of the principal breath being specially mentioned\namong the organs comprised under the term 'pra _n_ a'; cp. 'that principal\nbreath' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 2, 7); 'that central breath' (B _ri_. Up. I, 5, 21).--\nBut if the chief breath is, like the eye and the other organs, an instrument\nof the soul, there must be some special form of activity through which it\nassists the soul, as the eye e.g. assists the soul by seeing. But no such\nactivity is perceived, and the breath cannot therefore be put in the same\ncategory as the organs of sensation and action!--To this objection the next\nSutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 10.
