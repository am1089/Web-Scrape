Next follows the right wing. It is this world (the earth), it is this\nAgni, it is speech, it is the Rathantara 1, it is Vasish _th_ a, it is a\nhundred 2. These are the six powers (of the right wing) 3. The Sampata hymn\n(Rv. IV, 20) serves indeed for obtaining desires and for firmness. The Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti\nverse (Rv. I, 80, 1) serves for proper food.\n\n2\\. Next comes the Sudadohas verse. Sudadohas is breath, thereby he joins all\njoints with breath.\n\n3\\. Next follows the left wing. It is that world (heaven), it is that sun, it\nis mind, it is the Brihat, it\n\np. 190\n\na, it is a hundred 1. These are the six powers (of the left wing). The Sampata\nhymn (Rv. IV, 23) serves indeed for obtaining desires and for firmness. The\nPa\xe1\xb9\x85kti verse (Rv. I, 81, 1) serves for proper food.\n\n4\\. These two (the right and the left wings) are deficient and excessive 2.\nThe Brihat (the left wing) is man, the Rathantara (the right wing) is woman.\nThe excess belongs to the man, the deficiency to the woman. Therefore they are\ndeficient and excessive.\n\n5\\. Now the left wing of a bird is verily by one feather better, therefore the\nleft wing is larger by one verse.\n\np. 191\n\n6\\. Next comes the Sudadohas verse. Sudadohas is breath, and thereby he joins\nall joints with breath.\n\n7\\. Next follows the tail. They are twenty-one Dvipada verses 1. For there are\ntwenty-one backward feathers in a bird.\n\n8\\. Then the Ekavi _m_ sa is the support of all Stomas, and the tail the\nsupport of all birds 2.\n\n9\\. He recites a twenty-second verse. This is made the form of two supports.\nTherefore all birds support themselves on their tail, and having supported\nthemselves on their tail, they fly up. For the tail is a support.\n\n10\\. He (the bird and the hymn) is supported by two decades which are Vira\n_g_. The man (the sacrificer) is supported by the two Dvipadas, the twenty\nfirst and twenty-second. That which forms the bird serves for the attainment\nof all desires; that which forms the man, serves for his happiness, glory,\nproper food, and honour.\n\n11\\. Next comes a Sudadohas verse, then a Dhayya, then a Sudadohas verse. The\nSudadohas is a man, the Dhayya a woman, therefore he recites the Dhayya as\nembraced on both sides by the Sudadohas. Therefore does the seed of both, when\nit is effused, obtain oneness, and this with regard to the\n\np. 192\n\nwoman only. Hence birth takes place in and from the woman. Therefore he\nrecites that Dhayya in that place [1](sbe01198.htm#fn_473).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[189:1](sbe01197.htm#fr_468) Rathantara is the name of the whole number of\nhymns to be recited at this part of the sacrifice.
