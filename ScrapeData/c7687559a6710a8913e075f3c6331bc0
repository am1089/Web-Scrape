No blame attaches to a sale effected in public,\nbut a clandestine sale is viewed in the same light as theft according to law.\n\n* 3. 3 If a man buys from a slave who has not been authorized (to sell) by his master, or from a rogue, or in secret, or at a very low price, or at an improper time, he is as guilty as the seller.\n\n* 4. 4 The purchaser must not make a secret of the way in which he came by a chattel (purchased by him). He becomes free from blame if he can point out the way in which the chattel was acquired by him. In any other case he is equally guilty with the vendor, and shall suffer the punishment of a thief.\n\n* 5. 5 The vendor shall restore his property to the rightful owner, and shall pay to the buyer the price for which it was sold to him; besides that he shall pay a fine to the king. Such is the rule in the case\n\np. 146\n\nof a sale effected by another than the rightful owner.\n\n6. 6 If any one finds a treasure, which had been deposited by a stranger, he shall take it to the king. Every treasure, found by members of any caste, belongs to the king, excepting (those treasures which have been found by) members of the Brahman caste.\n\n7\\. A Brahman even, when he has found a treasure, must at once give notice to\nthe king. If the king gives it to him he may enjoy it. If he does not give\nnotice, he is (viewed as) a thief.\n\n8\\. Of his own property also, which he had lost and found again afterwards, a\nman must give notice to the king. If he does so, he may keep it as his lawful\nproperty. It is not his lawful property otherwise.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[144:1](sbe3339.htm#fr_428) VII, 1. The term 'property kept as a deposit'\nincludes by implication a Ya _k_ ita and the other species of bailments.\nViramitrodaya, p. 374, and the other commentaries. See II. Title of Law, 14,\n15.\n\n[144:2](sbe3339.htm#fr_429) The owner of a chattel, which has been sold by a\nstranger who has no right to it, may reclaim it from any one who happens to be\npossessed of it. Viramitrodaya, P. 375; Vish _n_ u V, 164-166; Manu VIII, 201,\n202; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 168. In the Nepalese MS. the last clause runs as\nfollows: 'The buyer who buys in secret is guilty of theft.'\n\n[145:3](sbe3339.htm#fr_430) 'One who has not been authorized (to sell) by his\nmaster,' one who has received no special permission from him (to sell the\nchattel). The term 'a slave' has to be interpreted in a pregnant sense, so as\nto include young sons and other dependent persons. Viramitrodaya, p. 375. Vish\n_n_ u V, 166; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 168.\n\n[145:4](sbe3339.htm#fr_431) It appears from the detailed provisions of B _ri_\nhaspati, Katyayana, and other Sm _ri_ ti-writers on the subject of purchase\nand sale, that every purchase, in order to be legitimate, had to be concluded\nin open market, on a market day or hour; or that, at least, the purchaser was\nrequired to produce the vendor, when the purchase had not been made in open\nmarket. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 168. The Nepalese MS. inserts the following\nparagraph here: 'Any purchase or sale which has been effected by another than\nthe rightful owner must be known to be invalid; this is a rule in lawsuits.'\nThe quotations in the Viramitrodaya and other works prove this verse to be\ngenuine. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 170.\n\n[145:5](sbe3339.htm#fr_432) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 170.\n\n[146:6](sbe3339.htm#fr_433) 6-8. Gautama X, 36-38, 43-45; Vasish _th_ a III,\n13-14; XVI, 19, 20; Manu VIII, 30-39; Vish _n_ u V, 56-64; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\nII, 33-35. The position of the two last paragraphs is inverted in the Nepalese\nMS.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Eighth Title of Law. Non-Delivery of a Sold Chattel](sbe3340.htm)\n\n"
