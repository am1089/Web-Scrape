Prayer for exemption from the dangers of death.\n\n1\\. To the 'Ender,' to Death be reverence! May thy in-breathing and thy out-\nbreathing remain here! United here with (life's) spirit this man shall be,\nsharing in the sun, in the world of immortality (amrita)!  \n2\\. Bhaga has raised him up, Soma with his rays (has raised) him up, the\nMaruts, the gods, (have raised) him up, Indra and Agni (have raised) him up\nunto well-being.  \n3\\. Here (shall be) thy (life's) spirit, here thy inbreathing, here thy life,\nhere thy mind! We rescue thee from the toils of Nirriti (destruction) by means\nof our divine utterance.  \n4\\. Rise up hence, O man! Casting off the footshackles of death, do not sink\ndown! Be not cut off from this world, from the sight of Agni and the sun!  \n5\\. The wind, Matarisvan, shall blow for thee, the waters shall shower amrita\n(ambrosia) upon thee, the sun shall shine kindly for thy body! Death shall\npity thee: do not waste away!  \n6\\. Thou shalt ascend and not descend, O man! Life and alertness do I prepare\nfor thee. Mount, forsooth, this imperishable, pleasant car; then in old age\nthou shalt hold converse with thy family!  \n7\\. Thy mind shall not go thither, shall not disappear! Do not become heedless\nof the living, do not follow the Fathers! All the gods shall preserve thee\nhere!  \n8\\. Do not long after the departed, who conduct (men) afar! Ascend from the\ndarkness, come to the light! We lay hold of thy hands.  \n9\\. The two dogs of Yama, the black and the brindled one, that guard the road\n(to heaven), that have been despatched, shall not (go after) thee! Come\nhither, do not long to be away; do not tarry here with thy mind turned to a\ndistance!  \n10\\. Do not follow this path: it is terrible! I speak of that by which thou\nhast not hitherto gone. Darkness is this, O man, do not enter it! Danger is\nbeyond, security here for thee.  \n11\\. May the fires that are within the waters gLiard thee, may (the fire)\nwhich men kindle guard thee, may Gatavedas Vaisvanara (the fire common to all\nmen) guard thee! Let not the heavenly (fire) together with the lightning burn,\nthee!  \n12\\. Let not the flesh-devouring (fire) menace thee: move afar from the\nfuneral pyre! Heaven shall guard thee, the earth shall guard thee, the sun and\nmoon shall guard thee, the atmosphere shall guard thee against the divine\nmissile!  \n13\\. May the alert and the watchful divinities guard thee, may he that sleeps\nnot and nods not guard thee, may he that protects and is vigilant guard thee!  \n14\\. They shall guard thee, they shall protect thee. Reverence be to them.\nHail be to them!  \n15\\. Into converse with the living Vayu, Indra, Dhatar, and saving Savitar\nshall put thee; breath and strength shall not leave thee! Thy (life's) spirit\ndo we call back to thee.  \n16\\. Convulsions that draw the jaws together, darkness, shall not come upon\nthee, nor (the demon) that tears out the tongue (?)! How shalt thou then waste\naway? The \xc3\x82dityas and Vasus, Indra and Agni shall raise thee up unto well-\nbeing!  \n17\\. The heavens, the earth, Pragapati, have rescued thee. The plants with\nSoma their king have delivered thee from death.  \n18\\. Let this man remain right here, ye gods, let him not depart hence to\nyonder world! We rescue him from death with (a charm) of thousandfold\nstrength.  \n19\\. I have delivered thee from death. The (powers) that furnish strength\nshall breathe upon thee. The (mourning women) with dishevelled hair, they that\nwail lugubriously, shall not wail over thee!  \n20\\. I have snatched thee (from death), I have obtained thee; thou hast\nreturned with renewed youth. O thou, that art (now) sound of limb, for thee\nsound sight, and sound life have I obtained.  \n21\\. It has shone upon thee, light has arisen, darkness has departed from\nthee. We remove from thee death, destruction, and disease.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 2.
