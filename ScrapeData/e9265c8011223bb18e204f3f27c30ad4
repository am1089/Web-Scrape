To the elements (the soul, with pra _n_ a, goes), on account of the\nsubsequent scriptural clause.\n\nThe soul joined by the pra _n_ a takes up its abode within the subtle elements\nwhich accompany heat and form the seed of the (gross) body. This we conclude\nfrom the clause, 'Breath in heat.'--But this passage declares, not that the\nsoul together with the pra _n_ a takes up its abode in heat, but only that the\npra _n_ a takes up its abode!--No matter, we reply; since the preceding Sutra\nintercalates the soul in the interval (between pra _n_ a and te _g_ as). Of a\nman who first travels from-- _S_ rughna to Mathura and then from Mathura to Pa\n_t_ aliputra, we may say shortly that he travels from-- _S_ rughna to Pa _t_\naliputra. The passage under discussion therefore means that the soul together\nwith the pra _n_ a abides in the elements associated with heat.--But how are\nyou entitled to draw in the other elements also, while the text only speaks of\nheat?--To this question the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 6](sbe38286.htm)\n\n"
