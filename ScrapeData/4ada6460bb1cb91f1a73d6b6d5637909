 \nIf many autumns here I spent  \nWith thee, my darling innocent;  \nAnd Lakshman, I should never know  \nThe torture of the fires of woe,  \nThis varied scene so charms my sight,  \nThis mount so fills me with delight,  \nWhere flowers in wild profusion spring,  \nAnd ripe fruits glow and sweet birds sing.  \nMy beauteous one, a double good  \nSprings from my dwelling in the wood:  \nLoosed is the bond my sire that tied  \nAnd Bharat too is gratified.  \nMy darling, dost thou feel with me  \nDelight from every charm we see,  \nOf which the mind and every sense  \nFeel the enchanting influence?  \nMy fathers who have passed away,  \nThe royal saints, were wont to say  \n\nThat life in woodland shades like this  \nSecures a king immortal bliss.  \nSee, round the hill at random thrown.  \nHuge masses lie of rugged stone  \nOf every shape and many a hue,  \nYellow and white and red and blue.  \nBut all is fairer still by night:  \nEach rock reflects a softer light,  \nWhen the whole mount from foot to crest  \nIn robes of lambent flame is dressed;  \nWhen from a million herbs a blaze  \nOf their own luminous glory plays,  \nAnd clothed in fire each deep ravine,  \nEach pinnacle and crag is seen.  \nSome parts the look of mansions wear,  \nAnd others are as gardens fair,  \nWhile others seem a massive block  \nOf solid undivided rock.  \nBehold those pleasant beds o'erlaid  \nWith lotus leaves, for lovers made,  \nWhere mountain birch and *costus throw  \nCool shadows on the pair below.  \nSee where the lovers in their play  \nHave cast their flowery wreaths away,  \nAnd fruit and lotus buds that crowned  \nTheir brows lie trodden on the ground.  \nNorth Kuru's realm is fair to see,  \nVasvaukasara, [1b](ry173.htm#fn_371) Nalini, [2b](ry173.htm#fn_372)  \nBut rich in fruit and blossom still  \nMore fair is Chitrakuta's hill.  \nHere shall the years appointed glide  \nWith thee, my beauty, by my side,  \n   And Lakshman ever near;  \nHere shall I live in all delight,  \nMake my ancestral fame more bright,  \nTread in their path who walk aright,  \n   And to my oath adhere.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[202:1](ry172.htm#fr_369) These ten lines are a substitution for, and not a\ntranslation of the text which Carey and Marshman thus render: 'This mountain\nadorned with mango,(1) jumboo,(2) usuna,(3) lodhra, (4) piala, (5) punusa, (6)\ndhava, (7) p. 203 unkotha, (8) bhuvya,(9) tinisha, (10) vilwa, (11) tindooka,\n(12) bamboo,(13) kashmaree,(14) urista,(l5) vuruna,(16) madhooka,(17) tilaka,\n(18) vuduree,(l9) amluka,(20) nipa,(21) vetra,(22) dhunwuna,(23) veejaka,(24)\nand other trees affording flowers, and fruits, and the most delightful shade,\nhow charming does it appear!'\n\n   1 Mangifera Indica. 2 Eugenia Jambolifera, 3 Terminalialata tomentosa. 4\nThis tree is not ascertained. 5 Chironjia Sapida. 6 Artocarpus integrifolia. 7\nGrislea tomentosa. 8 Allangium hexapetalum. 9 Averrhoa carimbola. 10 Dalbergia\nOujeinensis. 11 \xc3\x86gle marmelos. 12 Diospyrus melanoxylon. 13 Well known. 14\nGmelina Arborea. 15 Sapindus Saponaria. 16 Cratoeva tapia. l7 Bassia la\ntifolia. 18 Not yet ascertained. 19 Zizyphus jujuba. 20 Phyllanthus emblica.\n21 Nauclea Orientalis. 22 Calamusrotang. 23 Echites antidysenterica. 34 The\ncitron tree.'\n\n[203:1](ry172.htm#fr_370) _Vidyadharis_ , Spirits of Air, sylphs.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XCV.: Mandakini.](ry173.htm)\n\n"
