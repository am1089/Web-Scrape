Narayanasvami Aiyar, [1914], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 37\n\n### \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xacMABO\xe1\xb8\x8cHA 1-UPANISHA\xe1\xb8\x8c\n\n### OF\n\n### \xe1\xb9\x9aGVE\xe1\xb8\x8cA\n\nOm. Prostrations to N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a wearing conch, discus, and mace, 2 by whom the\nYogi is released from the bondage of the cycle of rebirth through the\nutterance of Him who is of the form of Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava, the Om, composed of the three\nletters A, U, and M, who is the uniform bliss and who is the Brahmapurusha\n(all-pervading Purusha). Om. Therefore the reciter of the Man\xe1\xb9\xadra "Om-namo-\nN\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81ya" reaches the Vaiku\xe1\xb9\x87tha world. It is the heart-Kamala (lotus),\n_viz_., the city of Brahman. It is effulgent like lightning, shining like a\nlamp. It is Brahma\xe1\xb9\x87ya (the presider over the city of Brahman) that is the son\nof \xe1\xb8\x8cevak\xc4\xab. It is Brahma\xe1\xb9\x87ya that is Ma\xe1\xb8\x8dhus\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8dana (the killer of Ma\xe1\xb8\x8dhu). It is\nBrahma\xe1\xb9\x87ya that is Pu\xe1\xb9\x87dar\xc4\xabk\xc4\x81ksha (lotus-eyed). It is Brahma\xe1\xb9\x87ya, Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u that is\nAchyu\xe1\xb9\xada (the indestructible). He who meditates upon that sole N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a who is\nlatent in all beings, who is the causal Purusha, who is causeless, who is\nParabrahman, the Om, who is without pains and delusion and who is all-\npervading--that person is never subject to pains. From the dual, he becomes\nthe fearless non-dual. Whoever sees this (world) as manifold (with the\ndifferences of I, you, he, etc.), passes from death to death. In the centre of\nthe heart-lotus is Brahman, which is the All, which has Pr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81 as Its eye and\nwhich is established in Praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na 3 alone. To creatures,\n\np. 38\n\n[paragraph continues] Praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is the eye and Pr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81 is the seat. It is\nPraj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na alone that is Brahman. A person who meditates (thus), leaves this\nworld through Praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and ascending attains all his desires in the\nSupreme Swarga deathless. Oh! I pray Thee, place me in that nectar-everflowing\nunfailing world where Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis (the light) always shines and where one is\nrevered. (There is no doubt) he attains nectar also. Om-nama\xe1\xb8\xa5.\n\nI am without M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81. I am without compare. I am solely the thing that is of the\nnature of wisdom. I am without Aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra (I-am-ness). I am without the\ndifference of the universe, J\xc4\xabva and \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bwara. I am the Supreme that is not\ndifferent from Pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (individual \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81). I am with ordinances and\nprohibitions destroyed without remainder. I am with \xc4\x80\xc5\x9bramas (observances of\nlife) well given up. I am of the nature of the vast and all-full wisdom. I am\none that is witness and without desire. I reside in My glory alone. I am\nwithout motion. I am without old age--without destruction--without the\ndifferences of My party or another. I have wisdom as chief essence. I am the\nmere ocean of bliss called salvation. I am the subtle. I am without change. I\nam \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 merely, without the illusion of qualities. I am the Seat devoid of the\nthree Gu\xe1\xb9\x87as. I am the cause of the many worlds in (My) stomach. I am the\nK\xc5\xabtas\xe1\xb9\xadha-Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya (supreme Cosmic-mind). I am of the form of the Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis\n(light) free from motion. I am not one that can be known by inference. I alone\nam full. I am of the form of the stainless salvation. I am without limbs or\nbirth. I am the essence which is Sa\xe1\xb9\xad itself. I am of the nature of the true\nwisdom without limit. I am the state of excellent happiness. I am One that\ncannot be differentiated. I am the all-pervading and without stain. I am the\nlimitless and endless Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadwa alone. I am fit to be known through Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada. I am\nthe one fit to be worshipped. I am the heart of all the worlds. I am replete\nwith Supreme Bliss. I am of the nature of happiness, which is Supreme Bliss. I\nam pure, secondless, and eternal. I am devoid of beginning. I am free from the\nthree bodies (gross, subtle, and causal). I am of the nature of wisdom. I am\nthe emancipated One. I have a wondrous form. I am free from impurity.\n\np. 39\n\n[paragraph continues] I am the One latent (in all). I am the equal \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 of\neternal Vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na. I am the refined Supreme Truth. I am of the nature of Wisdom-\nBliss alone.\n\nThough I cognize as the secondless \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 by means of discriminative wisdom and\nreason, yet is found the relation between bondage and salvation. Though to Me\nthe universe is gone, yet it shines as true always. Like the truth in the\n(illusory conception of a) snake, etc., in the rope, so the truth of Brahman\nalone is, and is the substratum on which this universe is playing. Therefore\nthe universe is not. Just as sugar is found permeating all the sugar-juice\n(from which the sugar is extracted), so I am full in the three worlds in the\nform of the non-dual Brahman. Like the bubbles, waves, etc., in the ocean, so\nall beings, from Brahma down to worm, are fashioned in Me; just as the ocean\ndoes not long after the motion of the waves, so to Me, there is no longing\nafter sensual happiness, being Myself of the form of (spiritual) Bliss. Just\nas in a wealthy person the desire for poverty does not arise, so in Me who am\nimmersed in Br\xc4\x81hmic Bliss, the desire for sensual happiness cannot arise. An\nintelligent person who sees both nectar and poison rejects poison; so having\ncognized \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma, I reject those that are not-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. The sun that illuminates the\npot (both within and without) is not destroyed with the destruction of the\npot; so the S\xc4\x81ksh\xc4\xab (witness) that illuminates the body is not destroyed with\nthe destruction of the body. To Me there is no bondage; there is no salvation,\nthere are no books, there is no Guru; for these shine through M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 and I have\ncrossed them and am secondless. Let Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as (vital airs) according to their\nlaws be fluctuating. Let Manas (mind) be blown about by desire. How can pains\naffect Me who am by nature full of Bliss? I have truly known \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. My Aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na\nhas fled away. The egoism of actorship has left Me. There is nothing I should\nyet do. Brahman\'s duties, family, Go\xe1\xb9\xadra (clan), name, beauty, and class--all\nthese belong to the gross body and not to Me who am without any mark (of\nbody). Inertness, love, and joy--these attributes appertain to the causal body\nand not to Me, who am eternal and of changeless nature. Just as an owl sees\n\np. 40\n\ndarkness only in the sun, so a fool sees only darkness in the self-shining\nSupreme Bliss. Should the clouds screen the eyesight, a fool thinks there is\nno sun; so an embodied person full of Aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na thinks there is no Brahman. Just\nas nectar which is other than poison does not commingle with it, so I, who am\ndifferent from inert matter, do not mix with its stains. As the light of a\nlamp, however small, dispels immense darkness, so wisdom, however slight,\nmakes Aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, however immense, to perish. Just as (the delusion) of the\nserpent does not exist in the rope in all the three periods of time (past,\npresent, and future), so the universe from Aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra (down) to body does not\nexist in Me who am the non-dual One. Being of the nature of Consciousness\nalone, there is not inertness in Me. Being of the nature of Truth, there is\nnot non-truth to Me. Being of the nature of Bliss, there is not sorrow in Me.\nIt is through Aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na that the universe shines as truth.\n\nWhoever recites this \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmabo\xe1\xb8\x8dha-Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d for a Muh\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb9\xada (48 minutes) is not\nborn again--yea, is not born again.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[37:1](tmu09.htm#fr_12) This Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d treats of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmic instruction.\n\n[37:2](tmu09.htm#fr_13) The three symbols stand for \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81sa, Manas, and Bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi.\n\n[37:3](tmu09.htm#fr_14) In the M\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87d\xc5\xabkya Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d, Pr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81 is said to be the\nJ\xc4\xabva in the third state and Praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is its attribute. Praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is Prakarsha\nJ\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na or special wisdom, _viz_., of looking over the past and the future.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8.
