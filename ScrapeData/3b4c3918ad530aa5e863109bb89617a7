[1](ry138.htm#fn_334)  \n   Ah me, that I should long to set  \n     My eager eyes to-day  \n   On Raghu\'s son, and he be yet  \n     With Lakshman far away!\'  \n   Thus he of lofty glory wailed,  \n     And sank upon the bed.  \n   Beneath the woe his spirit failed,  \n     And all his senses fled.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[164:1](ry137.htm#fr_333) \'So in Homer the horses of Achilles lamented with\nmany bitter tears the death of Patroclus slain by Hector:  \n"\xe1\xbc\xbd\xcf\x80\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xb9 \xce\xb4\xe1\xbe\xbd \xce\x91\xe1\xbc\xb0\xce\xb1\xce\xba\xce\xaf\xce\xb4\xce\xb1\xce\xbf, \xce\xbc\xce\xac\xcf\x87\xce\xb7\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\x80\xcf\x80\xce\xac\xce\xbd\xce\xb5\xcf\x85\xce\xb8\xce\xb5\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\x90\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xcf\x82,  \n\xce\x9a\xce\xbb\xe1\xbe\xb6\xce\xb9\xce\xbf\xce\xbd, \xe1\xbc\x90\xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb4 \xcf\x80\xcf\x81\xe1\xbf\xb6\xcf\x84\xce\xb1 \xcf\x80\xcf\x85\xce\xb8\xce\xad\xcf\x83\xce\xb8\xce\xb7\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\xa1\xce\xbd\xce\xb9\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x87\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xce\xbf  \n\xe1\xbc\x98\xce\xbd \xce\xba\xce\xbf\xce\xbd\xce\xaf\xe1\xbf\x83\xcf\x83\xce\xb9 \xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xcf\x83\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbd\x91\xcf\x86\xe1\xbe\xbd \xe1\xbc\x9d\xce\xba\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\x80\xce\xbd\xce\xb4\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x86\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xce\xbf."  \n                                            ILIAD.
