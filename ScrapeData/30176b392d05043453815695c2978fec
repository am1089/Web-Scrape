Naraya _n_ a said :-- Ja _t_ hara and Devakuta are the two mountains\nsituated on the east of Sumeru; their dimensions towards the north are\neighteen thousand Yoyanas wide and two thousand Yoyanas high. On the west of\nMeru, are situated the two famous lofty mountains Pavamana and Pariyatra;\ntheir length and height are well known. On the south of Meru are situated the\ntwo lofty mountains Kailasa and Karavira. On the north, again, of the Sumeru\nmountain, are situated the mountains S'ri _n_ gagiri and Makaragiri. Thus the\ngolden Sumeru mountain, shines like the Sun, surrounded by these eight\nmountains. In the centre of the Sumeru, there is a Divine city built of the\nCreator Brahma, ten thousand Yoyanas in dimensions. The learned sages that\nknow everything from the highest to the lowest, describe that as square in\ndimensions and all made of gold. On the top of the Sumeru, are situated the\nworld known eight golden cities, subservient to the Brahmapuri, for the eight\nLokapalas. The Lords of the four directions, east, west, north and south and\nof the four corners, north-east, north-west, south-west, south-east, occupy\nthese. The dimensions of each of these eight cities are two thousand Yoyanas\nand a half. In fact, there are nine cities there including the Brahmapuri. Now\nhear the names of these nine cities in due order. The First is Manovati, the\nsecond is Amaravati, the third is Tejovati, next come in order Samyamani, Kri\n_sn_ angana, S'raddhavati, Gandhavati, and Mahodaya, the ninth is Yas'ovati.\nThe Lords of the Puris are Brahma, Indra, Fire and the other Dikpalas in due\norder. When Vi _sn_ u Bhagavan assumed the Tri Vikrama Form in His Dwarf\nIncarnation and went at the sacrifice, to get back the Kingdom of the Heavens\nfrom the demon Vali, there was created one hole or cavity over this Brahma\n_nd_ a Ka _t_ aha (skull) by the nails of the toes of that foot that went up\ntowards his left; and through that cavity, the famous river Bhagavati Ganga\nflowed on the top of those heavenly Kingdoms, the clear waters of which are\never ready to destroy the sins of the whole people. For this reason, She is\nknown in the three Lokas as the Vi _sn_ upadi manifested. This took place long\nlong ago, many thousand Yugas ago, a period difficult to determine. The Ganges\nfell first on the top of the Indra's Heavens, near the place called Vi _sn_\nudhama, known in the three worlds. Here the pure-souled Dhruva, the son of\nUttanapada, observed within his heart the lotus-feet\n\n\n\np. 755\n\n\n\nof Sri Vi _sn_ u Bhagavan and exists still there taking refuge on that\nimmoveable position. There the high-souled Seven Ri _s_ is, knowing the\nhighest purifying influence of the Ganges, circumambulate the river, wishing\nfor the welfare of all the Lokas. This is the great place where one gets\nsuccess, and final liberation, the success-giving place of the ascetics and\nwhere the Munis with clots of hairs on their heads daily take their dip in the\nGanges with the greatest pleasure and admiration. The Ganges flows thence from\nthe Dhruva Man _d_ ala, the abode of Vi _sn_ u, in Ko _t_ is and Ko _t_ is of\nDivine Channels, interspersed with many Vimanas or carriages, deluges the Chan\n_d_ ra Ma _nd_ ala (the Moon Sphere), comes gradually to the Brahma Loka. Here\nShe is divided into the four channels, Sita, Alakananda, Bhadra, and\nChaturbhadra and irrigating many countries, mountains, and forests ultimately\nfalls in the oceans. The Sita, the famous Dhara, purifying all, while falling\ndown from the Brahmaloka, passes round the mountains that form as it were the\nfilaments of the flower-like Sumeru mountain, and falls on the top of the\nGandhamadana range. Thence She, worshipped by the Devas, irrigates the\nBhadras'vavar _s_ a and falls eastward into the salt ocean. The second Dhara\n(stream), named Chak _s_ u, getting out of the Malyavan range, gradually gains\nstrength and assumes great force and flows by Ketumalavar _s_ a to the western\nocean. The third Dhara (stream), the very pure Alakananda, getting out of the\nBrahma Loka, passes through the Girikuta mountain and other forests, falls to\nHemakuta; next She flows through the Bharata Var _s_ a and meets with the\nsouthern ocean. No words can describe the glory and the purifying effect of\nthis river; suffice it to say that those who march out to bathe in this river\nget at each of their steps, the fruits of doing the great sacrifices, Rajasuya\nand As'vamedha, etc. The fourth Dhara of the Trailokyapavani Ganga Devi, named\nBhadra, falling from the mountain S'ri _n_ gavan, become swift and capacious,\nflows by the Northern Kuru country and satisfying the people there flows down\ninto the ocean. Many other rivers, getting out from the mountains, Meru,\nMandara and others, flow through the various Var _s_ as or continents, but of\nall the Var _s_ as, continents, this Bharata Var _s_ a is called the Karma K\n_s_ ettra (or the field of actions). The other eight Var _s_ as, though on\nearth, give the pleasures of the Heavens. The reason for this is that when the\nperiod of the persons\xc2\x92 enjoyments in the Heavens cease, they come and take\ntheir birth in the one or other of these eight Var _s_ as. The people here\nlive for ten thousand years; their body is hard like thunderbolt and all are\nendowed with powers of Ayuta elephants. No one is satisfied with a little of\nthe pleasures of sexes; so all men live happily with their wives, etc. It is\nnot that the males alone are so happy; the females also are\n\n\n\np. 756\n\n\n\nfull of youth throughout their lives and become pregnant, when they are less\nthan one year old. In short, the inhabitants of the Var _s_ as enjoy for ever\nas the persons of Treta Yuga do.\n\n\n\nHear ends the Seventh Chapter of the Eighth Book on the story of the Ganges\nand the continents in Sri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Puranam, of 18,000\nverses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 8](bk08ch08.htm)\n\n"
