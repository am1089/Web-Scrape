And there is question and explanation relative to three things only (not\nto the pradhana).\n\nTo the same conclusion we are led by the consideration of the circumstance\nthat the Ka _th_ avalli-upanishad brings forward, as subjects of discussion,\nonly three things, viz. the fire sacrifice, the individual soul, and the\nhighest Self. These three things only Yama explains, bestowing thereby the\nboons he had granted, and to them only the questions of Na _k_ iketas refer.\nNothing else is mentioned or enquired\n\np. 248\n\nabout. The question relative to the fire sacrifice is contained in the passage\n(Ka. Up. I, 1, 13), 'Thou knowest, O Death, the fire sacrifice which leads us\nto Heaven; tell it to me, who am full of faith.' The question as to the\nindividual soul is contained in I, 1, 20, 'There is that doubt when a man is\ndead, some saying, he is; others, he is not. This I should like to know,\ntaught by thee; this is the third of my boons.' And the question about the\nhighest Self is asked in the passage (I, 2, 14), 'That which thou seest as\nneither this nor that, as neither effect nor cause, as neither past nor\nfuture, tell me that.'--The corresponding answers are given in I, 1, 15, 'Yama\nthen told him that fire sacrifice, the beginning of all the worlds, and what\nbricks are required for the altar, and how many;' in the passage met with\nconsiderably later on (II, 5, 6; 7), 'Well then, O Gautama, I shall tell thee\nthis mystery, the old Brahman and what happens to the Self after reaching\ndeath. Some enter the womb in order to have a body as organic beings, others\ngo into inorganic matter according to their work and according to their\nknowledge;' and in the passage (I, 2, 18), 'The knowing Self is not born nor\ndoes it die,' &c.; which latter passage dilates at length on the highest Self.\nBut there is no question relative to the pradhana, and hence no opportunity\nfor any remarks on it.\n\nHere the Sa _n_ khya advances a new objection. Is, he asks, the question\nrelative to the Self which is asked in the passage, 'There is that doubt when\na man is dead,' &c., again resumed in the passage, 'That which thou seest as\nneither this nor that,' &c, or does the latter passage raise a distinct new\nquestion? If the former, the two questions about the Self coalesce into one,\nand there are therefore altogether two questions only, one relative to the\nfire sacrifice, the other relative to the Self. In that case the Sutra has no\nright to speak of questions and explanations relating to three subjects.--If\nthe latter, you do not consider it a mistake to assume a question in excess of\nthe number of boons granted, and can therefore not object to us if we assume\nan explanation about the pradhana in excess of the number of questions asked.\n\np. 249\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--We by no means assume a question in\nexcess of the number of boons granted, being prevented from doing so by the\ninfluence of the opening part of that syntactical whole which constitutes the\nKa _th_ avalli-upanishad. The Upanishad starts with the topic of the boons\ngranted by Yama, and all the following part of the Upanishad--which is thrown\ninto the form of a colloquy of Yama and Na _k_ iketas--carries on that topic\nup to the very end. Yama grants to Na _k_ iketas, who had been sent by his\nfather, three boons. For his first boon Na _k_ iketas chooses kindness on the\npart of his father towards him, for his second boon the knowledge of the fire\nsacrifice, for his third boon the knowledge of the Self. That the knowledge of\nthe Self is the third boon appears from the indication contained in the\npassage (I, 1, 20), 'There is that doubt--; this is the third of my boons.'--\nIf we therefore supposed that the passage, 'That which thou seest as neither\nthis nor that,' &c., raises a new question, we should thereby assume a\nquestion in excess of the number of boons granted, and thus destroy the\nconnexion of the entire Upanishad.--But-the Sa _n_ khya will perhaps interpose\n--it must needs be admitted that the passage last quoted does raise a new\nquestion, because the subject enquired about is a new one. For the former\nquestion refers to the individual soul, as we conclude from the doubt\nexpressed in the words, 'There is that doubt when a man is dead--some saying,\nhe is; others, he is not.' Now this individual soul, as having definite\nattributes, &c., cannot constitute the object of a question expressed in such\nterms as, 'This which thou seest as neither this nor that,' &c.; the highest\nSelf, on the other hand, may be enquired about in such terms, since it is\nabove all attributes. The appearance of the two questions is, moreover, seen\nto differ; for the former question refers to existence and non-existence,\nwhile the latter is concerned with an entity raised above all definite\nattributes, &c. Hence we conclude that the latter question, in which the\nformer one cannot be recognised, is a separate question, and does not merely\nresume the subject of the former one.--All this argumentation is not valid, we\nreply, since we maintain the unity of the highest Self and the\n\np. 250\n\nindividual Self. If the individual Self were different from the highest Self,\nwe should have to declare that the two questions are separate independent\nquestions, but the two are not really different, as we know from other\nscriptural passages, such as 'Thou art that.' And in the Upanishad under\ndiscussion also the answer to the question, 'That which thou seest as neither\nthis nor that,' viz. the passage, 'The knowing Self is not born, it dies not'\n--which answer is given in the form of a denial of the birth and death of the\nSelf-clearly shows that the embodied Self and the highest Self are non-\ndifferent. For there is room for a denial of something only when that\nsomething is possible, and the possibility of birth and death exists in the\nembodied Self only, since it is connected with the body, but not in the\nhighest Self.--There is, moreover, another passage conveying the same meaning,\nviz. II, 4, 4, 'The wise when he knows that that by which he perceives all\nobjects in sleep or in waking, is the great omnipresent Self, grieves no\nmore.' This passage makes the cessation of all grief dependent on the\nknowledge of the individual Self, in so far as it possesses the qualities of\ngreatness and omnipresence, and thereby declares that the individual Self is\nnot different from the highest Self. For that the cessation of all sorrow is\nconsequent on the knowledge of the highest Self, is a recognised Vedanta\ntenet.--There is another passage also warning men not to look on the\nindividual Self and the highest Self as different entities, viz. II, 4, 10,\n'What is here the same is there; and what is there the same is here. He who\nsees any difference here goes from death to death.'--The following\ncircumstance, too, is worthy of consideration. When Na _k_ iketas has asked\nthe question relating to the existence or non-existence of the soul after\ndeath, Yama tries to induce him to choose another boon, tempting him with the\noffer of various objects of desire. But Na _k_ iketas remains firm. Thereupon\nDeath, dwelling on the distinction of the Good and the Pleasant, and the\ndistinction of wisdom and ignorance, praises Na _k_ iketas, 'I believe Na _k_\niketas to be one who desires knowledge, for even many pleasures did not tear\nthee away' (I, 2, 4); and later on praises the question\n\np. 251\n\nasked by Na _k_ iketas, 'The wise who, by means of meditation on his Self,\nrecognises the Ancient who is difficult to be seen, who has entered into the\ndark, who is hidden in the cave, who dwells in the abyss, as God, he indeed\nleaves joy and sorrow far behind' (I, 2, 12). Now all this means to intimate\nthat the individual Self and the highest Self are non-different. For if Na _k_\niketas set aside the question, by asking which he had earned for himself the\npraise of Yama, and after having received that praise asked a new question,\nall that praise would have been bestowed on him unduly. Hence it follows that\nthe question implied in I, 2, 14, 'That which thou seest as neither this nor\nthat,' merely resumes the topic to which the question in I, 1, 20 had\nreferred.--Nor is there any basis to the objection that the two questions\ndiffer in form. The second question, in reality, is concerned with the same\ndistinction as the first. The first enquires about the existence of the soul\napart from the body, &c.; the second refers to the circumstance of that soul\nnot being subject to sa _m_ sara. For as long as Nescience remains, so long\nthe soul is affected with definite attributes, &c.; but as soon as Nescience\ncomes to an end, the soul is one with the highest Self, as is taught by such\nscriptural texts as 'Thou art that.' But whether Nescience be active or\ninactive, no difference is made thereby in the thing itself (viz. the soul). A\nman may, in the dark, mistake a piece of rope lying on the ground for a snake,\nand run away from it, frightened and trembling; thereon another man may tell\nhim, 'Do not be afraid, it is only a rope, not a snake;' and he may then\ndismiss the fear caused by the imagined snake, and stop running. But all the\nwhile the presence and subsequent absence of his erroneous notion, as to the\nrope being a snake, make no difference whatever in the rope itself. Exactly\nanalogous is the case of the individual soul which is in reality one with the\nhighest soul, although Nescience makes it appear different. Hence the reply\ncontained in the passage, 'It is not born, it dies not,' is also to be\nconsidered as furnishing an answer to the question asked in I, 1, 20.--The\nSutra is to be understood with reference to the distinction of the individual\nSelf and the highest Self which\n\np. 252\n\nresults from Nescience. Although the question relating to the Self is in\nreality one only, yet its former part (I, 1, 20) is seen specially to refer to\nthe individual Self, since there a doubt is set forth as to the existence of\nthe soul when, at the time of death, it frees itself from the body, and since\nthe specific marks of the sa _m_ sara-state, such as activity, &c. are not\ndenied; while the latter part of the question (I, 2, 14), where the state of\nbeing beyond all attributes is spoken of, clearly refers to the highest Self.\n--For these reasons the Sutra is right in assuming three topics of question\nand explanation, viz. the fire sacrifice, the individual soul, and the highest\nSelf. Those, on the other hand, who assume that the pradhana constitutes a\nfourth subject discussed in the Upanishad, can point neither to a boon\nconnected with it, nor to a question, nor to an answer. Hence the pradhana\nhypothesis is clearly inferior to our own.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 7](sbe34118.htm)\n\n"
