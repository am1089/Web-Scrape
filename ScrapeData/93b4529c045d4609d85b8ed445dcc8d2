The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n7\\. Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a or Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya Puran\xcc\x81a. "That Puran\xcc\x81a in which, commencing\nwith the story of the birds that were acquainted with right and wrong, every\nthing is narrated fully by Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, as it was explained by holy sages in\nreply to the question of the Muni, is called the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, containing nine\nthousand verses 55." This is so called from its\n\np. xxxiv\n\nbeing in the first instance narrated by Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya Muni, and in the second\nplace by certain fabulous birds; thus far agreeing with the account given of\nit in the Matsya. That, as well as other authorities, specify its containing\nnine thousand stanzas; but my copy closes with a verse affirming that the\nnumber of verses recited by the Muni was six thousand nine hundred; and a copy\nin the East India Company\'s library has a similar specification. The\ntermination is, however, somewhat abrupt, and there is no reason why the\nsubject with which it ends should not have been carried on farther. One copy\nin the Company\'s library, indeed, belonging to the Guicowar\'s collection,\nstates at the close that it is the end of the first Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, or section. If\nthe Puran\xcc\x81a was ever completed, the remaining portion of it appears to be\nlost.\n\nJaimini, the pupil of Vyasa, applies to Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya to be made acquainted\nwith the nature of Vasudeva, and for an explanation of some of the incidents\ndescribed in the Mahabharata; with the ambrosia of which divine poem, Vyasa he\ndeclares has watered the whole world: a reference which establishes the\npriority of the Bharata to the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya Puran\xcc\x81a, however incompatible this\nmay be with the tradition, that having finished the Puran\xcc\x81as, Vyasa wrote the\npoem.\n\nMarkan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya excuses himself, saying he has a religious rite to perform; and\nhe refers Jaimini to some very sapient birds, who reside in the Vindhya\nmountains; birds of a celestial origin, found, when just born, by the Muni\n\xc5\x9aamika, on the field of Kurukshetra, and brought up by him along with his\nscholars: in consequence of which, and by virtue of their heavenly descent,\nthey became profoundly versed in the Vedas, and a knowledge of spiritual\ntruth. This machinery is borrowed from the Mahabharata, with some\nembellishment. Jaimini accordingly has recourse to the birds, Pingaksha and\nhis brethren, and puts to them the questions he had asked of the Muni. "Why\nwas Vasudeva born as a mortal? How was it that Draupadi was the wife of the\nfive Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81us? Why did Baladeva do penance for Brahmanicide? and why were the\nchildren of Draupadi destroyed, when they had Krishn\xcc\x81a and Arjuna to defend\nthem?" The answers to these inquiries occupy a number of chapters, and form a\nsort of supplement to the Mahabharata; supplying,\n\np. xxxv\n\npartly by invention, perhaps, and partly by reference to equally ancient\nauthorities, the blanks left in some of its narrations.\n\nLegends of Vritrasura\'s death, Baladeva\'s penance, Hari\xc5\x9bchandra\'s elevation to\nheaven, and the quarrel between Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha and Viswamitra, are followed by a\ndiscussion respecting birth, death, and sin; which leads to a more extended\ndescription of the different hells than is found in other Puran\xcc\x81as. The\naccount of creation which is contained in this work is repeated by the birds\nafter Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya\'s account of it to Krosht\xcc\x81uki, and is confined to the\norigin of the Vedas and patriarchal families, amongst whom are new characters,\nas Duhsaha and his wife Marsht\xcc\x81i, and their descendants; allegorical\npersonages, representing intolerable iniquity and its consequences. There is\nthen a description of the world, with, as usual to this Puran\xcc\x81a, several\nsingularities, some of which are noticed in the following pages. This being\nthe state of the world in the Swayambhuva Manwantara, an account of the other\nManwantaras succeeds, in which the births of the Manus, and a number of other\nparticulars, are peculiar to this work. The present or Vaivaswata Manwantara\nis very briefly passed over; but the next, the first of the future\nManwantaras, contains the long episodical narrative of the actions of the\ngoddess Durga, which is the especial boast of this Puran\xcc\x81a, and is the text-\nbook of the worshippers of Kali, Chan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81i, or Durga, in Bengal. It is the\nChan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81i Patha, or Durga Mahatmya, in which the victories of the goddess over\ndifferent evil beings, or Asuras, are detailed with considerable power and\nspirit. It is read daily in the temples of Durga, and furnishes the pomp and\ncircumstance of the great festival of Bengal, the Durga puja, or public\nworship of that goddess 56.\n\nAfter the account of the Manwantaras is completed, there follows a series of\nlegends, some new, some old, relating to the sun and his posterity; continued\nto Vaivaswata Manu and his sons, and their immediate descendants; terminating\nwith Dama, the son of Narishyanta 57. Of most of the persons noticed, the work\nnarrates particulars not found elsewhere.\n\np. xxxvi\n\nThis Puran\xcc\x81a has a character different from that of all the others. It has\nnothing of a sectarial spirit, little of a religious tone, rarely inserting\nprayers and invocations to any deity, and such as are inserted are brief and\nmoderate. It deals little in precepts, ceremonial or moral. Its leading\nfeature is narrative, and it presents an uninterrupted succession of legends,\nmost of which, when ancient, are embellished with new circumstances; and when\nnew, partake so far of the spirit of the old, that they are disinterested\ncreations of the imagination, having no particular motive; being designed to\nrecommend no special doctrine or observance. Whether they are derived from any\nother source, or whether they are original inventions, it is not possible to\nascertain. They are most probably, for the greater part at least, original;\nand the whole has been narrated in the compiler\'s own manner, a manner\nsuperior to that of the Puran\xcc\x81as in general, with exception of the Bhagavata.\n\nIt is not easy to conjecture a date for this Puran\xcc\x81a: it is subsequent to the\nMahabharata, but how long subsequent is doubtful. It is unquestionably more\nancient than such works as the Brahma, Padma, and Naradiya Puran\xcc\x81as; and its\nfreedom from sectarial bias is a reason for supposing it anterior to the\nBhagavata. At the same time, its partial conformity to the definition of a\nPuran\xcc\x81a, and the tenor of the additions which it has made to received legends\nand traditions, indicate a not very remote age; and, in the absence of any\nguide to a more positive conclusion, it may conjecturally be placed in the\nninth or tenth century.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xxxiii:55](vp011.htm#fr_54) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_03300.jpg)\n\n[xxxv:56](vp011.htm#fr_55) A translation into English by a Madras Pandit,\nKavali Venkata Ramaswami, was published at Calcutta in 1823.\n\n[xxxv:57](vp011.htm#fr_56) See Vishn\xcc\x81u P., p. 253. n. 22.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8.
