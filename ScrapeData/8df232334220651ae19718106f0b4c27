 \nWhat, warrior's arm with hermit's zeal?  \nWe with such might have naught to do:  \nThe forest rule should guide us too.  \nBut when Ayodhya hails thee lord,  \nBe then thy warrior life restored:  \nSo shall thy sire  1 and mother joy  \nIn bliss that naught may e'er destroy.  \nAnd if, resigning empire, thou  \nSubmit thee to the hermit's vow,  \nThe noblest gain from virtue springs,  \nAnd virtue joy unending brings.  \nAll earthly blessings virtue sends:  \nOn virtue all the world depends.  \nThose who with vow and fasting tame  \nTo due restraint the mind and frame,  \nWin by their labour, nobly wise,  \nThe highest virtue for their prize.  \nPure in the hermit's grove remain,  \nTrue to thy duty, free from stain.  \nBut the three worlds are open thrown  \nTo thee, by whom all things are known.  \nWho gave me power that I should dare  \nHis duty to my lord declare?  \n'Tis woman's fancy, light as air,  \n   That moves my foolish breast.  \nNow with thy brother counsel take,  \nReflect, thy choice with judgment make,  \n   And do what seems the best.'  \n\np. 239  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[238:1](ry207.htm#fr_423) Gorresio observes that Das'aratha was dead and that\nSita had been informed of his death. In his translation he substitutes for the\nwords of the text 'thy relations and mine.' This is quite superfluous.\nDas'aratha though in heaven still took a loving interest in the fortunes of\nhis son.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto X.: Rama's Reply.](ry208.htm)\n\n"
