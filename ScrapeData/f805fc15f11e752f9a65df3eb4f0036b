Vyasa said :-- After paying due respects to his new son-in-law, the king\nSubahu cheerfully entertained him for six days with variety of good dishes.\n\n\n\n2\\. Thus finishing off the marriage ceremony, the king after consulting with\nhis ministers, presented the bridegroom and the bride various jewels and\nornaments and other things given naturally on marriage occasions.\n\n\n\n3\\. Then the king of Benares, of brilliant splendour, heard from his\nmessengers that the kings had obstructed the way back of Sudars\xc2\x92ana and became\nvery absent minded.\n\n\n\n4\\. Then Sudars\xc2\x92ana, of firm resolve, told his father-in-law \xc2\x93O king! better\nnow give us order that we may depart. We will go without any fear.\n\n\n\n5\\. O king! First we will halt at the holy hermitage of Bharadvaja Muni; and\nnext we will, after due considerations, settle where we would go.\n\n\n\n6\\. O pure one! You need not fear a bit from these kings; the Mother of the\nUniverse, the Bhagavati Bhavani will surely protect us.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n7\\. Vyasa said :-- O king Janamejaya! Hearing thus his son-in-law\xc2\x92s orders,\nthe king Subahu gave him a vast amount of wealth and bade good-bye to him.\nSudars\xc2\x92ana, too, quickly departed.\n\n\n\n8\\. The king Subahu followed him with a Iong train of soldiers. Thus\nSudars\xc2\x92ana went on, in his journey, fearless.\n\n\n\n9\\. The great hero Sudars\xc2\x92ana, the descendant of Raghu, with his new consort\nin the chariot and followed by many other chariots, saw the soldiers of the\nseveral kings.\n\n\n\np. 214\n\n\n\n10\\. The king Subahu, seeing them, became anxious. But Sudars\xc2\x92ana, gladly took\nrefuge, with his whole heart, of the all-auspicious Goddess S\xc2\x92ankari.\n\n\n\n11\\. Sudars\xc2\x92ana began to recite silently the excellent one word seed mantra of\nthe King of Desires (Kamaraja) and, out of its power, he and his wife remained\nin the chariot without any fear and sorrow.\n\n\n\n12\\. Then all the kings came there with their soldiers to fight with\nSudars\xc2\x92ana and to carry away by force the bride. Thus a loud uproar arose.\n\n\n\n13\\. The king of Benares seeing them wanted to kill them. But Sudars\xc2\x92ana, the\ndescent of Raghu, desirous of victory, repeatedly asked him not do so.\n\n\n\n14\\. Loud arose, then, the uproar, caused by the sounds of conchshells,\nbherri, and war drums of the kings on one side and Subahu on the other, each\nof the two parties determining to extirpate the other.\n\n\n\n15\\. S\xc2\x92atrujit prepared himself for the war to destroy his enemy. Yudhajit\ncame there for his help, well equipped with army, etc.\n\n\n\n16-17. Some warrior kings remained there as witnesses with their soldiers.\nThen Yudhajit went in front of Sudars\xc2\x92ana. His younger brother S\xc2\x92atrujit, too,\nattended Yudhajit to kill his brother in the battle field. Then the warriors,\noverpowered with anger, shot each other with arrows.\n\n\n\n18\\. A great encounter then ensued in the battle field with sharp arrows. The\nking of Benares hurriedly advanced there, with a great body of army, to\nrelieve his son-in-law.\n\n\n\n19\\. Thus when the dreadful war began to grow more and more horrible, the\nGoddess Bhagavati suddenly appeared there, mounted on Her lion.\n\n\n\n20-21. The beauty of Her body was exceedingly lovely; She was adorned with\nvarious excellent ornaments and She held various weapons. She wore divine\nclothings and the beautiful Mandara garland suspended from Her neck up to Her\nknees. The kings were greatly astonished to see Her. They began to argue \xc2\x93Who\nin this Lady, mounted on a lion? Whence has She so suddenly come?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n22-23. Beholding Her, Sudars\xc2\x92ana told the king of Benares \xc2\x93O king! Behold! The\nDivine Maha Devi has come here to favour us. She is very merciful. Now I am\ncompletely fearless.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n24\\. Sudars\xc2\x92ana and Subahu were highly delighted to see the Beautiful Goddess\nand bowed down to Her feet with great devotion.\n\n\n\n25\\. Then the lion, the vehicle of the Goddess, roared, making tremendous\nnoise. Hearing the roaring of the lion, all the elephants trembled. At that\n\n\n\np. 215\n\n\n\ntime, the winds began to blow violently and the four quarters assumed an awful\nappearance.\n\n\n\n26-27. Then Sudars\xc2\x92ana told his general to carry soon his forces where the\nkings were staying, blocking his way. \xc2\x93What could the vicious kings do now,\nthough they had become very angry? The Goddess Bhagavati had come there to\nsave us.\n\n\n\n28\\. Now you all go safely and calmly through the midst of the kings. See! At\nmy remembering Her, She has come here mercifully to save us.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n29-30. The general, on hearing these words, became ready to march by that\nroute. Then Yudhajit, very much infuriated with anger, said to all the kings\n:-- \xc2\x93Why are you all so much fear stricken? Kill this Sudars\xc2\x92ana, stealing\naway this girl.\n\n\n\n31\\. This lad, weak and without any support, will carry away by force and\nfearlessly the girl, spiting all the kings; and won\xc2\x92t you be able to do\nanything? This is very strange!\n\n\n\n32\\. Are you afraid to see this one lady on a lion? O high minded kings! Never\ntrifle away this boy; kill him with all attention.\n\n\n\n33\\. Killing him, we will then take away this girl. The jackal can never\nsnatch away the lady under the grasp of a lion.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n34\\. Thus saying, the king Yudhajit, filled with anger, came to the battle\nfield with S\xc2\x92atrujit and all his forces.\n\n\n\n35-36. That wicked king, drew his bow string well nigh to his ear and shot\narrows after arrows, sharpened under stone and by blacksmith at Sudars\xc2\x92ana,\nwith the object of killing him. Sudars\xc2\x92ana cut off all those arrows quickly\nwith his own quick going arrows.\n\n\n\n37\\. Thus when the fight grew intense, the Goddess Chandika became very mach\nenraged and shot arrows at Yudhajit.\n\n\n\n38\\. Assuming diverse forms, the Goddess Durga, holding various weapons the\nauspicious Mother of the Universe, began to fight terribly in the battle\nfield.\n\n\n\n39\\. S\xc2\x92atrujit and the king Yudhajit were killed in that terrible battle. Both\nof them fell dead from their chariots; and a shout of victory arose from the\nside of Sudars\xc2\x92an.\n\n\n\n40\\. The uncle and cousin of the king Subahu were on the side of Yudhajit and\nwere killed. The kings were very much astonished to see them thus lying dead.\n\n\n\n41\\. The king Subahu, seeing them dead in the battlefield became very glad and\nbegan to praise and sing hymns in honour of Durga Devi the Destroyer of all\ndifficulties.\n\n\n\np. 216\n\n\n\n42-43. I bow to the auspicious Goddess Jagaddhatri, again and again; I bow to\nthe Bhagavati Durga the bestower of all desires; I always bow down to Her Who\nis auspicious, peace giving, and the Higher Vidya. O Mother! O Giver of\nsalvation! O Auspicious One! You are pervading the whole Universe, O World\nMother! and Upholder of the Universe! I bow down to Thee.\n\n\n\n44\\. O World-mother! O Devi! you are devoid of Prakritic qualities; you are\nfull of qualities; beyond mind and speech; one cannot think out your prowess,\netc., by one\xc2\x92s mind. Mother! you are the Highest Force; ever willing to\ndestroy the miseries of your devoted persons. Your influence is manifest\neverywhere; what eulogy can I sing of Thee.\n\n\n\n45\\. O Devi! You are the Goddess of Vak (speech) of all beings; you are the\nall pervading intelligence, mind, effort, and movements; you are the\ncontroller of the minds of all; therefore how can I praise You? O Goddess; You\nare the Self of all; how can I sing eulogies to You, who are beyond speech and\nmind, and to the Universal Self.\n\n\n\n46\\. Brahma, Hari and Hara and other higher Devas have not been able to find\nthe limits of your qualities, though they are incessantly chanting your\npraises; O Goddess! I am the small of the smallest, I am without\nqualification, and bound by Prakritic qualities; I am ignorant as regards Jiva\nand Brahma. O Mother! I will never be able to describe Your characteristics\nthat are unfathomable.\n\n\n\n47\\. O Mother! why not good companionships effect the fulfilment of one\xc2\x92s\ndesires. The purification of my heart has been effected incidentally. O\nMother! my son-in-law is wholly devoted to you; accidentally there has arisen\nthe connection between him and me and it is on account of his connection that\nI have been able to see You.\n\n\n\n48\\. O Mother! Today I have got without any restraint and control of passions,\nand samadhi, the rare vision of You, who is wanted to be seen even by Brahma,\nHari and Hara, Indra and the other Devas and by the Munis, who have attained\ntheir realisation. Therefore who is there in this Triloki, that is so\nfortunate as I am.\n\n\n\n49\\. O Bhavani! Where am I, void of intelligence and where is the rare vision\nof You, Who is the only medicine of this disease of the ocean of world? Still,\nO Mother! Who is worshipped by the Devas, I have got Your vision. Now I have\ncome to know that You always show mercy to Your Bhaktas, who are in their\nBhavas (mental images of your Self).\n\n\n\n50\\. O Goddess! You have saved Sudars\xc2\x92an in this great war crisis and You have\nslain these two powerful enemies. How can I describe your\n\n\n\np. 217\n\n\n\nprowess in this matter? This I have understood that Your Holy Character ever\nshows mercy on Your devotees.\n\n\n\n51\\. O Goddess! Again this is not a matter to be wondered at, if one\nconsiders; for You are protecting this whole universe, moving and unmoving;\nand accordingly You have now protected, out of Your mercy, your Bhakta\nSudars\xc2\x92ana, the son of Dhruvasandhi, by killing his enemy.\n\n\n\n52\\. O Bhavani! It is not merely for the protection of your Bhaktas, engaged\nin Your service, that You shew this favour but also to extol the meritorious\ndeeds of your Bhaktas that You do such things; otherwise how is it that this\nBhakta saintlike Sudars\xc2\x92ana, by marrying my daughter, has got victory in this\nbattle field?\n\n\n\n53\\. O Mother! You are fully capable to destroy the fear of birth and death.\nWhat wonder is there that you fulfill the desires of your Bhaktas? The Bhaktas\nextol You by characterising You as Sagu _n_ a (full of qualities), Nirgu _n_ a\n(devoid of any quality) and Apara, beyond all merits and demerits.\n\n\n\n54\\. O Goddess! O Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari! I am fortunate that I have been able to see\nYou, and thus all my duties have become crowned with success. O Mother! I have\nno practices in the shape of Your meditation, etc. nor do I know any seed\nmantras of Yours; today I have fully seen Your glory manifested.\n\n\n\n55\\. Vyasa said :-- Thus extolled by the king Subahu, the Goddess Bhagavati,\nthe Bestower of the Absolute Freedom, was pleased and said \xc2\x93O thou, practiser\nof good vows! Ask boon from Me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus ends the twenty third chapter on the killing of the enemy of Sudars\xc2\x92ana\nin the great war, in S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 24](bk03ch24.htm)\n\n'
