That (opening of) vital air of his which is in front, that,\nforsooth, is the Vai _s_ vanara (graha); and that which is behind is the\nDhruva. Formerly, indeed, both these grahas, the Dhruva and Vai _s_ vanara,\nwere drawn; and even now one of them is still drawn, to wit, the Dhruva 1. And\nif he acquire a knowledge of that (Vai _s_ vanara graha) either from the\nKarakas, or from anywhere else, let him pour it into the sacrificer's cup; but\nthis (Dhruva graha he pours) into the Hot _ri_ 's cup 2.\n\n4:2:4:22\\. Now, what part of him there is below the navel, that part of his\nself, that vital energy of his, is this (Dhruva): hence he draws it by means\nof this (earth), because of her is the bowl (sthali) 3, and with a bowl he\ndraws it;--for undecaying and immortal is this (earth), and undecaying and\nimmortal is the vital energy: therefore he draws it by means of this (earth).\n\np. 299\n\n4:2:4:33\\. He draws it full; for full means all, and the vital energy means\nall: therefore he draws it full.\n\n4:2:4:44\\. He draws it for (Agni) Vai _s_ vanara; for Vai _s_ vanara ('he that\nbelongs to all men') is the year, and the vital energy (life) is the year:\ntherefore he draws it for Vai _s_ vanara.\n\n4:2:4:55\\. Having been drawn at the morning pressing, it reposes apart from\nthat time: thus he guides him (the sacrificer) safely through all the\npressings.\n\n4:2:4:66\\. Let him not pour it (into the Hot _ri_ 's cup) during the chanting;\nfor, verily, were he to pour it out during the chanting, the sacrificer would\nnot live through the year.\n\n4:2:4:77\\. He pours it out during the recitation of the _s_ astra; whereby he\nguides him safely over the twelvefold chant of praise: thus he obtains ever\ncontinued life, and thus does the sacrificer live long. Therefore the Brahman\nshould sit through the praise of Agni (Agnish _t_ oma) 1; till the offering of\nthis (libation) he must not slip away 2\\--nor must he\n\np. 300\n\ndischarge urine: thus he obtains the full life--for this (libation) is his\nlife--thus he reaches the full (measure of) life.\n\n4:2:4:88\\. For, what part of him there is below the navel, that part of his\nself is this (Dhruva libation). Hence were he to slip away or discharge urine\nbefore the offering of this (libation), he would discharge the Dhruva (the\nfirm, constant one): hence, lest he should discharge the Dhruva, he sits\nthrough the praise of Agni. This, indeed, applies only to the sacrificer 1,\nfor this (libation) is part of the sacrificer's self.\n\n4:2:4:99\\. He sits through the praise of Agni 2;--for Soma is glory: hence\nthey both approach, he who partakes of the Soma and he who does not,--they\napproach, forsooth, to behold that glory. And thus indeed the Brahmans, having\ncrept near together, take unto them that glory, when they drink (the\nSoma);--and verily whosoever, knowing this, drinks (Soma), becomes glorious 3\nindeed.\n\n4:2:4:1010\\. Now, those same (priests) having, while gliding along 4,\ndeposited that glory in him who sits through (celebrates) the praise of Agni,\nthey glide along and turn away from that glory 5: having thus encompassed it,\nhe again takes that glory unto himself;--\n\np. 301\n\nverily, whosoever, knowing this, sits through (celebrates) the praise of Agni,\nhe passes away after becoming the most glorious of these (men).\n\n4:2:4:1111\\. Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_\napati, were contending for this sacrifice--their father Pra _g_ apati, the\nyear,--saying, 'Ours he shall be! ours he shall be!'\n\n4:2:4:1212\\. Then the gods went on singing praises and toiling. They devised\nthis Agnish _t_ oma feast, and by means of this Agnish _t_ oma feast they\nappropriated the entire sacrifice and excluded the Asuras from the sacrifice.\nAnd in like manner does this (sacrificer), by means of this Agnish _t_ oma\nfeast, now appropriate the entire sacrifice, and exclude his enemies from the\nsacrifice: therefore he celebrates the Agnish _t_ oma.\n\n4:2:4:1313\\. Having drawn it (the Dhruva graha), he deposits it with the\nnorthern cart 1, lest he should confound the vital airs, for the grahas are\nvital airs: now the other grahas he deposits on the raised (mound), but this\none (he deposits) after pushing (the dust) aside without leaving as much as a\nblade of grass between 2.\n\n4:2:4:1414\\. For those (other cups of Soma) are that part of his body from the\nnavel upwards, and above, as it were, is what is from the navel upwards, and\nabove, as it were, is what is raised: therefore he deposits\n\np. 302\n\n[paragraph continues] (the others) on the raised (mound), and this one (he\ndeposits) after pushing (the dust) aside without leaving as much as a blade of\ngrass between.\n\n4:2:4:1515\\. For this (cup of Soma) is that part of his body from the navel\ndownwards; and below, as it were, is what is from the navel downwards; and\nbelow, as it were, is what (one deposits) after pushing (the dust) aside and\nleaving not so much as a blade of grass between: therefore he deposits this\n(Dhruva graha) after pushing (the dust) aside, without leaving so much as a\nblade of grass between.\n\n4:2:4:1616\\. Now, that sacrifice which is being performed is Pra _g_ apati,\nfrom whom these creatures on earth have been born,--and indeed even now they\nare born after this (sacrifice). The creatures that are born therefrom after\nthose (libations) which he deposits on the raised (mound), stand on this\n(earth) with something different from their own self,--for those which stand\non hoofs indeed stand on this (earth) with something different from their own\nself. And when he deposits this (Dhruva cup) after shifting aside (the dust),\nand not leaving so much as a blade of grass between,--the creatures that are\nborn _th_ ereafter from this (sacrifice), stand on this (earth) with their own\nself, namely, men and wild beasts 1\n\n4:2:4:1717\\. Moreover, on the one hand, in throwing up (the mound) he puts\nupon this (earth) something different from it; and those creatures that are\nborn from this (sacrifice) after those (libations) which he deposits on the\nraised (mound), they stand on this (earth) with something different from their\nown self, namely, with hoofs.\n\np. 303\n\n4:2:4:1818\\. And, on the other hand, they offer in the \xc3\x82havaniya 1 a\nsacrificial cake, parched barley-grains, porridge, sour curds, and clotted\ncurds,--this is like pouring (food) into one's mouth. But this (libation)\nremains apart, (being) of one form like water. Hence while he eats the\nmultiform food with that mouth (the fire), he lets flow from that opening the\nuniform (libation) like water. Then as to why it is called Dhruva.\n\n4:2:4:1919\\. Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were\nafraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. The Asura-Rakshas assailed them\nfrom the south, and overturned those southern cups of Soma,--even that\nsouthern Soma-cart they overturned; but that other (cart) they could not\noverturn: the northern cart then kept the southern cart steady 2. And because\nthey could not overturn that (northern cup) therefore it is called Dhruva\n(firm) 3.\n\n4:2:4:2020\\. They indeed watch over it; for this (cup of Soma) is the head of\nGayatri, Gayatri being the sacrifice,--there are twelve chants (stotra) and\ntwelve recitations ( _s_ astra): that makes twenty-four, and of twenty-four\nsyllables consists the Gayatri. This cup of Soma is her head; but the head\nmeans excellence, for the head indeed means excellence: hence people say of\nhim who is the best man of a place, that 'so and so is the head of such and\nsuch a place.' And, indeed, the best man would come to harm, if this\n\np. 304\n\n[paragraph continues] (cup) were to come to harm; and, the best man being the\nsacrificer, they watch (this cup) lest the sacrificer should come to harm.\n\n4:2:4:2121\\. Moreover, this (graha) is Gayatri's calf, Gayatri being the\nsacrifice,--there are twelve chants and twelve recitations: that makes twenty-\nfour, and of twenty-four syllables consists the Gayatri. This is her\ncalf;--when they watch it, then they watch these calves for the sake of the\nmilking: 'as they yield this milk, even so may this Gayatri yield all the\nsacrificer's wishes,'--this is why they watch it.\n\n4:2:4:2222\\. And when both the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthat _ri_ walk out\n(of the cart-shed) and (afterwards) enter (again) 1, it is as if (a cow) were\nto come with the calf tied to her. They come to this cup of Soma, and he (the\nAdhvaryu) pours it out; whereby he lets loose the Gayatri: 'Made over to the\nsacrificer, may this Gayatri yield all his desires!' for this reason he pours\nit out.\n\n4:2:4:2323\\. He pours it (into the Hot _ri_ 's cup 1) with (Va _g_. S. VII,\n25), 'The firm Soma I pour out--or, I take--with firm mind and speech: now may\nIndra make our people of one mind, free from enemies!' whereby he means to\nsay, 'so that Indra may make these our creatures, the people, of one mind and\nfree from enemies, for their happiness and glory and nourishment!'\n\n4:2:4:2424\\. Here now he draws it from that (stream of Soma) 2, (Va _g_. S.\nVII, 24; Rig-veda VI, 7, 1), 'Agni\n\np. 305\n\n[paragraph continues] Vai _s_ vanara, the crest of heaven, the disposer of the\nearth, born in the sacred rite, the wise all-ruler, the guest of men,--him the\ngods have begotten as a vessel for their mouth. Thou art taken with a support:\nthou art firm (Dhruva), of firm abode, the firmest of the firm, the most\nsolidly founded of the solid! This is thy womb--thee for Vai _s_ vanara!'\ntherewith he deposits it after pushing (the dust) aside, and not leaving so\nmuch as a blade of grass between: for he indeed takes it for (Agni) Vai _s_\nvanara.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[298:1](sbe2648.htm#fr_717) 'Formerly they took these two separately, as\nDhruva and Vai _s_ vanara; but now they take them as one only.' Ka _n_ va\ntext.\n\n[298:2](sbe2648.htm#fr_718) Both these libations are reserved for the evening\nfeast.\n\n[298:3](sbe2648.htm#fr_719) See [p. 288](sbe2645.htm#page_288), note\n[2](sbe2646.htm#fn_696).\n\n[299:1](sbe2648.htm#fr_720) ? Tasmad brahma _n_ o 'gnish _t_ omasat syat. The\nobvious meaning of this sentence is, 'hence the celebrator of the Agnish _t_\noma should be a Brahman,' or, perhaps, 'hence a Brahman should celebrate the\nAgnish _t_ oma;' but I do not see how it can have that meaning here, without\nat least a double-entendre in the term 'agnish _t_ omasad,' Agnish _t_ oma in\nthat case ('the praise of Agni') referring both to the sacrifice generally and\nto the chanting (stoma or stotra). See next note. My MS. of Saya _n_ a's\ncommentary (from the library of the Mahara _g_ a of Bikaner) has unfortunately\nan omission here.\n\n[299:2](sbe2648.htm#fr_721) Viz. from the Sadas; 'ni _h_ sarpet,' Ka _n_ va\ntext. The verb sarp, 'to glide or creep,' is used technically of a peculiar\nnoiseless mode of leaving (ni _h_ sarp) the Sadas and returning thither\n(prasarp or pratisarp, see [paragraph 10](sbe2648.htm#4:2:4:10)), and\nrespectfully approaching the dhish _n_ ya fires. If it has to be taken here in\nthat sense, the first prohibition would seem to refer to the Hot _ri_ (cf.\nAit. Br. II, 21, where the question is argued whether or not the Hot _ri_\nought to p. 300 proceed to the chanting-place with the other priests, and is\ndecided in the negative); since the sacrificer, to whom the second prohibition\nrefers (Katy. IX, 6, 23), goes along with them, according to [IV, 2, 5,\n4](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:4). According to the commentary on Katy. IX, 6, 33, in\nperforming the sarpa _n_ a the priests and sacrificer should move along\nsitting at the morning feast; walking with bent bodies at the midday feast;\nand walking upright at the evening feast.\n\n[300:1](sbe2648.htm#fr_722) Tad u tad ya; amanasyaiva. Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[300:2](sbe2648.htm#fr_723) Or, he indeed becomes a celebrator of the Agnish\n_t_ oma.\n\n[300:3](sbe2648.htm#fr_724) The Ka _n_ va text has 'ya _s_ asvi.'\n\n[300:4](sbe2648.htm#fr_725) See [p. 99](sbe2617.htm#page_99), note\n[2](sbe2617.htm#fn_261).\n\n[300:5](sbe2648.htm#fr_726) The Ka _n_ va MS.

Cf. Katy. IX, 2, 18. Apparently he\nis to shift the sthali along the ground from the khara to the place where it\nis to stand, all grass and other objects being thus removed between this\nvessel and those standing on the mound ('vyuhyaita _m_ na t _ri_ _n_ a _m_ _k_\nanantardhaya,' Ka _n_ va text).\n\n[302:1](sbe2648.htm#fr_729) _S_ vapada, lit.

Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[303:3](sbe2648.htm#fr_732) It is more probable that the Dhruva (firm,\nconstant) derives its name from the fact that it remains intact till the very\nend of the Agnish _t_ oma, as suggested in the Petersburg Dictionary.\n\n[304:1](sbe2648.htm#fr_734) Viz. at the evening feast, when the Adhvaryu pours\nthe Soma from the Dhruva-sthali into the Hot _ri_ 's cup ([paragraph\n23](sbe2648.htm#4:2:4:23)).\n\n[304:2](sbe2648.htm#fr_735) See [p. 256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note\n[1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619).
