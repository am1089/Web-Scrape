In the beginning this was Self alone, in the shape of a person (purusha).\nHe looking round saw nothing but his Self. He first said, 'This is I;'\ntherefore he became I by name. Therefore even now, if a man is asked, he first\nsays, 'This is I,' and then pronounces the other name which he may have. And\nbecause before (purva) all this, he (the Self) burnt down (ush) all evils,\ntherefore he was a person (pur-usha). Verily he who knows this, burns down\nevery one who tries to be before him.\n\n2\\. He feared, and therefore any one who is lonely fears. He thought, 'As\nthere is nothing but myself, why should I fear?' Thence his fear passed away.\nFor what should he have feared? Verily fear arises from a second only.\n\n3\\. But he felt no delight. Therefore a man who is lonely feels no delight. He\nwished for a second. He was so large as man and wife together. He then made\nthis his Self to fall in two (pat), and thence arose husband (pati) and wife\n(patni). Therefore Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: 'We two 2 are thus (each of us)\nlike half a shell 3.' Therefore the void which was\n\np. 86\n\nthere, is filled by the wife. He embraced her, and men were born.\n\n4\\. She thought, 'How can he embrace me, after having produced me from\nhimself? I shall hide myself.'\n\nShe then became a cow, the other became a bull and embraced her, and hence\ncows were born. The one became a mare, the other a stallion; the one a male\nass, the other a female ass. He embraced her, and hence one-hoofed animals\nwere born. The one became a she-goat, the other a he-goat; the one became a\newe 1, the other a ram. He embraced her, and hence goats and sheep were born.\nAnd thus he created everything that exists in pairs, down to the ants.\n\n5\\. He knew, 'I indeed am this creation, for I created all this.' Hence he\nbecame the creation, and he who knows this lives in this his creation.\n\n6\\. Next he thus produced fire by rubbing. From the mouth, as from the fire-\nhole, and from the hands he created fire 2. Therefore both the mouth and the\nhands are inside without hair, for the fire-hole is inside without hair.\n\nAnd when they say, 'Sacrifice to this or sacrifice to that god,' each god is\nbut his manifestation, for he is all gods.\n\nNow, whatever there is moist, that he created from seed; this is Soma. So far\nverily is this universe either food or eater. Soma indeed is food, Agni eater.\nThis is the highest creation of Brahman,\n\np. 87\n\nwhen he created the gods from his better part 1, and when he, who was (then)\nmortal 2, created the immortals. Therefore it was the highest creation. And he\nwho knows this, lives in this his highest creation.\n\n7\\. Now all this was then undeveloped. It became developed by form and name,\nso that one could say, 'He, called so and so, is such a one 3.' Therefore at\npresent also all this is developed by name and form, so that one can say, 'He,\ncalled so and so, is such a one.'\n\nHe (Brahman or the Self) entered thither, to the very tips of the finger-\nnails, as a razor might be fitted in a razor-case, or as fire in a fire-place\n4.\n\nHe cannot be seen, for, in part only, when breathing, he is breath by name;\nwhen speaking, speech by name; when seeing, eye by name; when hearing, ear by\nname; when thinking, mind by name. All these are but the names of his acts.\nAnd he who worships (regards) him as the one or the other, does not know him,\nfor he is apart from this (when qualified) by the one or the other\n(predicate). Let men worship him as Self, for in the Self all these are one.\nThis Self is the footstep of everything, for through it one knows everything\n5. And as one can find again by footsteps what was lost, thus he who knows\nthis finds glory and praise.\n\np. 88\n\n8\\. This, which is nearer to us than anything, this Self, is dearer than a\nson, dearer than wealth, dearer than all else.\n\nAnd if one were to say to one who declares another than the Self dear, that he\nwill lose what is dear to him, very likely it would be so. Let him worship the\nSelf alone as dear. He who worships the Self alone as dear, the object of his\nlove will never perish 1.\n\n9\\. Here they say: 'If men think that by knowledge of Brahman they will become\neverything, what then did that Brahman know, from whence all this sprang?'\n\n10\\. Verily in the beginning this was Brahman, that Brahman knew (its) Self\nonly, saying, 'I am Brahman.' From it all this sprang. Thus, whatever Deva was\nawakened (so as to know Brahman), he indeed became that (Brahman); and the\nsame with _Ri_ shis and men. The _Ri_ shi Vamadeva saw and understood it,\nsinging, 'I was Manu (moon), I was the sun.' Therefore now also he who thus\nknows that he is Brahman, becomes all this, and even the Devas cannot prevent\nit, for he himself is their Self.\n\nNow if a man worships another deity, thinking the deity is one and he another,\nhe does not know. He is like a beast for the Devas. For verily, as many beasts\nnourish a man, thus does every man nourish the Devas. If only one beast is\ntaken away, it is not pleasant; how much more when many are taken! Therefore\nit is not pleasant to the Devas that men should know this.\n\n11\\. Verily in the beginning this was Brahman, one\n\np. 89\n\nonly. That being one, was not strong enough. It created still further the most\nexcellent Kshatra (power), viz. those Kshatras (powers) among the Devas,--\nIndra, Varu _n_ a, Soma, Rudra, Par _g_ anya, Yama, M _ri_ tyu, \xc3\x8e _s_ ana.\nTherefore there is nothing beyond the Kshatra, and therefore at the Ra _g_\nasuya sacrifice the Brahma _n_ a sits down below the Kshatriya. He confers\nthat glory on the Kshatra alone. But Brahman is (nevertheless) the birth-place\nof the Kshatra. Therefore though a king is exalted, he sits down at the end\n(of the sacrifice) below the Brahman, as his birth-place. He who injures him,\ninjures his own birth-place. He becomes worse, because he has injured one\nbetter than himself.\n\n12\\. He 1 was not strong enough. He created the Vi _s_ (people), the classes\nof Devas which in their different orders are called Vasus, Rudras, \xc3\x82dityas, Vi\n_s_ ve Devas, Maruts.\n\n13\\. He was not strong enough. He created the _S_ udra colour (caste), as\nPushan (as nourisher). This earth verily is Pushan (the nourisher); for the\nearth nourishes all this whatsoever.\n\n14\\. He was not strong enough. He created still further the most excellent Law\n(dharma). Law is the Kshatra (power) of the Kshatra 2, therefore there is\nnothing higher than the Law. Thenceforth even a weak man rules a stronger with\nthe help of the Law, as with the help of a king. Thus the Law is what is\ncalled the true. And if a man declares what is true, they say he declares the\nLaw; and if he declares the Law, they say he declares what is true. Thus both\nare the same.\n\np. 90\n\n15\\. There are then this Brahman, Kshatra, Vis, and _S_ udra. Among the Devas\nthat Brahman existed as Agni (fire) only, among men as Brahma _n_ a, as\nKshatriya through the (divine) Kshatriya, as Vaisya through the (divine)\nVaisya, as _S_ udra through the (divine) _S_ udra. Therefore people wish for\ntheir future state among the Devas through Agni (the sacrificial fire) only;\nand among men through the Brahma _n_ a, for in these two forms did Brahman\nexist.\n\nNow if a man departs this life without having seen his true future life (in\nthe Self), then that Self, not being known, does not receive and bless him, as\nif the Veda had not been read, or as if a good work had not been done. Nay,\neven if one who does not know that (Self), should perform here on earth some\ngreat holy work, it will Perish for him in the end. Let a man worship the Self\nonly as his true state. If a man worships the Self only as his true state, his\nwork does not Perish, for whatever he desires that he gets from that Self.\n\n16\\. Now verily this Self (of the ignorant man) is the world 1 of all\ncreatures. In so far as man sacrifices and pours out libations, he is the\nworld of the Devas; in so far as he repeats the hymns, &c., he is the world of\nthe _Ri_ shis; in so far as he offers cakes to the Fathers and tries to obtain\noffspring, he is the world of the Fathers; in so far as he gives shelter and\nfood to men, he is the world of men; in so far as he finds fodder and water\nfor the animals, he is the world of the animals; in so far as quadrupeds,\nbirds, and even ants live in his houses, he is their world. And as every one\nwishes his own world not to be injured,\n\np. 91\n\nthus all beings wish that he who knows this should not be injured. Verily this\nis known and has been well reasoned.\n\n17\\. In the beginning this was Self alone, one only. He desired, 'Let there be\na wife for me that I may have offspring, and let there be wealth for me that I\nmay offer sacrifices.' Verily this is the whole desire, and, even if wishing\nfor more, he would not find it. Therefore now also a lonely person desires,\n'Let there be a wife for me that I may have offspring, and let there be wealth\nfor me that I may offer sacrifices.' And so long as he does not obtain either\nof these things, he thinks he is incomplete. Now his completeness (is made up\nas follows): mind is his self (husband); speech the wife; breath the child;\nthe eye all worldly wealth, for he finds it with the eye; the ear his divine\nwealth, for he hears it with the ear. The body (atman) is his work, for with\nthe body he works. This is the fivefold 1 sacrifice, for fivefold is the\nanimal, fivefold man, fivefold all this whatsoever. He who knows this, obtains\nall this.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[85:1](sbe15055.htm#fr_281) Called Purushavidhabrahma _n_ a (Madhyandina- _s_\nakha, p. 1050).
