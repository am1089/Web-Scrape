Now I see that it no longer is--a mighty wonder!\n\nWhat is there for me to reject? what to choose? what else exists? Where is\nthere difference in the mighty ocean of the Eternal, full of the nectar of\npartless bliss?\n\nI see not, nor hear, nor know aught of this world; for I bear the mark of the\nSelf, whose form is being and bliss.\n\nHonor, honor to thee, my Guide, mighty-souled; to thee, who art free from\nsensuous bondage, who art most excellent, whose own nature is the essence of\nbliss of the secondless Everlasting, whose words are ever a mighty, shoreless\nocean of pity.\n\nAs one who was wearied with the heat, bathing himself and refreshed, in the\nenveloping light of the rayed moon, thus I have in a moment gained the\npartless excellent bliss, the imperishable word, the Self.\n\nRich am I, I have done what was to be done, freed am I from the grasp of the\nsorrowing world. My own being is everlasting bliss, I am filled full, through\nthe favor of the Self.\n\n\n\nUnbound am I, formless am I, without distinction am I, no longer able to be\nbroken; in perfect peace am I, and endless; I am stainless, immemorial.\n\np. 77\n\nI am neither the doer nor enjoyer; mine are neither change nor act. I am in\nnature pure awakening. I am the lonely One, august for ever. [490]\n\nI am apart from the personal self that sees, hears, speaks, acts, and enjoys;\neverlasting, innermost, without act; the limitless, unbound, perfect Self\nawakened.\n\nI am neither this nor that; I am even he who illumines both, the supreme, the\npure; for me is neither inner nor outer, for I am the perfect, secondless\nEternal.\n\nThe unequalled, beginningless reality is far from the thought of I and thou,\nof this and that; I am the one essence of everlasting bliss, the real, the\nsecondless Eternal.\n\nI am the Creator, I am he who makes an end of hell, he who makes an end of all\nthings old; I am the Spirit, I am the Lord; I am partless awakening, the\nendless witness; for me there is no longer any Lord, no longer I nor mine.\n\nFor I, verily, consist in all beings, enveloping them within and without,\nthrough the Self that knows; I myself am at once the enjoyer and all that is\nto be enjoyed--whatever was seen before as separate--through identity with it.\n\nIn me, the ocean of partless Bliss, world-waves rise manifold, and fall again,\nthrough the storm-winds of glamor's magic.\n\nIn me, the material and other worlds are built up by glamor, through swift\nvibrations; just as in Time which has neither part nor division, are built up\nthe world-periods, the years, the seasons, months, and days.\n\np. 78\n\nNor does the Self, on which the worlds are built, become stained by them, even\nthrough the deluded who are stained by many sins; just as even a mighty flood\nof mirage waters wets not the salt desert earth.\n\n\n\nLike the ether, I spread throughout the world; like the sun, I am marked by my\nshining; like the hills, I am everlasting and unmoved; I am like an ocean\nwithout shores.\n\nI am not bound by the body, as the clear sky is not bound by clouds; whence\nthen should the characters of waking, dreaming, dreamlessness, belong to me?\n[500]\n\nThe veil comes, and, verily, departs again; it alone performs works and enjoys\nthem. It alone wastes away and dies, while I stand like a mighty mountain,\nforever unmoved.\n\nNeither forth-going nor return belong to me, whose form is ever one, without\ndivision. He who is the one Self, without fissure or separation, perfect like\nthe ether how can he strive or act?\n\nHow should righteousness or sin belong to me, who possess not the powers of\nsense, who am above emotion, above form and change, who experience ever\npartless bliss; for the scripture teaches that in the Self is neither\nrighteousness nor sin.\n\nWhat is touched by his shadow, whether heat or cold, or foul or fair, touches\nnot at all the man, who is other than his shadow.\n\nThe natures of things beheld touch not the beholder, who is apart from them,\nsitting above unchanged, as the character of the house affects not the lamp.\n\np. 79\n\nLike the sun which witnesses the act, like the tongued flame that leads the\nconflagration, like the rope that holds what is raised; thus am I, standing on\nthe summit, the conscious Self.\n\nI am neither the actor, nor the causer of acts; I am neither he who enjoys,\nnor he who brings enjoyment; I am neither the seer, nor he who gives sight; I\nam the unequalled Self, self-luminous.\n\nWhen the disguise moves, just as the foolish-minded attribute to the sun the\ndancing of its reflection on the water, so one thinks: I am the doer, the\nenjoyer; I, also, am slain.\n\nLet this inert body move on the waters or on dry land; I am not thereby\nstained by their natures, as the ether is not stained by the nature of a jar.\n\nActing, enjoying, baseness or madness, inertness or bondage or unloosing are\nthe changes of the mind, and belong not really to the Self, the supreme\nEternal, the pure, the secondless. [510]\n\nLet Nature suffer changes ten times, a hundred, a thousand times; what have I\nto do with these commotions? For the lowering clouds touch not the sky.\n\nFrom the unmanifest, down to grossest things, all this world encountered is a\nmere reflection only. Like the ether, subtle, without beginning or end, is the\nsecondless Eternal; and what that is, I am.\n\nAll-embracing, illumining all things; under all forms all-present, yet outside\nall; everlasting, pure, unmoved, unchanging, is the secondless Eternal; and\nwhat that is, I am.\n\nWhere the differences made by glamor have sunk to\n\np. 80\n\nfinal setting, of hidden nature, perceived in secret, the Real, Wisdom, Bliss,\nand formed of bliss, is the secondless Eternal; and what that is, I am.\n\nWithout act am I, without change, without division, without form; without\nwavering am I, everlasting am I, resting on naught else, and secondless.\n\nI am altogether the Self, I am the All; I transcend all; there is none but me.\nI am pure, partless awakening; I too am unbroken bliss.\n\nThis sovereignty, self -rule, and mighty power, through the goodness of thy\npity, power, and might, has been gained by me, my guide, great-souled; honor,\nhonor to thee, and yet again honor.\n\nIn that great dream that glamor makes, in that forest of birth and age and\ndeath, I wander wearying; daily stricken by the heat, and haunted by the tiger\nof selfishness; thou hast saved me, my guide, by waking me out of sleep.
