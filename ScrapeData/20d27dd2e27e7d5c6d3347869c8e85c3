It is\nan old, and thoroughly Hindu, Legend composed in Sanskrit, and is the germ\nwhich culminated in the Arabian Nights, and which inspired the "Golden Ass" of\nApuleius, Boccacio\'s "Decamerone," the "Pentamerone," and all that class of\nfacetious fictitious literature.\n\nThe story turns chiefly on a great king named Vikram, the King Arthur of the\nEast, who in pursuance of his promise to a Jogi or Magician, brings to him the\nBaital (Vampire), who is hanging on a tree. The difficulties King Vikram and\nhis son have in bringing the Vampire into the presence of the Jogi are truly\nlaughable; and on this thread is strung a series of Hindu fairy stories, which\ncontain much interesting information on Indian customs and manners. It also\nalludes to that state, which induces Hindu devotees to allow themselves to be\nburied alive, and to appear dead for weeks or months, and then to return to\nlife again; a curious state of mesmeric catalepsy, into which they work\nthemselves by concentrating the mind and abstaining from food--a specimen of\nwhich I have given a practical illustration in the Life of Sir Richard Burton.\n\nThe following translation is rendered peculiarly; valuable and interesting by\nSir Richard Burton\'s intimate knowledge of the language. To all who understand\nthe ways of the East, it is as witty, and as full of what is popularly called\n"chaff" as it is possible to be. There is not a dull page in it, and it will\nespecially please those who delight in the weird and supernatural, the\ngrotesque, and the wild life.\n\nMy husband only gives eleven of the best tales, as it was thought the\ntranslation would prove more interesting in its abbreviated form.\n\nISABEL BURTON.  \nAugust 18th, 1893.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Preface to the First (1870) Edition.](vav03.htm)\n\n'
