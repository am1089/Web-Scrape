The garden hedge was all aflower.\n\nThe fair maid came out and said, "I will hire you with a smile."\n\nHer smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the dark.\n\nThe sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly.\n\nA child sat playing with shells.\n\nHe raised his head and seemed to know me, and said, "I hire you with nothing."\n\nFrom thenceforward that bargain struck in child\'s play made me a free man.\n\nTHE END\n\n'
