'These true desires, however, are hidden by what is false; though the\ndesires be true, they have a covering which is false. Thus, whoever belonging\nto us has departed this life, him we cannot gain back, so that we should see\nhim with our eyes.\n\n2\\. 'Those who belong to us, whether living or departed, and whatever else\nthere is which we wish for and do not obtain, all that we find there (if we\ndescend into our heart, where Brahman dwells, in the ether of the heart),\nThere are all our true desires, but hidden by what is false 1. As people who\ndo not know the country, walk again and again over a gold treasure that has\nbeen hidden somewhere in the earth and do not discover it, thus do all these\ncreatures day after day go into the Brahma-world (they are merged in Brahman,\nwhile asleep), and yet do not discover it, because they are carried away by\nuntruth (they do not come to themselves, i. e. they do not discover the true\nSelf in Brahman, dwelling in the heart).\n\n3\\. 'That Self abides in the heart. And this is the etymological explanation.\nThe heart is called h _ri_ d-ayam, instead of h _ri_ dy-ayam, i. e. He who is\nin the heart. He who knows this, that He is in the heart, goes day by day\n(when in sushupti, deep sleep) into heaven (svarga), i.e. into the: Brahman of\nthe heart.\n\n4\\. 'Now that serene being 2 which, after having\n\np. 130\n\nrisen from out this earthly body, and having reached the highest light (self-\nknowledge), appears in its true form, that is the Self,' thus he spoke (when\nasked by his pupils). This is the immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman. And\nof that Brahman the name is the True, Satyam,\n\n5\\. This name Sattyam consists of three syllables, sat-ti-yam 1. Sat signifies\nthe immortal, t, the mortal, and with yam he binds both. Because he binds\nboth, the immortal and the mortal, therefore it is yam. He who knows this goes\nday by day into heaven (svarga).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[129:1](sbe01163.htm#fr_332) All the desires mentioned before are fulfilled,\nif we find their fulfilment in our Self, in the city of Brahman within our\nheart. There we always can possess those whom we have loved, only we must not\nwish to see them with our eyes; that would be a false covering to a true\ndesire.\n\n[129:2](sbe01163.htm#fr_333) Cf. _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 3.\n\n[130:1](sbe01163.htm#fr_334) We ought probably to read Sattyam, and then Sat-\nti-yam. The i in ti would then be the dual of an anubandha \xc4\xad. Instead of\nyaddhi, I conjecture yatti. See Ait. \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka II, 5, 5.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 4](sbe01164.htm)\n\n"
