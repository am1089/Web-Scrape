It is designated as having five functions like mind.\n\nThe chief vital air has its specific effect for that reason also that in\nscripture it is designated as having five functions, pra _n_ a, apana, vyana,\nudana, samana. This distinction of functions is based on a distinction of\neffects. Pra _n_ a is the forward-function whose work is aspiration, &c.;\napana is the backward-function whose work is inspiration, &c.; vyana is that\nwhich, abiding in the junction of the two,\n\np. 90\n\nis the cause of works of strength 1; udana is the ascending function and is\nthe cause of the passing out (of the soul); samana is the function which\nconveys the juices of the food equally through all the limbs of the body. Thus\nthe pra _n_ a has five functions just as the mind (manas) has. The five\nfunctions of the mind are the five well-known ones caused by the ear, &c., and\nhaving sound and so on for their objects. By the functions of the mind we\ncannot here understand those enumerated (in B _ri_. Up. I, 5, 3), 'desire,\nrepresentation,' &c., because those are more than five. But on the former\nexplanation also there exists yet another function of the mind which does not\ndepend on the ear, &c., but has for its object the past, the future, and so\non; so that on that explanation also the number five is exceeded.--Well, let\nus then follow the principle that the opinions of other (systems) if\nunobjectionable may be adopted, and let us assume that the five functions of\nthe manas are those five which are known from the Yoga _s_ astra, viz. right\nknowledge, error, imagination, slumber, and remembrance. Or else let us assume\nthat the Sutra quotes the manas as an analogous instance merely with reference\nto the plurality (not the fivefoldness) of its functions.--In any case the\nSutra must be construed to mean that the pra _n_ a's subordinate position with\nregard to the soul follows from its having five functions like the manas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[90:1](sbe38066.htm#fr_59) Viz. the holding in of the breath; cp. _Kh_.
