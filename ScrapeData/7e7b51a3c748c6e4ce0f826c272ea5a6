Ved\xc4\x81nta, The Vedas\' End.--The Sanskrit word _Ved \xc4\x81nta_ _(veda-anta)_\nsignifies "end" or "bound of the Vedas." It was originally given, at a\nsomewhat advanced stage of their development, to the works called\n_Upanishads,_ and subsequently to the various philosophies claiming to be\nbased upon them. Besides the Upanishads, one of these philosophies will be\nnoticed in the following pages, namely the system promulgated in the ninth\ncentury by \xc5\x9aankara in his great commentary _( \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81r\xc4\xabraka-bh\xc4\x81shya)_ upon the\nepitome of Upanishadic doctrine commonly known as the _Brahma-s \xc5\xabtra,_ or\n"Aphorisms of Brahma," and traditionally ascribed to one or the other of the\nlegendary sages B\xc4\x81dar\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a and Vy\xc4\x81sa.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Four Vedas](brk05.htm)\n\n'
