Thereupon 1 he (the Sacrificer 2) offers the Vasor dhara. That\nwhole Agni has now been completed, and he is here the Vasu (good one): to that\nVasu the gods offered this shower (dhara), whence it is called 'Vasor dhara\n3;' and in like manner this (Sacrificer) offers to him this shower, and\ngratifies him thereby.\n\n9:3:2:22\\. And, again, as to why he offers the 'Vasor dhara;'--this is his\n(Agni's) Abhisheka 4; for the\n\np. 214\n\ngods, having now completed him wholly and entirely, showered upon him those\nwishes (or, objects of desire), this 'Vasor dhara;' and in like manner does\nthis (Sacrificer), now that he has completed him wholly and entirely, shower\nupon him those wishes, this 'Vasor dhara.' With ghee taken in five ladlings,\nand an offering-ladle of udumbara wood (he offers): the significance of this\nhas been explained.\n\n9:3:2:33\\. [He offers it] after offering the Vai _s_ vanara (cake)--for the\nVai _s_ vanara is the head, and food is taken in from the head. (downwards);\nand, besides, it is from the head (downwards) that he who is anointed is\nanointed;--and after offering the Maruta (cakes), for the Marutas are the\nvital airs, and through (the channels of) the vital airs food is eaten; and,\nbesides, it is at (the openings of) the vital airs that he who is anointed is\nanointed 1.\n\n9:3:2:44\\. And, furthermore, (it is offered) upon the Ara _n_ ye\xe0\xa4\xbdnu _k_ ya 2;\nfor the Ara _n_ ye\xe0\xa4\xbdnu _k_ ya is speech, and it is through (the channel of)\nspeech that food is eaten; and, besides, it is with speech that he who\n\np. 215\n\nis anointed is anointed. And everything here is wealth (vasu), for all these\n(cake-offerings) are (connected with special) wishes 1; and in order that this\nshower, be it of milk or of ghee, (may be) fraught with wealth, this oblation\nof ghee is thus offered for the beginning; and inasmuch as this shower is\nfraught with wealth, it is called 'shower of wealth.'\n\n9:3:2:55\\. He (as it were) says, 'This is mine, and that is mine;'--that is,\n'Herewith I gratify thee, and therewith;--herewith I anoint thee, and\ntherewith;' or, 'Give me this, and that!' And as soon as that shower reaches\nthe fire, that prayer is fulfilled.\n\n9:3:2:66\\. Now the gods, having gratified him (Agni) by this food, or by these\nobjects of desire 2, and having anointed him by this shower of wealth,\nsolicited from him these objects of desire 3; and having received offering,\nand being gratified and anointed, he granted them these objects of desire; and\nin like manner this (Sacrificer), having gratified him by this food, and by\nthese offerings of desire, and anointed him with this shower of wealth, now\nsolicits from him these objects of desire; and having received offering, and\nbeing gratified and anointed, he (Agni) grants him these objects of desire. In\norder to avoid discontinuance, he each time embraces two wishes,--even as one\nwould connect those living away from one another,--thinking, 'In this way\nshall they prosper by sacrifice!'\n\n9:3:2:77\\. The gods now spake, 'Through whom shall we receive these objects of\ndesire? By our own\n\np. 216\n\nself,' they said; for the sacrifice is the self of the gods, and so is the\nsacrifice that of the Sacrificer; and when he says, 'By the sacrifice they\nshall prosper!' he means to say, 'By my own self they shall prosper!'\n\n9:3:2:88\\. In twelve (things) he causes them to prosper 1, the year consists\nof twelve months, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him, and by so much food he\nthus consecrates him. In fourteen he causes them to prosper; in eight he\ncauses them to prosper; in ten he causes them to prosper; in thirteen he\ncauses them to prosper.\n\n9:3:2:99\\. He then offers the Ardhendra (libations) 2;the ardhendras are\neverything here 3: he thus gratifies him (Agni) with everything, and with\neverything he thus consecrates him.\n\n9:3:2:1010\\. He then offers (the libations relating to) the Grahas\n4;[](errata.htm#3)\\--the grahas (cups of soma, offered to\n\np. 217\n\nthe deities), doubtless, are sacrifice: by sacrifice, by food, he thus\ngratifies him; and by sacrifice he thus consecrates him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[213:1](sbe4336.htm#fr_359) That is, after offering all the seven Maruta\ncakes, the formulas of the last six of which (Va _g_. S. XVII, 81-85; XXXIX,\n7) are not given in the Brahma _n_ a. At the end the Adhvaryu mutters the\nverse XVII, 86, and thereupon he either makes the Sacrificer mutter (or\nmutters himself) verses 87-99 in praise of Agni. Katy. _S_ r. XVIII, 4, 25;\n26.\n\n[213:2](sbe4336.htm#fr_360) Thus, according to Katy. XVIII, 5, 1 (the\nAdhvaryu, according to Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 283).\n\n[213:3](sbe4336.htm#fr_361) It would rather seem to mean 'stream, or shower,\nof wealth;' cf. [paragraph 4](sbe4336.htm#9:3:2:4).\n\n[213:4](sbe4336.htm#fr_362) That is, the consecration ceremony, in which the\nking is sprinkled' with sacred water, or, so to speak, anointed. The 'Vasor\ndhara,' or 'shower of wealth,' consisting of an uninterrupted series of 401\nlibations to Agni (through which all the powers of the god are to be secured\nto the Sacrificer), is intended as the p. 214 equivalent of that ceremony for\nthe consecration of Agni as king; and, indeed, as a kind of superior\nconsecration ceremony for the (royal) Sacrificer himself, more potent than the\nRa _g_ asuya and Va _g_ apeya. There is thus to be noticed here the same\ntendency as elsewhere of exalting the efficacy of the Agni _k_ ayana, and of\nmaking it take the place of the whole of the ordinary sacrificial ceremonial.\n\n[214:1](sbe4336.htm#fr_363) When anointed, or consecrated, the king is first\nsprinkled from the front and then from behind, and finally rubbed all over,\nwith the consecrated water; see V, 4, 2, 1 seq.\n\n[214:2](sbe4336.htm#fr_364) That is, as soon as the Adhvaryu has put the Ara\n_n_ ye\xe0\xa4\xbdnu _k_ ya cake in the fire the Sacrificer begins to pour the ghee on it\nwith a large offering-ladle of udumbara wood, and the Adhvaryu begins to\nmutter the formulas.\n\n[215:1](sbe4336.htm#fr_365) Or, all these (objects) for which offerings are\nmade are objects of desire.\n\n[215:2](sbe4336.htm#fr_366) Or, perhaps, 'for (prompted by) these objects of\ndesire.'\n\n[215:3](sbe4336.htm#fr_367) Or, asked him these wishes (boons).\n\n[216:1](sbe4336.htm#fr_368) That is, he makes the objects of desire mentioned\nin the formulas used during the Vasor dhara, accrue to himself, or turn out\nwell for himself. The formulas usually contain the names of twelve such\nobjects (in six pairs), those in XVIII, 1 being--'(may) strength and gain,\nendeavour and attempt, thought and wisdom, sound and praise, fame and hearing,\nlight and heaven, prosper for (or accrue to) me by sacrifice!' In XVIII, 4,\nhowever, fourteen objects are enumerated, in XVIII, 15 (and 27) eight, in\nXVIII, 23 (and 26). ten, in XVIII, 28 thirteen.\n\n[216:2](sbe4336.htm#fr_369) Literally, 'the half-Indra ones,' the technical\nterm for the formulas of three sets of libations (XVIII, 16-18), in which\nthree sets of twelve deities are named, each pair of whom consists of Indra\ncoupled with some other deity, thus 'May Agni and Indra, Soma and Indra, &c.,\nprosper for (or accrue to) me by sacrifice!'\n\n[216:3](sbe4336.htm#fr_370) Viz. inasmuch as Indra represents the ruling\npower, and everything submits to him (III, 9, 4, 15); or inasmuch as Indra and\nAgni are the whole universe (IV, 2, 2, 14).\n\n[216:4](sbe4336.htm#fr_371) These are three sets of libations (still forming\npart of the continuous p. 217 'Vasor dhara,' or 'wealth-stream'), the formulas\nof which (XVIII, 19-21) enumerate each six pairs of cups of Soma (graha) and\nof sacrificial implements.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 3, 3.
