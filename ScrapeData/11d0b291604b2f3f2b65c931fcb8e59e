Vyasa said :-- Hearing these vicious words, Janaki became very much\nconfounded with fear and began to tremble; somehow collecting herself she\nbegan to say :-- \xc2\x93O descendant of the family of Pulastya! Why are you,\nprompted by lust, uttering these sinful words? I am born of the family of\nJanaka; therefore I cannot act wantonly according to my own inclination.\n\n\n\n3\\. O ten faced one! Better you go to Lanka quickly; else Ramchandra will take\naway your life; you will no doubt incur death for my sake.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n4-5. Thus saying, Sita Devi went towards the Sacred fire called Garhapatya,\nplaced in the house, with words \xc2\x93go away\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93go away\xc2\x94 in her mouth. He, whose\nwickedness has caused all the Lokas cry out \xc2\x93save\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93save\xc2\x94, the same Rava _n_\na, of perverted intellect, then assumed his real form, went towards the hut\nand caught hold of Sita Devi who was crying, bewildered with fear.\n\n\n\n6\\. Sita cried \xc2\x93Rama\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Rama\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Lak _s_ ma _n_ a\xc2\x94, and the sinful Rava _n_ a\ncaught hold of her and quickly mounting her on the chariot, fast got away.\n\n\n\n7-9. On the way Jatayu, the son of Aru _n_ a, met Rava _n_ a; and a terrible\nfight then ensued between the two, when the evil minded Rava _n_ a, the king\nof the Demons, killed Jatayu. Rava _n_ a carried Sita to Lanka. Then Sita\ncried like a forlorn deer and Rava _n_ a kept her in the As\xc2\x92oka forest\n(Jaffna),\n\nsurrounded and guarded by the Rak _s_ asis. The king of Lanka tempted Sita\nwith comforting words, and the kingdoms, etc., but she never swerved from her\nown pure and stainless chastity.\n\n\n\np. 241\n\n\n\n10-12. On the other side, Ramachandra after killing the deer and taking it was\ncoming back calmly, when he saw Lak _s_ ma _n_ a going to him and said \xc2\x93O Lak\n_s_ ma _n_ a! What a great blunder you have committed! Hearing the voice of\nthat villain conjurer, how is it that you have left my dear Sita alone and\ncome here!\xc2\x94 Lak _s_ ma _n_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Being pierced sharply by Sita\nDevi\xc2\x92s words (coming like sharpened arrows) and being driven away by her,\nunder the guidance of the Inevitable Destiny as it were, I have come here;\nthere is no doubt in this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n13\\. They, then, both hurriedly went to their hut, made of leaves; and there\nnot finding Sita, they were very much afflicted with sorrows and went in quest\nof Janaki.\n\n\n\n14\\. Rama and Lak _s_ ma _n_ a in their search for Sita, came at last to the\nspot where Jatayu, the king of birds, was lying on the surface of the earth,\nwith his life ultimately on the point of parting away from his body.\n\n\n\n15-16. Jatayu said :-- Rava _n_ a, the king of Lanka, carried away today\nstealthily Sita Devi; I resisted that villain who then fought with me on that\naccount and threw me down on this spot by weapons. Thus saying, the king of\nbirds died; whereupon Ramchandra performed the burning of his dead body as\nwell his funeral ceremonies. Then both of them went out of that place.\n\n\n\n17\\. Then the Lord Ramachandra killed Kabandha and freed him from his curse;\nand, through his advice, he made friendship with Sugriva, the king of the\nmonkeys, and was thus bound under a tie.\n\n\n\n18\\. Next Rama killed the hero Bali as a duty and gave the excellent kingdom\nof Ki _s_ kindhya to his new friend Sugriva according to his promise.\n\n\n\n19\\. Then, he began to ceaselessly think of the stealing away of Sita by Rava\n_n_ a and passed away the four months of the rainy season there with his\nbrother Lak _s_ ma _n_ a.\n\n\n\n20\\. Rama, being very much shaken on account of the bereavement of Sita, began\nto address Lak _s_ ma _n_ a thus :-- \xc2\x93O Saumitre! The desires of the daughter\nof the king of Kekaya are now fulfilled.\n\n\n\n21\\. Janaki will no more be obtained; without Janaki I will not go back to\nAyodhya; without Janaki I won\xc2\x92t be able to live any longer.\n\n\n\n22\\. Kingdom lost, dwelling in forests happened, father left his body, at last\nthe dear wife is lost; the cruel hands of Destiny are tormenting me now thus;\nwhat more it will inflict, how can I say now?\n\n\n\n23\\. O Brother Lak _s_ ma _n_ a! What is to happen is very hard to be known\nbeforehand by men; I cannot say, what is written on my fate after this,\npainful or otherwise.\n\n\n\np. 242\n\n\n\n24\\. See! Both of us, the descendants of Manu, though born in a royal family,\nare exiled in forests due to our past deeds.\n\n\n\n25\\. O Lak _s_ ma _n_ a! It is by Fate, too, that you, abandoning the\npleasures of the royal surroundings, have come out with me; and you, too, are\nnow suffering heaps of dire troubles with me.\n\n\n\n26\\. No one in our family suffered so much as we are suffering; why we talk of\nour family! No human being was ever born or will ever take his birth that\nsuffered or will suffer like me so many troubles, will be like me\nincapacitated and a penniless pauper.\n\n\n\n27\\. O Saumitre! I am drowned in the ocean of pains and troubles; What am I to\ndo now? I have no means to cross this ocean; I am quite helpless, no doubt.\n\n\n\n28\\. No money, nor armies, O hero! you are my one and only one companion; O\nbrother! On whom shall I be angry when I am suffering on account of my own\ndeeds?\n\n\n\n29\\. Alas! The kingdom that could have been compared in prosperity to the\nIndra Sabha, was almost obtained by me when, in an instant, I lost it and am\nnow in exile in forest. Lak _s_ ma _n_! Who can ascertain what is in the womb\nof Destiny?\n\n\n\n30\\. Oh! That soft bodied Sita, with her child like nature came out with us in\nthis forest; but the inexorable Fate has now drowned her, that perfectly\nbeautiful woman, into an ocean of sorrows, difficult to be crossed?\n\n\n\n31\\. That fair daughter of Janaka is extremely devoted to me; she is pure and\nholy. How will she be able to suffer troubles in the house of the king of\nLanka!\n\n\n\n32\\. O Lak _s_ ma _n_ a! Sita Devi will never come under the control of Rava\n_n_ a; how can that excellent chaste woman act like an ordinary public woman?\n\n\n\n33\\. O Lak _s_ ma _n_ a! Rest assured that in case Rava _n_ a exercises, out\nof his lordly position, any violence on Sita, she will rather put an end to\nher life than come under his control.\n\n\n\n34\\. O Lak _s_ ma _n_ a! And when Janaki sacrifices her life, I will assuredly\ndo the same; for, of what use, then is this body to me when that fair Sita has\ngone away with her life?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n35\\. While the lotus eyed Ramchandra was thus weeping and expressing his\nregrets and sorrows, the religious Lak _s_ ma _n_ a consoled him with the\nfollowing sweet, truthful, words :--\n\n\n\np. 243\n\n\n\n36\\. \xc2\x93O Hero of the heroes! Kindly cast aside this weakness and have patience;\nI will soon kill that villain demon Rava _n_ a and get you back your Sita\nDevi.\n\n\n\n37\\. The wise steady persons remain on account of their fortitude, unshaken in\ntheir hearts whether in joy or in sorrow; whereas men, of little intellect,\nindulge in sorrows when they are happy.\n\n\n\n38\\. Coming in union and going out in disunion, both are under the hands of\nDestiny; What, then, there is the need for expressing sorrows for this body,\nwhich is not soul.\n\n\n\n39\\. As we have been banished from our kingdom into this forest, as there has\nhappened this bereavement of Sita, so, in proper time, we will again get back\nSita Devi.\n\n\n\n40\\. O Darling of Janaki! There must come a time when sorrows will be\nconverted into happiness and vice versa; there will be nothing otherwise. So\navoid this sorrow now and have firmness.\n\n\n\n41\\. There are multitudes of monkeys, who are our helping hands; they will go\nto all the four quarters and bring back to us the news of the daughter of\nJanaka; there is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n42\\. O Lord! Knowing the way to Lanka, we will go there and kill by our\nprowess the villainous Rava _n_ a and bring back Sita Devi.\n\n\n\n43\\. Or we will call Bharata with Satrugh _n_ a and with all the armies we all\nunited will kill our enemy; why, then, are you thus expressing sorrows in\nvain.\n\n\n\n44\\. O Lord! our ancestor Raghu, the hero of heroes, the monarch; won his\nvictories over the ten quarters; and you belong to that family and are now\nplunged in grief!\n\n\n\n45\\. Alone, I can defeat all the Devas and the Demons; and if I get help, is\nthere any doubt, then, in my killing, that Rava _n_ a, the disgrace of the\nfamily of Rak _s_ asas.\n\n\n\n46\\. O Powerful One! We may call to, our aid the king of Janaka and root out\nthat wicked source of enemy to the Devas.\n\n\n\n47-48. O Descendant of Raghu! Like the rim of a wheel, happiness and pain come\nalternately; it is not that happiness, or pain comes and remains for ever. He\nwhose mind is very much overwhelmed. with pain or happiness, is the man who is\nalways plunged in an ocean of misery; and he can never expect to become happy.\n\n\n\n49\\. See! In days of yore, Indra once got addicted into vicious habits. The\nDevas united put in place of Indra, the king Nahu _s_ a.\n\n\n\np. 244\n\n\n\n50\\. Then Indra, terrified, relinquished his post and passed very many years\ninto an unknown and unnoticed state within the lotus.\n\n\n\n51\\. Again, when time changed, he got his own post back; and the king Nahu _s_\na fell down on this earth and became transformed into a boa constrictor (a big\nserpent), through the curse of a Ri _s_ i.\n\n\n\n52\\. The king Nahu _s_ a wanted the wife of Indra and insulted a Brahmi _n_ ;\ntherefore, he was, under the curse of Mahar _s_ i Agasti, transformed into a\nsnake on the earth.\n\n\n\n53\\. Therefore, O Raghava! One ought not to plunge in grief, when a danger\ncomes; rather one should be quite energetic in times of danger and remain\nfirm; thus, the sages do.\n\n\n\n54\\. O Lord of the world! You are high minded, omniscient and omnipotent; why\nare you now overwhelmed with grief, like an ordinary mortal.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n55\\. Vyasa said :-- Oh king! Thus consoled by Lak _s_ ma _n_ a, Rama discarded\nall his heavy sorrows and began to remain with his heart firm and at rest.\n\n\n\nThus ends the 29th chapter on the stealing of Sita and the sorrows of Rama in\nthe 3rd Skandha of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 30](bk03ch30.htm)\n\n'
