(The circumstance of the soul being represented as the object of sight)\nindicates the fulfilment of the promissory statement; so \xc3\x82 _s_ marathya\nthinks.\n\nThe fact that the text proclaims as the object of sight that Self which is\ndenoted as something, dear indicates the fulfilment of the promise made in the\npassages, 'When the Self is known all this is known,' 'All this is that Self.'\nFor if the individual soul were different from the highest Self, the knowledge\nof the latter would not imply the knowledge of the former, and thus the\npromise that through the knowledge of one thing everything is to be known\nwould not be fulfilled. Hence the initial\n\np. 277\n\nstatement aims at representing the individual Self and the highest Self as\nnon-different for the purpose of fulfilling the promise made.--This is the\nopinion of the teacher \xc3\x82 _s_ marathya 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[277:1](sbe34131.htm#fr_247) The comment of the Bhamati on the Sutra runs as\nfollows: As the sparks issuing from a fire are not absolutely different from\nthe fire, because they participate in the nature of the fire; and, on the\nother hand, are not absolutely non-different from the fire, because in that\ncase they could be distinguished neither from the fire nor from each other; so\nthe individual souls also--which are effects of Brahman--are neither\nabsolutely different from Brahman, for that would mean that they are not of\nthe nature of intelligence; nor absolutely non-different from Brahman, because\nin that case they could not be distinguished from each other, and because, if\nthey were identical with Brahman and therefore omniscient, it would be useless\nto give them any instruction. Hence the individual souls are somehow different\nfrom Brahman and somehow non-different.--The technical name of the doctrine\nhere represented by \xc3\x82 _s_ marathya is bhedabhedavada.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 21](sbe34132.htm)\n\n"
