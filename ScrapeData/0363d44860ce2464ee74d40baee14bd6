(The relations of the dead person) now carry (his sacred) fires and (his)\nsacrificial vessels in that direction.\n\np. 238\n\n2\\. After them aged persons forming an odd number, men and women not going\ntogether, (carry) the dead body.\n\n3\\. Some (say) that (the dead body should be carried) in a cart with a seat,\ndrawn by cows.\n\n4 4. (Some prescribe) a she-animal for covering (the dead body with its\nlimbs):\n\n5\\. A cow,\n\n6\\. Or a she-goat of one colour.\n\n7\\. Some (take) a black one.\n\n8\\. They tie (a rope) to its left fore-foot and lead it behind (the dead\nbody).\n\n9\\. Then follow the relations (of the dead person), wearing their sacrificial\ncords below (round their body), with the hair-locks untied, the older fines\nfirst, the younger ones last.\n\n10 10. When they have thus arrived at the place, the performer (of the rites)\nwalks three times round the spot with his left side turned towards it, and\nwith a _S_ ami branch sprinkles water on it, with (the verse), 'Go away,\nwithdraw, and depart from here' (Rig-veda X, 14, 9).\n\n11\\. To the south-east, on an elevated corner (of that place), he places the\n\xc3\x82havaniya fire,\n\n12 12-13. To the north-west the Garhapatya fire,\n\n13\\. To the south-west the Dakshi _n_ a fire.\n\n14 14. After that a person that knows (how to do it), piles up between the\nfires a pile of fuel.\n\np. 239\n\n15\\. After sacrificial grass and a black antelope's skin with the hair outside\nhas been spread out there, they place the dead body thereon, which they have\ncarried so as to pass by the Garhapatya fire on its north-side, turning its\nhead towards the \xc3\x82havaniya.\n\n16 16. To the north (of the body they place) the wife (of the deceased),\n\n17\\. And a bow for a Kshatriya.\n\n18 18. Her brother-in-law, being a representative of her husband, or a pupil\n(of her husband), or an aged servant, should cause her to rise (from that\nplace) with (the verse), 'Arise, O wife, to the world of life' (Rig-veda X,\n18, 8).\n\n19 19. The performer (of the rites) should murmur (that verse), if a _S_ udra\n(makes her rise from the pile).\n\n20\\. With (the verse), 'Taking the bow out of the hand of the deceased' (Rig-\nveda X, 18, 9), (he takes away) the bow.\n\n21\\. It has been stated (what is to be done) in case a _S_ udra (should\nperform this act).\n\n22 22. Having bent the bow, he should, before the piling up (of the things\nmentioned below, which are put on the dead body) is done, break it to pieces,\nand throw it (on the pile).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[237:12](sbe29146.htm#fr_574) Naraya _n_ a: By the word _s_ ma _s_ ana\n(cemetery) two different _s_ ma _s_ anas are designated here, because below\n(Sutra 15) a distinction is added (to the word _s_ ma _s_ ana), in the words,\n'This is a characteristic required for the _s_ ma _s_ ana where the body is to\nbe burned.' Thus the place where the body is burned, and the place where the\ngathered bones are deposited, both are called _s_ ma _s_ ana.\n\n[237:1](sbe29147.htm#fr_580) 2, 1. In the direction stated above, chap. 1, 6.\n\n[238:4](sbe29147.htm#fr_581) See chap. 3, 20-25.\n\n[238:10](sbe29147.htm#fr_582) Kartodakena (i.e. karta udakena) is evidently\nthe right reading, not gartodakena.\n\n[238:12-13](sbe29147.htm#fr_583) 12, 13. The words, 'on an elevated corner'\n(Sutra 11) have to be supplied.\n\n[238:14](sbe29147.htm#fr_584) As to the pronoun enam, which refers, with an\nirregular p. 239 construction, to the dead person, comp _S_ atapatha Brahma\n_n_ a XII, 5, 2, 7.\n\n[239:16](sbe29147.htm#fr_585) The wife is made to lie down on the pile.\n\n[239:18](sbe29147.htm#fr_586) Possibly the words devara _h_ and patisthaniya\n_h_ refer to two different persons, so that we should have to translate, 'Her\nbrother-in-law, (or some other) representative of her husband, &c.'\n\n[239:19](sbe29147.htm#fr_587) This refers to the case of the aged servant. The\nword for which we have put _S_ udra here and in Sutra 21, is v _ri_ shala.\n\n[239:22](sbe29147.htm#fr_588) See Sutra 19.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3](sbe29148.htm)\n\n"
