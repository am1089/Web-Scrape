[The Hot _ri_ continues], 'May Agni, the priest (hot _ri_ ), know\n(undertake) Agni's priestly duty (hautram),'--thereby he says 'may Agni, as\nHot _ri_ , know this!' 'Agni's priestly duty' he says, because it is his duty\nthat he must know;--'that means of salvation 1,'--the means of salvation,\nassuredly, is the sacrifice: 'may he know the sacrifice' is what he thereby\nsays.--'Favourable to thee, O Sacrificer, is\n\np. 139\n\nthe deity!' by this he says 'favourable is the deity to thee, O Sacrificer,\nwhose Hot _ri_ is Agni 1!'--'Take up 2 the spoon, O Adhvaryu, full of butter!'\nthereby he urges on the Adhvaryu. The reason why he mentions one (spoon) only\n(is this).\n\n1:5:2:22\\. The Sacrificer, doubtless, stands behind the _g_ uhu, and he, who\nmeans evil to him, stands behind the upabh _ri_ t; and if he were to speak of\ntwo (spoons), he would cause the spiteful enemy to countervail the Sacrificer.\nBehind the _g_ uhu stands the eater, and behind the upabh _ri_ t the one to be\neaten; and if he were to speak of two (spoons), he would make the one to be\neaten countervail the eater. For these reasons he speaks of one (spoon) only.\n\n1:5:2:33\\. [He continues],'--(the spoon which is) devoted to the gods,\npossessed of all boons,' he praises, he magnifies it when he says 'devoted to\nthe gods, possessed of all boons.'--'Let us praise the gods, the praiseworthy!\nlet us adore the adorable! let us worship the worshipful!' that is, 'let us\npraise those gods who are praiseworthy! let us adore those who are adorable!\nlet us worship those who are worthy of worship!' the praiseworthy, to wit, are\nthe men, the adorable the fathers, and the worshipful the gods.\n\n1:5:2:44\\. For, indeed, the creatures that are not allowed to take part in the\nsacrifice are forlorn; and therefore\n\np. 140\n\nhe makes those creatures here on earth that are not forlorn, take part in the\nsacrifice: behind the men are the beasts, and behind the gods are the birds,\nthe plants, and the trees; and thus all that here exists is made to take part\nin the sacrifice.\n\n1:5:2:55\\. These same (preceding formulas) are nine utterances; for nine, in\nnumber, are those breaths (or vital airs) in man 1, and these he thereby puts\ninto him (the sacrificer): for this reason there are nine utterances.\n\n1:5:2:66\\. The sacrifice fled away from the gods. The gods called out after\nit, 'Listen (a- _s_ ru) to us 2! come back to us!' It replied, 'So be it!' and\nreturned to the gods; and with what had thus returned to them, the gods\nworshipped; and by worshipping with it they became the gods they now are.\n\n1:5:2:77\\. Now when he (the Adhvaryu) calls (on the \xc3\x82gnidhra), he thereby\ncalls after the sacrifice, 'Listen to us! come back to us!' and when he (the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra) responds, then the sacrifice comes back, saying 'so be it!' and with\nit, thus passing over to them, as with seed 3, the priests carry on the\ntradition, imperceptibly to the sacrificer; for even as people hand on from\none to the other a full vessel 4, in\n\np. 141\n\nthe same way they (the priests) hand down that (sacrifice) from one to the\nother. They hand it down by means of speech, for the sacrifice is speech\n(prayer), and speech is seed: therefore they keep up the tradition by means of\nit.\n\n1:5:2:88\\. After he has said (to the Hot _ri_ ), 'Recite!' the Adhvaryu must\nutter nothing improper (worldly); neither must the Hot _ri_ utter anything\nimproper. The Adhvaryu 1 utters his call: thereby the sacrifice passes on to\nthe \xc3\x82gnidhra.\n\n1:5:2:99\\. The \xc3\x82gnidhra must utter nothing improper until his response. The\n\xc3\x82gnidhra responds: thereby the sacrifice passes back to the Adhvaryu.\n\n1:5:2:1010\\. The Adhvaryu must utter nothing improper until he pronounces (the\nword) 'ya _g_ a (recite the offering-prayer):' in saying 'ya _g_ a' the\nAdhvaryu hands the sacrifice on to the Hot _ri_.\n\n1:5:2:1111\\. The Hot _ri_ must utter nothing improper until his vasha _t_\n-call. By the vasha _t_ -call he pours it (the sacrifice) into the fire, as\nseed into the womb; for the fire is indeed the womb of the sacrifice, from\nthence it is brought forth. So now at the havis-sacrifice. And at the Soma-\ncult,--\n\n1:5:2:1212\\. When he has drawn (the Soma), the Adhvaryu must not utter\nanything improper until his summons\n\np. 142\n\n[paragraph continues] (for the chanting of the stotra 1): with the call 'draw\nnear!' the Adhvaryu hands the sacrifice on to the Udgat _ri_ s (chanters).\n\n1:5:2:1313\\. The Udgat _ri_ s must not utter anything improper until the last\n(stotra-verse): 'this is the last one,' thus thinking, the Udgat _ri_ s hand\non the sacrifice to the Hot _ri_.\n\n1:5:2:1414\\. The Hot _ri_ must utter nothing improper until the vasha _t_\n-call. With the vasha _t_ -call he pours it (the sacrifice) into the fire, as\nseed into the womb; for the fire is indeed the womb of the sacrifice, since\nfrom thence it is brought forth.\n\n1:5:2:1515\\. If he whom the sacrifice approaches were to utter anything\nimproper, he would waste the sacrifice, even as he might waste (water by\nspilling from) a full vessel. And where the officiating priests thus practice\nsacrifice with a perfect mutual understanding between them, there everything\nworks regularly and no hitch occurs: therefore it is in this way that the\nsacrifice must be nursed.\n\n1:5:2:1616\\. Now there are here five utterances, viz. (1) 'Bid (him, Agni, or\nthem) hear!' (2) 'Yea, may he (or, one) hear!' (3) 'Pronounce the prayer to\nthe kindling-sticks!' (4) 'We who pronounce the prayer . . .' (5) 'May he bear\n(the sacrifice to the gods) 2!' fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the animal\nvictim, five are the seasons of the year: this is the one measure of the\nsacrifice, this its consummation.\n\np. 143\n\n1:5:2:1717\\. These (five formulas) consist of seventeen\nsyllables;--seventeenfold, indeed, is Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is the\nsacrifice: this is the one measure of the sacrifice, this its consummation.\n\n1:5:2:1818\\. With 'O _s_ ravaya 1!' the gods sent forth the east wind; with\n'Astu _s_ rausha _t_  1!' they caused the clouds to flow together; with 'Ya\n_g_ a (pronounce the ya _g_ ya)!' (they sent forth) the lightning; with' Ye ya\n_g_ amahe (we who pray),' the thunder; with the vasha _t_ -call they caused it\nto rain 2.\n\n1:5:2:1919\\. Should he (the sacrificer) be desirous of rain, or should he\nperform a special offering 3, or even at the new- and full-moon sacrifice\nitself, he may say, 'Verily, I am desirous of rain!'--and he may also say to\nthe Adhvaryu, 'Ponder thou in thy mind the east wind and the lightning!'--to\nthe \xc3\x82gnidhra, 'Ponder thou the clouds in thy mind!'--to the Hot _ri_ , 'Ponder\nthou in thy mind the thunder and rain!'--to the Brahman, 'Ponder thou all,\nthese in thy mind!'--for where the officiating priests thus practice sacrifice\nwith a perfect mutual understanding between them, there it will indeed rain.\n\n1:5:2:2020\\. With 'O _s_ ravaya!' the gods called the shining one (vira _g_ ,\nviz. cow), with 'Astu _s_ rausha _t_!' they untied the calf and let it go to\nher; with 'Ya _g_ a!' they raised (its head to the udder of the cow) 4; with\n\np. 144\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Ye ya _g_ amahe!' they sat down by her (for milking);\nwith the vasha _t_ -call they milked her. The shining one, doubtless, is this\n(earth), and of her this is the milking: and for him who knows this to be the\nmilking of the shining one, this shining (earth-cow) thus milks out all his\ndesires.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[138:1](sbe1223.htm#fr_343) Pravitram, literally 'that which promotes,\nprotects' ('unser Hort'). Saya _n_ a on Taitt. S. II, 5, 9, 5 explains it by'\nprak _ri_ sh _t_ am avitram phaladanarupam asmadraksha _n_ am yasmin homanush\n_th_ ane tad idam pravitram.' For this and the succeeding formulas, see \xc3\x82 _s_\nv. I, 4, 10-11.\n\n[139:1](sbe1223.htm#fr_344) \xc3\x82 _s_ v. I, 4, 10, and Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kh. I, 6 give as\nbelonging to the text of the mantra: yo agni _m_ hotaram av _ri_ tha _h_ ,\n'thou who hast chosen Agni for thy Hot _ri_ ;' the same reading is mentioned\nin Taitt. S. II, 5, 9, 5.\n\n[139:2](sbe1223.htm#fr_345) Thus Saya _n_ a (asyasva = haste dharaya);\n'schopfe ein (ladle in),' St. Petersburg Dictionary; 'pour into the fire,'\nHillebrandt, p. 93.\n\n[140:1](sbe1223.htm#fr_346) See p. 20, note 1.\n\n[140:2](sbe1223.htm#fr_347) The legend is intended to explain the origin and\nsymbolical meaning of the call (a _s_ rava _n_ a) of the Adhvaryu (viz. O _s_\nravaya! make listen!') and the response (pratya _s_ rava _n_ a) of the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra (viz. astu _s_ rausha _t_!).\n\n[140:3](sbe1223.htm#fr_348) The sacrifice is the seed (vi _g_ a) that produces\nheaven as its fruit. Saya _n_ a.\n\n[140:4](sbe1223.htm#fr_349) I.e. 'even as they pass on from hand to hand a\npail (gha _t_ a) filled with water when a tub is to be filled inside the\nhouse.' Saya _n_ a.\n\n[141:1](sbe1223.htm#fr_350) As soon as the Hot _ri_ has pronounced the formula\n'O Adhvaryu, take up the spoon full of butter!' (par. 2 above), the Adhvaryu\ntakes the two offering-spoons ( _g_ uhu and upabh _ri_ t) and steps back (from\nthe west side along the north side of the altar and the west side of the fire)\nto the south side of the altar and the fire (the ya _g_ ati-sthana), and (with\nhis face to north-east) utters his call, and (having been responded to by the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra) calls on the Hot _ri_ : 'samidho ya _g_ a (pronounce the offering-\nprayer to the kindling-sticks)!' Katy. III, 2, 16.\n\n[142:1](sbe1223.htm#fr_351) See IV, 2, 5, 7-8.\n\n[142:2](sbe1223.htm#fr_352) (1) O _s_ ravaya (for a sravaya), the Adhvaryu's\ncall; (2) astu _s_ rausha _t_ , the \xc3\x82gnidhra's response; (3) (samidho) ya _g_\na, the Adhvaryu's summons to the Hot _ri_ ; (4) ye ya _g_ amahe, the beginning\nof the Hot _ri_ 's ya _g_ ya, or offering-prayer (see [p.\n135](sbe1222.htm#page_135) note); (5) vausha _t_ , concluding formula of the\nya _g_ ya.\n\n[143:1](sbe1223.htm#fr_354) For a _s_ ravaya (cf. [p.\n131](sbe1221.htm#page_131), note [2](sbe1222.htm#fn_329)), i.e. 'bid (him,\nAgni, or them) hear!' but the author here makes _s_ ravaya the causative of\n_s_ ru (sru), 'to flow;' hence a _s_ ravaya, 'make flow;' and astu _s_ rausha\n_t_ [properly 'Yea, may he (or one) hear!'] he makes 'Yea, may it flow!'\n\n[143:2](sbe1223.htm#fr_355) A fanciful etymology of vasha _t_ from root v _ri_\nsh, 'to rain;' for the true derivation of the word, see [p.\n88](sbe1214.htm#page_88), note [2](sbe1214.htm#fn_254).\n\n[143:3](sbe1223.htm#fr_356) I.e. an offering made with a view to the\nobtainment of some special wish (kamyesh _t_ i).\n\n[143:4](sbe1223.htm#fr_357) Thus (or 'they led it up to the udder of the cow')\nSaya _n_ a p. 144 explains udanayan. In his commentary on Taitt. S. I, 6, 11\nhe interprets the analogous udanaishit by 'he raises (or brings) the milk-\npail;' where the St. Petersburg Dictionary apparently takes it in the sense of\n'he led the calf away from the cow.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 5, 3.
