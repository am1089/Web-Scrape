 \nWhat course should I, to duty true,  \nMy sire, from youth to age pursue?\n\nFATHER\n\nBegin thy course with study; store  \nThe mind with holy Vedic lore.  \nThat stage completed,--seek a wife,  \nAnd gain the fruit of wedded life,  \nA race of sons, by rites to seal,  \nWhen thou art gone, thy spirit\'s weal.  \nThen light the sacred fires, and bring  \nThe gods a fitting offering.  \nWhen age draws nigh, the world forsake,  \nThy chosen home the forest make;  \nAnd there a calm, ascetic sage,  \nA war against thy passions wage,  \nThat, cleansed from every earthly stain, p. 29  \nThou may\'st supreme perfection gain.\n\nSON\n\nAnd art thou then, my father, wise,  \nWhen thou dost such a life advise?  \nWhat wise or thoughtful man delights  \nIn formal studies, empty rites?  \nShould such pursuits and thoughts engage  \nA mortal more than half his age?  \nThe world is ever vexed, distressed;  \nThe noiseless robbers never rest.\n\nFATHER\n\nTell how the world is vexed, distressed;  \nWhat noiseless robbers never rest?  \nWhat means thy dark, alarming speech?  \nIn plainer words thy meaning teach.\n\nSON\n\nThe world is vexed by death; decay  \nThe frames of mortals wears away.  \nDost thou not note the circling flight  \nOf those still robbers, day and night,  \nWith stealthy tread which hurrying past,  \nSteal all our lives away at last?  \nWhen well I know how death infests  \nThis world of woe, and never rests, p. 30  \nHow can I still, in thoughtless mood,  \nConfide in future earthly good?  \nSince life with every night that goes,  \nStill shorter, and yet shorter grows,  \nMust not the wise perceive how vain  \nAre all their days that yet remain?  \nWe, whom life\'s narrow bounds confine,  \nLike fish in shallow water, pine.  \n    While men on other thoughts are bent,--  \nLike those on gathering flowers intent,--  \nAs lambs by wolves are snatched away,--  \nThey fall to death a sudden prey,  \nBefore they yet the good have gained  \nFor which they every nerve had strained.  \n    No moment lose; in serious mood  \nBegin at once to practice good;  \nTo-morrow\'s task to-day conclude;  \nThe evening\'s work complete at noon:--  \nNo duty can be done too soon.  \nWho knows whom death may seize to-night,  \nAnd who shall see the morning light?  \nAnd death will never stop to ask,  \nIf thou hast done, or not, thy task.  \nWhile yet a youth, from folly cease;  \nThrough virtue seek for calm and peace.  \nSo shalt thou here attain renown, p. 31  \nAnd future bliss thy lot shall crown.  \n    Death interrupts the futile dreams  \nOf men who, plunged in various schemes,  \nAre thinking: "This or that is done;  \nThis still to do; that just begun."  \nAs torrents undermine the ranks  \nOf stately trees that crown their banks,  \nAnd sweep them downwards to the main,  \nDeath tears from earth those dreamers vain.  \n    While some are all on traffic bent,  \nAnd some on household cares intent,  \nAre fighting hard with pressing need,  \nAnd struggling wives and babes to feed,  \nOr with some other ills of life  \nAre waging an incessant strife;  \n    Death these hard toiling men uproots,  \nBefore they yet have reaped the fruits  \nOf all their labour, all their thought,  \nOf all the battles they have fought.  \n    Death spares no class, no rank, nor age;  \nHe carries off the fool, the sage,  \nThe knave, the saint, the young, the old,  \nThe weak, the strong, the faint, the bold.  \n    As soon as men are born, decay  \nAnd death begin to haunt their way.  \nHow can\'st thou, thoughtless, careless, rest, p. 32  \nWhen endless woes thy life infest;  \n    When pains and pangs thy strength consume--  \nThy frame to dissolution doom?  \n    Forsake the busy haunts of men,  \nFor there has death his favourite den.  \nIn lonely forests seek thy home,  \nFor there the gods delight to roam.  \n    Fast bound by old attachment\'s spell,  \nMen love amid their kin to dwell.  \nThis bond the sage asunder tears;  \nThe fool to rend it never cares.  \n    Thou dost advise that I should please  \nWith sacrifice the deities.  \nSuch rites I disregard as vain;  \nThrough these can none perfection gain.  \nWhy sate the gods, at cruel feasts,  \nWith flesh and blood of slaughtered beasts?  \nFar other sacrifices I  \nWill offer unremittingly;  \nThe sacrifice of calm, of truth,  \nThe sacrifice of peace, of ruth,  \nOf life serenely, purely, spent,  \nOf thought profound on Brahma bent.  \nWho offers these, may death defy,  \nAnd hope for immortality.  \n    And then should say\'st that I should wed, p. 33  \nAnd sons should gain to tend me, dead,  \nBy offering pious gifts, to seal,  \nWhen I am gone, my spirit\'s weal.  \nBut I shall ask no pious zeal  \nOf sons to guard my future weal.  \nNo child of mine shall ever boast  \nHis rites have saved his father\'s ghost.  \nOf my own bliss I\'ll pay the price,  \nAnd be myself my sacrifice.  \n               From Mahabharata xii. 6526 ff.
