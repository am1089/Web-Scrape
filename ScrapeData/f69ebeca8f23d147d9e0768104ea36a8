On account of the impossibility of a secondary (origin of the pra _n_ as).\n\nAgainst the objection that the origin of the pra _n_ as must be understood in\na secondary sense because the text states that they existed before the origin\nof the world, the Sutrakara declares 'on account of the impossibility of a\nsecondary origin.' The statement as to the origin of the pra _n_ as cannot be\ntaken in a secondary sense because therefrom would result the abandonment of a\ngeneral assertion. For after the text has asserted that the knowledge of\neverything depends on the knowledge of one ('What is that through which when\nit is known everything else becomes known?' Mu. Up. I, 1, 3), it goes on to\nsay, in order to prove that assertion, that 'From him is born pra _n_ a,' &c.\n(Mu. Up. II, 1, 3). Now the assertion is made good only if the whole world\nincluding the pra _n_ as is an effect of Brahman, because then there is no\neffect independent of the material cause; if on the other hand the statement\nas to the origin of the pra _n_ as were taken in a secondary sense, the\nassertion would thereby be stultified. The text, moreover, makes some\nconcluding statements about the matter asserted, 'The Person is all this,\nsacrifice, penance, Brahman, the highest Immortal' (II, 1, 10), and 'Brahman\nalone is all this; it is the Best.'--That same\n\np. 77\n\nassertion is to be connected with such passages as the following, 'When we\nsee, hear, perceive, and know the Self, then all this is known' (B _ri_. Up.\nII, 4, 5).--How then have we to account for the statement that the pra _n_ as\nexisted before the creation?--That statement, we reply, does not refer to the\nfundamental causal substance; for we ascertain from scriptural passages, such\nas Mu. Up. II, 1, 2 ('That heavenly Person is without breath and without mind,\npure, higher than the high Imperishable'), that the fundamental causal\nsubstance is devoid of all distinctions such as breath and the like. We must\nrather view the statement about the existence of the pra _n_ as before the\ncreation as having for its object a subordinate causal substance 1, and being\nmade with reference to the effects of the latter only. For it is known from\n_S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti that even in the universe of evolved things many\nstates of being may stand to each other in the relation of causal substance\nand effect.--In the adhikara _n_ a treating of the ether there occurred a\nSutra (composed of the same syllables) 'gau _n_ yasambhavat,' which as being\nthe purvapaksha-sutra had to be explained as 'gau _n_ i asambhavat,' 'the\nstatement about the origin of ether must be taken in a secondary sense on\naccount of the impossibility (of the primary sense).' There the final\nconclusion was established by means of the abandonment of the general\nassertion. Here on the other hand the Sutra is the Siddhanta Sutra and we have\ntherefore explained it as meaning 'on account of the impossibility of a\nsecondary meaning.'--Those who explain the present Sutra in the same way as\nthe previous Sutra overlook the fact of the general assertion being abandoned\n(viz. if the passages referring to the origin of the pra _n_ as were taken in\na secondary sense).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[77:1](sbe38056.htm#fr_52) Such as Hira _n_ yagarbha.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 3](sbe38057.htm)\n\n"
