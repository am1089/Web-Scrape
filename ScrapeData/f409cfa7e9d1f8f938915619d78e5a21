When he snatched away the child from\nher, she said, joining her hands, "O brother! this infant girl is thy niece,\ndo not kill her, as she is my last child. You have put to death my sons, the\nloss of whom afflicts me greatly; why will you increase your crimes by killing\nthis infant without cause?"\n\nKuns replied, "I will not give the child alive to thee; that is; I will not\nlet her live, because whoever marries her, will put me to death." Having said\nthis, and gone outside, just as he was about to dash the child to pieces, she\nescaped from his hand, and ascended to heaven, and exclaimed, "O Kuns! what\nhave you gained by attempting to dash me to pieces, thy enemy has been born\nsomewhere, and now thou shalt not escape with life?"\n\nHaving heard this, Kuns filled with regret, came to where Basoodeo and Dewukee\nwere standing, and on his arrival, had their handcuffs and leg irons cut off;\nand submissively said, "I have committed a great crime in putting your sons to\ndeath; how will this stain be washed out, in what birth shall I\n\np. 26\n\nobtain salvation? Your gods were false, who said, that in Dewukee\'s eighth\npregnancy a boy should be born; this has not been the case, but a girl has\nbeen produced, and she too having escaped from my hands has ascended to\nheaven; exercise compassion, and do not allow your thoughts to dwell upon my\nsins; because no one can obliterate what has been written in fate. After\nhaving come into the world, a man cannot be free from life, death, good and\nbad fortune. They, who are wise, consider life and death alike, and the proud\nlook upon them as friendly and hostile. You are great observers of truth in\nhaving brought your sons to me."\n\nHaving thus spoken, when Kuns began repeatedly to entreat them, Basoodeo Jee\nsaid, "O great king! you say truly, that the fault is not your\'s in this case,\nas God had written what has happened in our fate." Hearing this, Kuns, being\nhighly delighted, brought Basoodeo and Dewukee in the most friendly manner to\nhis house; and having entertained them, and presented them with robes, brought\nthem back again with the greatest respect: and having sent for a counsellor,\nhe said, "Dewee has stated, that my enemy has been born; for which reason, put\nthe gods to death wherever you find them; because they have spoken falsely to\nme, in stating, that my foe should be born in the eighth pregnancy of\nDewukee."--The counsellor said, "O great king! what great difficulty will\nthere be in destroying them: they are beggars from birth; and whenever you\nshow anger, they will run away. What power have they of opposing you? Bruhmu\nis engaged during the eight puhurs in reflection, and contemplation: Muhadeo\neats bhang, and the thorn apple: Indru has no power over you--There remains\nNarayun, who does not understand war; he remains enjoying himself with\nLuchmee." Kuns said, "Explain, how can we find Narayun, and conquer him?"--The\ncounsellor replied, "If you wish to conquer Narayun, destroy all those in\nwhose houses he dwells during\n\np. 27\n\nthe eight puhurs: Brahmins, worshippers of Vishnu, Jogees, devotees with\nmatted hair, religious asceticks, Sunyasees, wandering religionists, and all\nthe worshippers of Huri:--seize them all, from children to old men, so that\nnot one may be left alive." On hearing this, Kuns said to the counsellor, "Do\nyou go, and destroy them all." Having obtained this order, the counsellor,\ntaking with him all sorts of devils, departed, and having gone into the city\nbegan to search for cows, Brahmins, children, and the worshippers of Huri, and\nadopting treachery and violence, to put them to death.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VI](psa07.htm)\n\n'
