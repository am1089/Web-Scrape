On account of the difference of words.\n\nThat which possesses the attributes of consisting of mind, and so on, cannot\nbe the individual soul, for that reason also that there is a difference of\nwords.\n\nThat is to say, we meet with another scriptural passage of kindred subject-\nmatter ( _S_ at. Bra. X, 6, 3, 2), 'Like a rice grain, or a barley grain, or a\ncanary seed or the kernel of a canary seed, thus that golden person is in the\nSelf.' There one word, i.e. the locative 'in the Self,' denotes the embodied\nSelf, and a different word, viz. the nominative 'person,' denotes the Self\ndistinguished by the qualities of consisting of mind, &c. We therefrom\nconclude that the two are different.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 6](sbe34043.htm)\n\n"
