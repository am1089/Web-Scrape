Charm to stop the flow of blood.\n\n1\\. The maidens that go yonder, the veins, clothed in red garments, like\nsisters without a brother, bereft of strength, they shall stand still!  \n2\\. Stand still, thou lower one, stand still, thou higher one; do thou in the\nmiddle also stand still! The most tiny (vein) stands still: may then the great\nartery also stand still!  \nOf the hundred arteries, and the thousand veins, those in the middle here have\nindeed stood still. At the same time the ends have ceased (to flow).  \n4\\. Around you has passed a great sandy dike: stand ye still, pray take your\ncase!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 31. Charm against worms](av035.htm)\n\n'
