Manu II, 205.\n\n[26:13](sbe0210.htm#fr_222) \'Another (commentator) says, "He, the pupil, must\nembrace their feet (at every meeting) from that time (when he first saw his\nteacher do it)." Because the word "but" is used in the Sutra, he must do so\neven after he has returned home (on completion of his studies).\'--Haradatta.\n\n[27:14](sbe0210.htm#fr_223) \'More than one teacher,\' i.e. several, who have\ntaught him the several Vedas. Each Brahman generally knowing one Veda only.\n\nThis passage shows, that the young Brahmans in olden time, just as now, went\nfrom one teacher to the other, learning from each what he knew. The rules,\nwhich seemingly enjoin a pupil to stay with one and the same teacher, refer\nonly to the principle, that the pupil must stay with his teacher, until he has\nlearnt the subject which he began with him.\n\n[27:18](sbe0210.htm#fr_224) \'Religious, ceremonies, i.e. the wedding and the\nlike.

Here also\nHaradatta states that the permission to. leave the teacher is to be restricted\nto those who have not solemnly bound themselves to their teacher by allowing\nhim to perform the ceremony of initiation.\n\n[28:27](sbe0210.htm#fr_229) Manu II, 208-212.\n\n[28:28](sbe0210.htm#fr_230) \'The use of the present "adhyapayati," shows that\nthis rule holds good only for the time during which he is taught by such a\nman.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[28:29](sbe0210.htm#fr_231) \'Because (an older fellow-student) is of use to\nhim, according to the verse: One-fourth (of his learning) a pupil receives\nfrom his teacher, one-fourth he acquires by his own intelligence, one-fourth\nfrom his fellow students, one-fourth he is taught by time.\'-- Haradatta.\n\n[28:30](sbe0210.htm#fr_232) Manu II, 2, 207-209.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 2, Kha _n_ _d_ a 8](sbe0211.htm)\n\n'
