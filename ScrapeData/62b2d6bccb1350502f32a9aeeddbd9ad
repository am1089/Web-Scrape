Sugriva hied  \nWithin the mountain\'s caverned side.  \nImpelled by love that stirred each thought  \nThe precious tokens quickly brought,  \n\nAnd said to Raghu\'s son, Behold  \nThis garment and these rings of gold,  \nIn Rama\'s hand with friendly haste  \nThe jewels and the robe he placed.  \nThen, like the moon by mist assailed,  \nThe tear-dimmed eyes of Rama failed;  \nThat burst of woe unmanned his frame,  \nWoe sprung from passion for his dame.  \nAnd with his manly strength o\'erthrown,  \nHe fell and cried, Ah me! mine own!  \nAgain, again close to his breast  \nThe ornaments and robe he pressed.  \nWhile the quick pants that shook his frame  \nAs from a furious serpent came.  \nOn his dear brother standing nigh  \nHe turned at length his piteous eye;  \nAnd, while his tears increasing ran,  \nIn bitter wail he thus began:  \n\'Look, brother, and behold once more  \nThe ornaments and robe she wore,  \nDropped while the giant bore away  \nIn cruel arras his struggling prey,  \nDropped in some quiet spot, I ween,  \nWhere the young grass was soft and green;  \nFor still untouched by spot or stain  \nTheir former beauty all retain.\'  \n   He spoke with many a tear and sigh,  \nAnd thus his brother made reply:  \n\'The bracelets thou hast fondly shown,  \nAnd earrings, are to me unknown,  \nBut by long service taught I greet  \nThe anklets of her honoured feet.\' 1b  \n   Then to Sugriva Rama, best  \nOf Raghu\'s sons, these words addressed:  \n   \'Say to what quarter of the sky  \nThe cruel fiend was seen to fly.  \nBearing afar my captured wife,  \nMy darling dearer tban my life.  \nSpeak, Vanar King, that I may know  \nWhere dwells the cause of all my woe;  \nThe fiend for whose transgression all  \nThe giants by this hand shall fall.  \nHe who the Maithil lady stole  \nAnd kindled fury in my soul,  \nHas sought his fate in senseless pride  \nAnd opened Death\'s dark portal wide.  \nThen toll me, Vanar lord, I pray,  \n   The dwelling of my foe.  \nAnd he, beneath this hand, to-day  \n   To Yama\'s halls shall go.\'  \n\np. 331  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[329:1b](ry279.htm#fr_557) Bali the king _de facto_.\n\n[329:2b](ry279.htm#fr_558) With the Indian, as with the ancient Greeks, the\nthrobbing of the right eye in a man is an auspicious sign, the throbbing of\nthe left eye is the opposite.

It seems that allusion is here made to the Vedas submerged in the\ndepth of the sea, but promptly recovered by Vishn\'u in one of his incarnation,\nas the brahmanic legend relates, with which the ordhodoxy of the Brahmans\nintended perhaps to allude to the prompt restoration and uninterrupted\ncontinuity of the ancient vedic tradition."\n\nGORRESIO.\n\n[330:2](ry280.htm#fr_560) Like the wife of a Naga or Serpent- God carried off\nby an eagle.
