Now the following vows are (to be kept by an ascetic):\n\n2\\. Abstention from injuring living beings, truthfulness, abstention from\nappropriating the property of others, continence, (and) liberality. 2\n\n3\\. There are five minor vows, (viz.) abstention from anger, obedience towards\nthe Guru, avoidance of rashness, cleanliness and purity in eating. 3\n\n4\\. Now (follows the rule for) begging. Let him 4\n\np. 280\n\nask Brahma _n_ as, both those who have houses ( _s_ alina) and those who lead\na wandering life (yayavara), for alms, when the Vai _s_ vadeva offering has\nbeen finished.\n\n5\\. Let him ask (for it), prefacing (his request with the word) Bhavat.\n\n6\\. Let him stand begging no longer than the time required for milking a cow.\n\n7\\. When he returns from begging, he lays (the alms) down in a pure place,\nwashes his hands and feet, and announces (what he obtained) to the sun,\n(reciting the text), 'Ud u tya _m_ _k_ itram,' &c. He (also) announces it to\nBrahman (with the text), 'The first-born Brahman,' &c. 7\n\n8\\. It is declared in the Veda, 'After the Brahmadhana the sacrificer himself\n(contains) the sacrificial fires. His respiration (pra _n_ a, represents) the\nGarhapatya fire, the air that goes downwards (apana, represents) the\nAnvaharyapa _k_ ana (or Dakshi _n_ a) fire, the circulation in the body\n(vyana, represents) the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, the cerebral circulation (udana) and\nthe abdominal circulation (samana, represent) the Sabhya and \xc3\x82vasathya fires.\nThese five fires are abiding in 'the soul. He (therefore) offers (the\noblations) in the soul alone.' 8\n\n9\\. 'This sacrifice, offered in the soul, which is located in and based on the\nsoul, leads the soul to happiness.'\n\n10\\. Giving, compassionately, portions (of his food) to the living beings, and\nsprinkling the remainder\n\np. 281\n\nwith water, he shall eat it as if it were a medicine.\n\n11\\. After he has eaten and sipped water, he mutters (the texts), 'Out of\ndarkness we,' &c., (and), My speech resides in the mouth,' &c., and worships\nthe sun with the (verse called) _G_ yotishmati. 11\n\n12\\. Let him eat food, given without asking, regarding which nothing has been\nsettled before-hand and which has reached him accidentally, so much only as is\nsufficient to sustain life. 12\n\n13\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Eight mouthfuls (make) the\nmeal of an ascetic, sixteen (that) of a hermit in the woods, thirty-two (that)\nof a householder, an unlimited (quantity that) of a student.' 13\n\n14\\. 'Alms (may) either (be obtained) from (men\n\nof) the three castes, or the food (given) by a single Brahma _n_ a (may be\neaten); or (he may obtain food) from (men of) all castes, and not (eat) that\ngiven by a single Brahma _n_ a.'\n\n15\\. Now they quote (the following special rules) for the case that the\nteachers explain (the doctrine) of the Upanishads: 'Diligently standing (in\nthe day-time), keeping silence, sitting (at night) with crossed legs, bathing\nthree times a day, and eating\n\np. 282\n\nat the fourth, sixth, or eighth (meal-time only), he shall subsist entirely on\n(rice) grains, oil-cake, food prepared from barley, sour milk, (and) milk.'\n\n16\\. It is declared in the Veda, On that (occasion) he shall rigidly keep\nsilence; pressing the teeth together he may converse, without opening his\nmouth, as much as is necessary with teachers deeply versed in the three Vedas\n(and) with ascetics possessing a great knowledge of the scriptures, not with\nwomen, nor when he would break (his vow).'\n\n17\\. (Let him keep) only one of (the rules which enjoin) standing (in the day-\ntime), rigid silence, and sitting (at night) with crossed legs; let him not\nkeep all three together.\n\n18\\. It is declared in the Veda, And he who has gone there may eat, in times\nof distress, a small quantity of the food prescribed by his vow after (having\npartaken of other dishes), provided he does not break (his vow).' 18\n\n19\\. 'Eight (things) do not cause him who is intent on standing (in the day-\ntime), keeping rigid silence, sitting (at night) with crossed legs, bathing\nthree times a day, and (eating) at the fourth, sixth, or eighth meal-time\nonly, to break his vow, (viz.) water, roots, clarified butter, milk,\nsacrificial food, the wish of a Brahma _n_ a, an order of his teacher, and\nmedicine.' 19\n\n20\\. Let him mutter the (Mantras which must be\n\np. 283\n\nrecited at the) Agnihotra, in the evening and in the morning,\n\n21\\. After performing his evening devotions by (reciting the verses called)\nVaru _n_ is, and his morning devotions by (reciting the verses called)\nMaitris. 21\n\n22\\. An ascetic shall keep no fire, have no house, no home, and no protector.\nHe may enter a village in order to collect alms, and emit speech at the\nprivate recitation of the Veda.' 22\n\n23\\. It is declared in the Veda,' Limited in number are the _Ri_ k-verses,\nlimited in number are the Samans, limited is the answer (of the Adhvaryu\npriest): 23\n\n24\\. 'Thus (an ascetic) shall not give up the Veda, (but live), until he is\nliberated from the body, at the root of the tree.' 24\n\n25\\. 'The tree (is) the Veda; the syllable Om is its root; the syllable Om is\nthe essence of the Veda.'\n\n26\\. 'Meditating on the syllable Om, he becomes\n\np. 284\n\nfit (to be united with) Brahman.' Thus spake the lord of created beings.\n\n27\\. Let him cleanse the vessel of Brahman with the seven Vyah _ri_ tis. 27\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[279:2](sbe1472.htm#fr_1314) **18**. The five vows (vratas) named here are the\nprincipal ones. As to the vow of 'liberality' Govinda remarks that though the\nascetic possesses no 'store' and no property in the ordinary sense of the\nword, still he can have books and give those away.\n\n[279:3](sbe1472.htm#fr_1315) 'Avoidance of rashness,' i.e. committing any act\nwhich might destroy life.\n\n[279:4](sbe1472.htm#fr_1316) 'When the Vai _s_ vadeva offering has been\nfinished,' i.e. when people. have had their dinner; see also Vasish _th_ a X,\n7.\n\n[280:7](sbe1472.htm#fr_1317) The second text occurs repeatedly in the\nTaittiriya-veda, e _g_. Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 1, 10.\n\n[280:8](sbe1472.htm#fr_1318) Regarding the Brahmadhana, see above, II, 10, 17,\n19.\n\n[281:11](sbe1472.htm#fr_1319) The first text occurs frequently in the\nTaittiriya-veda, e.g. Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita IV, i, 7, 4; the second,\nTaittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 72. The Gyotishmati is, according to Govinda, the\nfirst of the two Mantras quoted.\n\n[281:12](sbe1472.htm#fr_1320) According to Govinda this verse gives the\nopinion of 'some' teachers, not the author's. Asa _m_ k _li_ ptam, 'regarding\nwhich nothing has been settled beforehand,' indicates, according to Govinda,\nthat the ascetic must not even mentally determine what he is going to eat.\n\n[281:13](sbe1472.htm#fr_1321) See above, II, 7, 13, 7.\n\n[282:18](sbe1472.htm#fr_1322) 'The meaning is, that in times of distress,\nhaving partaken at his pleasure (of other food), he may afterwards eat of one\n(of the substances mentioned above, viz.) rice-grains and the rest.'--Govinda.\n\n[282:19](sbe1472.htm#fr_1323) All the MSS. except M. have snana, 'bathing,'\ninstead of sthana, 'standing (in the day-time),' though the reading is clearly\nwrong.\n\n[283:21](sbe1472.htm#fr_1324) The Maitris occur Taitt. Sa _m_ hita III, 4, 11,\n5, and the Varu _n_ is follow them immediately.\n\n[283:22](sbe1472.htm#fr_1325) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9, 21, 10.\n\n[283:23](sbe1472.htm#fr_1326) This and the next Sutras are intended to teach\nthat ascetics may limit their private recitation to the repetition of the, pra\n_n_ ava, the syllable Om: According to Govinda the passage of the Veda quoted\nrefers originally to the _K_ aturhotara _h_ , which the Taittiriya Brahma _n_\na II, 2, I, 4, and III, 12, 5, I identifies with. the Brahman, and where the\npratigara, the answer of the Adhvaryu priest, is 'O _m_ hota _h_ ' (Aitareya\nBrahma _n_ a V, 25).\n\n[283:24](sbe1472.htm#fr_1327) I have taken v _ri_ kshamulikovedasa _m_ nyasi\nto stand for v _ri_ kshamuliko avedasa _m_ nyasi. For the vedasa _m_ nyasa,\n'giving up the Veda,' is not permitted to an ascetic; see e.g. Vasish _th_ a\nX, 4. But even without the negative particle vedasa _m_ nyasi may convey a\nsense not opposed to the general teaching of the Sm _ri_ tis. For it may be\ntaken to mean 'abandoning (the recitation of other portions of) the Veda.'\n\n[284:27](sbe1472.htm#fr_1328) Govinda is uncertain if the term brahmabha _g_\nana, 'the vessel of Brahman,' refers to the alms-bowl or to the body of the\nascetic. Probably both are meant, and the Sutra is intended to prescribe the\nfrequent recitation of the Vyah _ri_ tis in addition to the syllable Om.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na III, Adhyaya 1](sbe1473.htm)\n\n"
