Every day the young fellow used to go out and get what\nhe could by begging. This continued for some time, till at last he became\nquite tired of such a wretched life, and determined to go and try his luck in\nanother country. He informed his wife of his intention, and ordered her to\nmanage somehow or other for the old people during the few months that he would\nbe absent. He begged her to be industrious, lest his parents should be angry\nand curse him.\n\nOne morning he started with some food in a bundle, and walked on day after\nday, till he reached the chief city of the neighbouring country. Here he went\nand sat down by a merchant\'s shop and asked alms. The merchant inquired whence\nhe had come, why he had come, and what was his caste; to which he replied that\nhe was a Brahman, and was wandering hither and thither begging a livelihood\nfor himself and wife and parents. Moved with pity for the man, the merchant\nadvised him to visit the kind and generous king of that country, and offered\nto accompany him to the court. Now, at that time it happened that the king was\nseeking for a Brahman to look after a golden temple which he had just had\nbuilt. His Majesty was very glad, therefore, when he saw the Brahman and heard\nthat he was good and honest. He at once deputed him to the charge of this\ntemple, and ordered fifty kharwars of rice and one hundred rupees to be paid\nto him every year as wages.\n\nTwo months after this, the Brahman\'s wife, not having heard any news of her\nhusband, left the house and went in quest of him. By a happy fate she arrived\nat the very place that he had reached, where she heard that every morning at\nthe golden temple a golden rupee was given in the king\'s name to any beggar\nwho chose to go for it. Accordingly, on the following morning she went to the\nplace and met her husband.\n\n"Why have you come here?" he asked. "Why have you left my parents? Care you\nnot whether they curse me and I die? Go back immediately, and await my\nreturn."\n\n"No, no," said the woman. "I cannot go back to starve and see your old father\nand mother die. There is not a grain of rice left in the house."\n\n"O Bhagawant!" exclaimed the Brahman. "Here, take this," he continued,\nscribbling a few lines on some paper, and then handing it to her, "and give it\nto the king. You will see that he will give you a lac of rupees for it." Thus\nsaying he dismissed her, and the woman left.\n\nOn this scrap of paper were written three pieces of advice - First, If a\nperson is travelling and reaches any strange place at night, let him be\ncareful where he puts up, and not close his eyes in sleep, lest he close them\nin death. Secondly, If a man has a married sister, and visits her in great\npomp, she will receive him for the sake of what she can obtain from him; but\nif he comes to her in poverty, she will frown on him and disown him. Thirdly,\nIf a man has to do any work, he must do it himself, and do it with might and\nwithout fear.\n\nOn reaching her home the Brahmani told her parents of her meeting with her\nhusband, and what a valuable piece of paper he had given her; but not liking\nto go before the king herself, she sent one of her relations. The king read\nthe paper, and ordering the man to be flogged, dismissed him. The next morning\nthe Brahmani took the paper, and while she was going along the road to the\ndarbar reading it, the king\'s son met her, and asked what she was reading,\nwhereupon she replied that she held in her hands a paper containing certain\nbits of advice, for which she wanted a lac of rupees. The prince asked her to\nshow it to him, and when he had read it gave her a parwana for the amount, and\nrode on. The poor Brahmani was very thankful. That day she laid in a great\nstore of provisions, sufficient to last them all for a long time.\n\nIn the evening the prince related to his father the meeting with the woman,\nand the purchase of the piece of paper. He thought his father would applaud\nthe act. But it was not so. The king was more angry than before, and banished\nhis son from the country. So the prince bade adieu to his mother and relations\nand friends, and rode off on his horse, whither he did not know. At nightfall\nhe arrived at some place, where a man met him, and invited him to lodge at his\nhouse. The prince accepted the invitation, and was treated like a prince.\nMatting was spread for him to squat on, \'and the best provisions set before\nhim.\n\n"Ah!" thought he, as he lay down to rest, "here is a case for the first piece\nof advice that the Brahmani gave me. I will not sleep to-night."\n\nIt was well that he thus resolved, for in the middle of the night the man rose\nup, and taking a sword in his hand, rushed to the prince with the intention of\nkilling him. But he rose up and spoke.\n\n"Do not slay me," he said. "What profit would you get from my death? If you\nkilled me you would be sorry afterwards, like that man who killed his dog."\n\n"What man? What dog?" he asked.\n\n"I will tell you," said the prince, "if you will give me that sword."\n\nSo he gave him the sword, and the prince began his story:\n\n"Once upon a time there lived a wealthy merchant who had a pet dog. He was\nsuddenly reduced to poverty, and had to part with his dog. He got a loan of\nfive thousand rupees from a brother merchant, leaving the dog as a pledge, and\nwith the money began business again. Not long after this the other merchant\'s\nshop was broken into by thieves and completely sacked. There \'was hardly ten\nrupees\' worth left in the place. The faithful dog, however, knew what was\ngoing on, and went and followed the thieves, and saw where they deposited the\nthings, and then returned.\n\n"In the morning there was great weeping and lamentation in the merchant\'s\nhouse when it was known what had happened. The merchant himself nearly went\nmad. Meanwhile the dog kept on running to the door, and pulling at his\nmaster\'s shirt and paijamas, as though wishing him to go outside. At last a\nfriend suggested that, perhaps, the dog knew something of the whereabouts of\nthe things, and advised the merchant to follow its leadings. The merchant\nconsented, and went after the dog right up to the very place where the thieves\nhad hidden the goods. Here the animal scraped and barked, and showed in\nvarious ways that the things were underneath. So the merchant and his friends\ndug about the place, and soon came upon all the stolen property. Nothing was\nmissing. There was everything just as the thieves had taken them.\n\n"The merchant was very glad. On returning to his house, he at once sent the\ndog back to its old master with a letter rolled under the collar, wherein he\nhad written about the sagacity of the beast, and begged his friend to forget\nthe loan and to accept another five thousand rupees as a present. When this\nmerchant saw his dog coming back again, he thought, \'Alas! my friend is\nwanting the money. How can I pay him? I have not had sufficient time to\nrecover myself from my recent losses. I will slay the dog ere be reaches the\nthreshold, and say that another must have slain it. Thus there will be an end\nof my debt. No dog, no loan.\' Accordingly he ran out and killed the poor dog,\nwhen the letter fell out of its collar. The merchant picked it up and read it.\nHow great was his grief and disappointment when he knew the facts of the case!\n\n"Beware," continued the prince, \'lest you do that which afterwards you would\ngive your life not to have done."\n\nBy the time the prince had concluded this story it was nearly morning, and he\nwent away, after rewarding the man.\n\nThe prince then visited the country belonging to his brother-in-law. He\ndisguised himself as a jogi, and sitting down by a tree near the palace,\npretended to be absorbed in worship. News of the man and of his wonderful\npiety reached the ears of the king. He felt interested in him, as his wife was\nvery ill; and he had sought for hakims to cure her, but in vain. He thought\nthat, perhaps, this holy man could do something for her. So he sent to him.\nBut the jogi refused to tread the halls of a king, saying that his dwelling\nwas the open air, and that if his Majesty wished to see him he must come\nhimself and bring his wife to the place. Then the king took his wife and\nbrought her to the jogi. The holy man bade her prostrate herself before him,\nand when she had remained in this position for about three hours, he told her\nto rise and go, for she was cured.\n\nIn the evening there was great consternation in the palace, because the queen\nhad lost her pearl rosary, and nobody knew anything about it. At length some\none went to the jogi, and found it on the ground by the place where the queen\nhad prostrated herself. When the king heard this he was very angry, and\nordered the jogi to be executed. This stern order, however, was not carried\nout, as the prince bribed the men and escaped from the country. But he knew\nthat the second bit of advice was true.\n\nClad in his own clothes, the prince was walking along one day when he saw a\npotter crying and laughing alternately with his wife and children. "O fool,"\nsaid he, "what is the matter? If you laugh, why do you weep? If you weep, why\ndo you laugh?"\n\n"Do not bother me," said the potter. "What does it matter to you?"\n\n"Pardon me," said the prince, "but I should like to know the reason."\n\n"The reason is this, then," said the potter. "The king of this country has a\ndaughter whom he is obliged to marry every day, because all her husbands die\nthe first night of their stay with her. Nearly all the young men of the place\nhave thus perished, and our son will be called on soon. We laugh at the\nabsurdity of the thing--a potter\'s son marrying a princess, and we cry at the\nterrible consequence of the marriage. What can we do?"\n\n"Truly a matter for laughing and weeping. But weep no more," said the prince.\n"I will exchange places with your son, and will be married to the princess\ninstead of him. Only give me suitable garments, and prepare me for the\noccasion."\n\nSo the potter gave him beautiful raiment and ornaments, and the prince went to\nthe palace. At night he was conducted to the apartment of the princess. "Dread\nhour!" thought he; "am I to die like the scores of young men before me?" He\nclenched his sword with firm grip, and lay down on his bed, intending to keep\nawake all the night and see what would happen. In the middle of the night he\nsaw two Shahmars come out from the nostrils of the princess. They stole over\ntowards him, intending to kill him, like the others who had been before him:\nbut he was ready for them. He laid hold of his sword, and when the snakes\nreached his bed he struck at them and killed them. In the morning the king\ncame as usual to inquire, and was surprised to hear his daughter and the\nprince talking. gaily together. "Surely," said he, "this man must be her\nhusband, as he only can live with her."\n\n"Where do you come from? Who are you?" asked the king, entering the room.\n\n"O king! "replied the prince, "I am the son of a king who rules over such-and-\nsuch a country."\n\nWhen he heard this the king was very glad, and bade the prince to abide in his\npalace, and appointed him his successor to the throne. The prince remained at\nthe palace for more than a year, and then asked permission to visit his own\ncountry, which was granted. The king gave him elephants, horses, jewels, and\nabundance of money for the expenses of the way and as presents for his father,\nand the prince started.\n\nOn the way he had to pass through the country belonging to his brother-in-law,\nwhom we have already mentioned. Report of his arrival reached the ears of the\nking, who came with rope-tied hands and haltered neck to do him homage. He\nmost humbly begged him to stay at his palace, and to accept what little\nhospitality could be provided. While the prince was staying at the palace be\nsaw his sister, who greeted him with smiles and kisses. On leaving he told her\nhow she and her husband had treated him at his first visit, and how he\nescaped; and then gave them two elephants; two beautiful horses, fifteen\nsoldiers, and ten lacs rupees\' worth of jewels.\n\nAfterwards he went to his own home, and informed his mother and father of his\narrival. Alas! his parents bad both become blind from weeping about the loss\nof their son. "Let him come in," said the king, "and put his hands upon our\neyes, and we shall see again." So the prince entered, and was most\naffectionately greeted by his old parents; and he laid his hands on their\neyes, and they saw again.\n\nThen the prince told his father all that had happened to him, and how he had\nbeen saved several times by attending to the advice that he had purchased from\nthe Brahmani. Whereupon the king expressed his sorrow for having sent him\naway, and all was joy and peace again.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Gold-Giving Serpent](ift16.htm)\n\n'
