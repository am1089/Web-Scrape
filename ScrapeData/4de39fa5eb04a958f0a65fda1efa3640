The non-difference of them (i.e. of cause and effect) results from such\nterms as \'origin\' and the like.\n\nThe 1 refutation contained in the preceding Sutra was set forth on the\ncondition of the practical distinction of enjoyers and objects of enjoyment\nbeing acknowledged. In reality, however, that distinction does not exist\nbecause there is understood to be non-difference (identity) of cause and\neffect. The effect is this manifold world consisting of ether and so on; the\ncause is the highest Brahman. Of the effect it is understood that in reality\nit is non-different from the cause, i.e. has no existence apart from the\ncause.--How so?--\'On account of the scriptural word "origin" and others.\' The\nword \'origin\' is used in connexion with a simile, in a passage undertaking to\nshow how through the knowledge of one thing [everything](errata.htm#2) is\nknown; viz. _Kh._ Up. VI, 1, 4, \'As, my dear, by one clod of clay all that is\nmade of clay is known, the modification (i.e. the effect; the thing made of\nclay) being a name merely which has its origin in speech, while the truth is\nthat it is clay merely; thus,\' &c.--The meaning of this passage is that, if\nthere is known a lump of clay which really and truly is nothing but clay 2,\nthere are known thereby likewise all things made of clay, such as jars,\ndishes, pails, and so on, all of which agree in having clay for their true\nnature. For these modifications or effects are names only, exist through or\noriginate from speech only, while in reality there exists no such thing as a\nmodification. In so far as they are names (individual effects distinguished by\nnames) they are untrue; in so far\n\np. 321\n\nas they are clay they are true.--This parallel instance is given with\nreference to Brahman; applying the phrase \'having its origin in speech\' to the\ncase illustrated by the instance quoted we understand that the entire body of\neffects has no existence apart from Brahman.--Later on again the text, after\nhaving declared that fire, water, and earth are the effects of Brahman,\nmaintains that the effects of these three elements have no existence apart\nfrom them, \'Thus has vanished the specific nature of burning fire, the\nmodification being a mere name which has its origin in speech, while only the\nthree colours are what is true\' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 4, 1).--Other sacred texts\nalso whose purport it is to intimate the unity of the Self are to be quoted\nhere, in accordance with the \'and others\' of the Sutra. Such texts are, \'In\nthat all this has its Self; it is the True, it is the Self, thou art that\' (\n_Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 7); \'This everything, all is that Self\' ( _Bri_. Up. II, 4,\n6); \'Brahman alone is all this\' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); \'The Self is all this\' (\n_Kh_. Up. VII, 25, 2); \'There is in it no diversity\' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 25).--On\nany other assumption it would not be possible to maintain that by the\nknowledge of one thing everything becomes known (as the text quoted above\ndeclares). We therefore must adopt the following view. In the same way as\nthose parts of ethereal space which are limited by jars and waterpots are not\nreally different from the universal ethereal space, and as the water of a\nmirage is not really different from the surface of the salty steppe--for the\nnature of that water is that it is seen in one moment and has vanished in the\nnext, and moreover, it is not to be perceived by its own nature (i. e. apart\nfrom the surface of the desert 1)--; so this manifold world with its objects\nof enjoyment, enjoyers and so on has no existence apart from Brahman.--But--it\nmight be objected--Brahman has in itself elements of manifoldness. As the tree\nhas many branches, so Brahman possesses many powers\n\np. 322\n\nand energies dependent on those powers. Unity and manifoldness are therefore\nboth true. Thus, a tree considered in itself is one, but it is manifold if\nviewed as having branches; so the sea in itself is one, but manifold as having\nwaves and foam; so the clay in itself is one, but manifold if viewed with\nregard to the jars and dishes made of it. On this assumption the process of\nfinal release resulting from right knowledge may be established in connexion\nwith the element of unity (in Brahman), while the two processes of common\nworldly activity and of activity according to the Veda--which depend on the\nkarmaka _nd_ a--may be established in connexion with the element of\nmanifoldness. And with this view the parallel instances of clay &c. agree very\nwell.\n\nThis theory, we reply, is untenable because in the instance (quoted in the\nUpanishad) the phrase \'as clay they are true\' asserts the cause only to be\ntrue while the phrase \'having its origin in speech\' declares the unreality of\nall effects. And with reference to the matter illustrated by the instance\ngiven (viz. the highest cause, Brahman) we read, \'In that all this has its\nSelf;\' and, again, \'That is true;\' whereby it is asserted that only the one\nhighest cause is true. The following passage again, \'That is the Self; thou\nart that, O _S_ vetaketu!\' teaches that the embodied soul (the individual\nsoul) also is Brahman. (And we must note that) the passage distinctly teaches\nthat the fact of the embodied soul having its Self in Brahman is self-\nestablished, not to be accomplished by endeavour. This doctrine of the\nindividual soul having its Self in Brahman, if once accepted as the doctrine\nof the Veda, does away with the independent existence of the individual soul,\njust as the idea of the rope does away with the idea of the snake (for which\nthe rope had been mistaken). And if the doctrine of the independent existence\nof the individual soul has to be set aside, then the opinion of the entire\nphenomenal world--which is based on the individual soul--having an independent\nexistence is likewise to be set aside. But only for the establishment of the\nlatter an element of manifoldness would have to be assumed in Brahman, in\n\np. 323\n\naddition to the element of unity.--Scriptural passages also (such as, \'When\nthe Self only is all this, how should he see another?\' B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 13)\ndeclare that for him who sees that everything has its Self in Brahman the\nwhole phenomenal world with its actions, agents, and results of actions is\nnon-existent. Nor can it be said that this non-existence of the phenomenal\nworld is declared (by Scripture) to be limited to certain states; for the\npassage \'Thou art that\' shows that the general fact of Brahman being the Self\nof all is not limited by any particular state. Moreover, Scripture, showing by\nthe instance of the thief ( _Kh_. VI, 16) that the false-minded is bound while\nthe true-minded is released, declares thereby that unity is the one true\nexistence while manifoldness is evolved out of wrong knowledge. For if both\nwere true how could the man who acquiesces in the reality of this phenomenal\nworld be called false-minded 1? Another scriptural passage (\'from death to\ndeath goes he who perceives therein any diversity,\' B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 19)\ndeclares the same, by blaming those who perceive any distinction.--Moreover,\non the doctrine, which we are at present impugning, release cannot result from\nknowledge, because the doctrine does not acknowledge that some kind of wrong\nknowledge, to be removed by perfect knowledge, is the cause of the phenomenal\nworld. For how can the cognition of unity remove the cognition of manifoldness\nif both are true?\n\nOther objections are started.--If we acquiesce in the doctrine of absolute\nunity, the ordinary means of right knowledge, perception, &c., become invalid\nbecause the absence of manifoldness deprives them of their objects; just as\nthe idea of a man becomes invalid after the right idea of the post (which at\nfirst had been mistaken for a man) has presented itself. Moreover, all the\ntexts embodying injunctions and prohibitions will lose their purport if the\ndistinction on which their validity depends\n\np. 324\n\ndoes not really exist. And further, the entire body of doctrine which refers\nto final release will collapse, if the distinction of teacher and pupil on\nwhich it depends is not real. And if the doctrine of release is untrue, how\ncan we maintain the truth of the absolute unity of the Self, which forms an\nitem of that doctrine?\n\nThese objections, we reply, do not damage our position because the entire\ncomplex of phenomenal existence is considered as true as long as the knowledge\nof Brahman being the Self of all has not arisen; just as the phantoms of a\ndream are considered to be true until the sleeper wakes. For as long as a\nperson has not reached the true knowledge of the unity of the Self, so long it\ndoes not enter his mind that the world of effects with its means and objects\nof right knowledge and its results of actions is untrue; he rather, in\nconsequence of his ignorance, looks on mere effects (such as body, offspring,\nwealth, &c.) as forming part of and belonging to his Self, forgetful of\nBrahman being in reality the Self of all. Hence, as long as true knowledge\ndoes not present itself, there is no reason why the ordinary course of secular\nand religious activity should not hold on undisturbed. The case is analogous\nto that of a dreaming man who in his dream sees manifold things, and, up to\nthe moment of waking, is convinced that his ideas are produced by real\nperception without suspecting the perception to be a merely apparent one.--But\nhow (to restate an objection raised above) can the Vedanta-texts if untrue\nconvey information about the true being of Brahman? We certainly do not\nobserve that a man bitten by a rope-snake (i.e. a snake falsely imagined in a\nrope) dies, nor is the water appearing in a mirage used for drinking or\nbathing 1.--This objection, we reply, is without force (because as a matter of\nfact we do see real effects to result from unreal causes), for we observe that\ndeath sometimes takes place from imaginary venom, (when a man imagines himself\nto have been bitten by a venomous snake,)\n\np. 325\n\nand effects (of what is perceived in a dream) such as the bite of a snake or\nbathing in a river take place with regard to a dreaming person.--But, it will\nbe said, these effects themselves are unreal!--These effects themselves, we\nreply, are unreal indeed; but not so the consciousness which the dreaming\nperson has of them. This consciousness is a real result; for it is not\nsublated by the waking consciousness. The man who has risen from sleep does\nindeed consider the effects perceived by him in his dream such as being bitten\nby a snake, bathing in a river, &c. to be unreal, but he does not on that\naccount consider the consciousness he had of them to be unreal likewise.--(We\nremark in passing that) by this fact of the consciousness of the dreaming\nperson not being sublated (by the waking consciousness) the doctrine of the\nbody being our true Self is to be \'considered as refuted  1.--Scripture also\n(in the passage, \'If a man who is engaged in some sacrifice undertaken for\nsome special wish sees in his dream a woman, he is to infer therefrom success\nin his work\') declares that by the unreal phantom of a dream a real result\nsuch as prosperity may be obtained. And, again, another scriptural passage,\nafter having declared that from the observation of certain unfavourable omens\na man is to conclude that he will not live long, continues \'if somebody sees\nin his dream a black man with black teeth and that man kills him,\' intimating\nthereby that by the unreal dream-phantom a real fact, viz. death, is notified.\n--It is, moreover, known from the experience of persons who carefully observe\npositive and negative instances that such and such dreams are auspicious\nomens, others the reverse. And (to quote another example that something true\ncan result from or be known through something untrue) we see that the\nknowledge of the real sounds A. &c. is reached by means of the unreal written\nletters. Moreover, the reasons which establish the unity of the\n\np. 326\n\n[paragraph continues] Self are altogether final, so that subsequently to them\nnothing more is required for full satisfaction 1. An injunction as, for\ninstance, \'He is to sacrifice\' at once renders us desirous of knowing what is\nto be effected, and by what means and in what manner it is to be effected; but\npassages such as, \'Thou art that,\' \'I am Brahman,\' leave nothing to be desired\nbecause the state of consciousness produced by them has for its object the\nunity of the universal Self. For as long as something else remains a desire is\npossible; but there is nothing else which could be desired in addition to the\nabsolute unity of Brahman. Nor can it be maintained that such states of\nconsciousness do not actually arise; for scriptural passages such as, \'He\nunderstood what he said\' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 18, 2), declare them to occur, and\ncertain means are enjoined to bring them about, such as the hearing (of the\nVeda from a teacher) and the recital of the sacred texts. Nor, again, can such\nconsciousness be objected to on the ground either of uselessness or of\nerroneousness, because, firstly, it is seen to have for its result the\ncessation of ignorance, and because, secondly, there is no other kind of\nknowledge by which it could be sublated. And that before the knowledge of the\nunity of the Self has been reached the whole real-unreal course of ordinary\nlife, worldly as well as religious, goes on unimpeded, we have already\nexplained. When, however, final authority having intimated the unity of the\nSelf, the entire course of the world which was founded on the previous\ndistinction is sublated, then there is no longer any opportunity for assuming\na Brahman comprising in itself various elements.\n\nBut--it may be said--(that would not be a mere assumption, but) Scripture\nitself, by quoting the parallel instances of clay and so on, declares itself\nin favour of a Brahman\n\np. 327\n\ncapable of modification; for we know from experience that clay and similar\nthings do undergo modifications.--This objection--we reply--is without force,\nbecause a number of scriptural passages, by denying all modification of\nBrahman, teach it to be absolutely changeless (ku _t_ astha). Such passages\nare, \'This great unborn Self; undecaying, undying, immortal, fearless, is\nindeed Brahman\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 25); \'That Self is to be described by No,\nno\' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 26); \'It is neither coarse nor fine\' (B _ri_. Up.\nIII, 8, 8). For to the one Brahman the two qualities of being subject to\nmodification and of being free from it cannot both be ascribed. And if you\nsay, \'Why should they not be both predicated of Brahman (the former during the\ntime of the subsistence of the world, the latter during the period of\nreabsorption) just as rest and motion may be predicated (of one body at\ndifferent times)?\' we remark that the qualification, \'absolutely changeless\'\n(ku _t_ astha), precludes this. For the changeless Brahman cannot be the\nsubstratum of varying attributes. And that, on account of the negation of all\nattributes, Brahman really is eternal and changeless has already been\ndemonstrated.--Moreover, while the cognition of the unity of Brahman is the\ninstrument of final release, there is nothing to show that any independent\nresult is connected with the view of Brahman, by undergoing a modification,\npassing over into the form of this world. Scripture expressly declares that\nthe knowledge of the changeless Brahman being the universal Self leads to a\nresult; for in the passage which begins, \'That Self is to be described by No,\nno,\' we read later on, \'O _G_ anaka, you have indeed reached fearlessness\' (B\n_ri_. Up. IV, 2, 4). We have then 1 to accept the following conclusion that,\nin the sections treating of Brahman, an independent result belongs only to the\nknowledge of Brahman as devoid of all attributes and distinctions, and that\nhence whatever is stated as having no special fruit of its own--as, for\ninstance, the passages about Brahman modifying itself into the form of this\n\np. 328\n\nworld--is merely to be applied as a means for the cognition of the absolute\nBrahman, but does not bring about an independent result; according to the\nprinciple that whatever has no result of its own, but is mentioned in\nconnexion with something else which has such a result, is subordinate to the\nlatter  1. For to maintain that the result of the knowledge of Brahman\nundergoing modifications would be that the Self (of him who knows that) would\nundergo corresponding modifications  2 would be inappropriate, as the state of\nfilial release (which the soul obtains through the knowledge of Brahman) is\neternally unchanging.\n\nBut, it is objected, he who maintains the nature of Brahman to be changeless\nthereby contradicts the fundamental tenet according to which the Lord is the\ncause of the world, since the doctrine of absolute unity leaves no room for\nthe distinction of a Ruler and something ruled.--This objection we ward off by\nremarking that omniscience, &c. (i.e. those qualities which belong to Brahman\nonly in so far as it is related to a world) depend on the evolution of the\ngerminal principles called name and form, whose essence is Nescience. The\nfundamental tenet which we maintain (in accordance with such scriptural\npassages as, \'From that Self sprang ether,\' &c.; Taitt. Up. II, 1; is that the\ncreation, sustentation, and reabsorption of the world proceed from an\nomniscient, omnipotent Lord, not from a non-intelligent pradhana or any other\nprinciple. Thai tenet we have stated in I, 1, 4, and here we do not teach\nanything contrary to it.--But how, the question may be asked, can you make\nthis last assertion while all the while you maintain the absolute unity and\nnon-duality of the Self?--Listen how. Belonging to the Self, as it were, of\nthe omniscient Lord, there are name and form, the figments of Nescience, not\nto be defined either\n\np. 329\n\nas being (i.e. Brahman), nor as different from it 1, the germs of the entire\nexpanse of the phenomenal world, called in _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti the\nillusion (maya), power ( _s_ akti), or nature (prak _ri_ ti) of the omniscient\nLord. Different from them is the omniscient Lord himself, as we learn from\nscriptural passages such as the following, \'He who is called ether is the\nrevealer of all forms and names; that within which these forms and names are\ncontained is Brahman\' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 14, 1); \'Let me evolve names and\nforms\' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 3, 2); \'He, the wise one, who having divided all forms\nand given all names, sits speaking (with those names)\' (Taitt. \xc3\x82r. III, 12,\n7); \'He who makes the one seed manifold\' ( _S_ ve. Up. VI, l2).--Thus the Lord\ndepends (as Lord) upon the limiting adjuncts of name and form, the products of\nNescience; just as the universal ether depends (as limited ether, such as the\nether of a jar, &c.) upon the limiting adjuncts in the shape of jars, pots,\n&c. He (the Lord) stands in the realm of the phenomenal in the relation of a\nruler to the so-called _g_ ivas (individual souls) or cognitional Selfs (vi _g\n\xc3\xb1_anatman), which indeed are one with his own Self--just as the portions of\nether enclosed in jars and the like are one with the universal ether--but are\nlimited by aggregates of instruments of action (i.e. bodies) produced from\nname and form, the presentations of Nescience. Hence the Lord\'s being a Lord,\nhis omniscience, his omnipotence, &c. all depend on the limitation due to the\nadjuncts whose Self is Nescience; while in reality none of these qualities\nbelong to the Self whose true nature is cleared, by right knowledge, from all\nadjuncts whatever. Thus Scripture also says, \'Where one sees nothing else,\nhears nothing else, understands nothing else, that is the Infinite\' ( _Kh_.\nUp. VII, 24, 1); \'But when the Self only has become all this, how should he\nsee another?\' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 13.) In this manner the Vedanta-texts\ndeclare that for him who has reached the\n\np. 330\n\nstate of truth and reality the whole apparent world does not exist. The\nBhagavadgita also (\'The Lord is not the cause of actions, or of the capacity\nof performing actions, or of the connexion of action and fruit; all that\nproceeds according to its own nature. The Lord receives no one\'s sin or merit.\nKnowledge is enveloped by Ignorance; hence all creatures are deluded;\' Bha.\nGi. V, 14; 15) declares that in reality the relation of Ruler and ruled does\nnot exist. That, on the other hand, all those distinctions are valid, as far\nas the phenomenal world is concerned, Scripture as well as the Bhagavadgita\nstates; compare B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22, \'He is the Lord of all, the king of all\nthings, the protector of all things; he is a bank and boundary, so that these\nworlds may not be confounded;\' and Bha. Gi. XVIII, 61, \'The Lord, O Ar _g_\nuna, is seated in the region of the heart of all beings, turning round all\nbeings, (as though) mounted on a machine, by his delusion.\' The Sutrakara also\nasserts the non-difference of cause and effect only with regard to the state\nof Reality; while he had, in the preceding Sutra, where he looked to the\nphenomenal world, compared Brahman to the ocean, &c., that comparison resting\non the assumption of the world of effects not yet having been refuted (i.e.\nseen to be unreal).--The view of Brahman as undergoing modifications will,\nmoreover, be of use in the devout meditations on the qualified (sagu _n_ a)\nBrahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[320:1](sbe34153.htm#fr_282) Pari _n_ amavadam avalambyapatato virodha _m_\nsamadhaya vivartavadam a _s_ ritya paramasamadhanam aha. \xc3\x82n.
