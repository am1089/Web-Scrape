There was a solitary, everlasting kudum tree\non one shore. The Raja enquired,--"O great king! how did that kudum tree\nescape?" The sage said, On one occasion the bird of Vishnu having ambrosia in\nits beak, alighted on that tree; a drop fell from its bill, and for this\nreason, that tree escaped. Having proceeded thus far in the narration, Shree\nShookdeo Jee said to the Raja,--O great king! Shree Krishnu Chund Jee having\ndetermined upon the destruction of Kalee, whilst engaged in playing at ball,\nclimbed up the kudum. tree; and as one of his companions threw the ball from\nbelow, it fell into the Jumna, and Shree Krishnu jumped in at the same time.\nHaving heard the sound of his jumping in, Kalee began to vomit forth poison,\nand hissing flames to say, "Who is this that can live so long in the\nwhirlpool? Perhaps the undecayable tree, not able to bear my heat, has fallen\ninto\n\np. 62\n\nthe water, broken in pieces; or some great beast or bird has come, the noise\nof which is still heard." Having thus said the serpent vomited forth poison\nfrom a hundred and ten hoods, while Shree Krishnu continued swimming. At this\ntime, his companions, weeping and stretching out their hands, called out; the\ncows with their mouths open ran about on all sides, lowing and panting; the\ncowherds apart were saying, "Krishnu come out quickly; otherwise, what answer\nshall we give, if we go home without you?" They were grieved, and continued\nspeaking thus, when one of them went to Brindabun, and mentioned, that Shree\nKrishnu had jumped into the whirlpool of Kalee. On hearing this, Rohnee,\nJusodha and Nund, with the cowherdesses and cowherds, came running out\nweeping, and tumbling over each other on the way, reached the whirlpool all\ntogether. Not seeing Shree Krishnu there, Nund\'s wife being agitated, rushed\nstraight forward to throw herself into the waters. The cowherdesses,\ninterposing, laid hold of her; and the cowherds\' children having seized Nund\nJee, thus addressed him--"Having left the great forest, we have come into this\none; nevertheless devils have vexed us exceedingly. Great good fortune has\nbefallen from evil spirits, (that is, Krishnu has obtained many successes over\nthem) now how will Huri come forth from the whirlpool?" In the meantime,\nBuldeo Jee arrived there also after them, and explained to all the inhabitants\nof Bruj--"The immortal Krishnu will come forth immediately; why are you sad? I\ndid not come with him to-day; Huri has gone into the whirlpool without me."\nHaving told so much of the story, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O great king! whilst Bulram Jee was thus instilling confidence\ninto all the inhabitants of Bruj, Shree Krishnu went swimming close to Kalee,\nwho came, and wound himself round his whole body. Upon this Shree Krishnu\nbecame so large, that having quitted him, Kalee came into the jungle. When\nhissing, he attacked Krishnu with his hoods, he guarded himself. Seeing that\nthe inhabitants\n\np. 63\n\nof Bruj were very much grieved, Shree Krishnu, having jumped up suddenly, sat\nall at once on Kalee\'s head. Having the weight of three worlds, Krishnu was\nvery heavy: he continued dancing on the different hoods, and beat time with\nhis foot. Upon this, Kalee began to die from the weight, and having dashed his\nhoods against the ground, put out his tongues, from which streams of blood\nflowed. When all pride of his poison and strength had departed, he thought\n"That the first man had descended upon the earth; otherwise, who has such\npower that he could escape from my poison?" Thinking thus, and having\nabandoned all hope of life, he remained stupified with fear. The serpent\'s\nwife then came and joining her hands, and bowing her head, said to Shree\nKrishnu Chund in a supplicating tone, "O great king! you have done well in\nhaving destroyed the pride of this tyrannous and presumptuous creature; he has\nbeen fortunate in having now seen you--the feet, which Bruhmu and all the\nother gods contemplate, offering up prayers with devout austerity, shine\nconspicuously on the head of Kalee." Having spoken thus, she said again, "O\ngreat king! have compassion on me, and release Kalee; if not, destroy me also\nwith him; because it is proper for a wife without her husband, (that is,\ndeprived of her husband,) to die: and if you consider, he is not all in fault,\nthis is the custom of our kind, that by having milk given us to drink, our\npoison increases." Having heard this speech of the serpent\'s wife, Shree\nKrishnu Chund jumped down from Kalee\'s head. Then Kalee, making an obeisance\nand joining his hands, said, "Lord! be pleased to forgive my offence: I,\nthrough ignorance, attacked you with my hoods; I am a serpent of an inferior\ncaste, whence could I have the intelligence to recognize you?" Shree Krishnu\nsaid, "What has happened, has happened; but do not live here any longer, go\nand dwell with your family in the island of Kounuck." On hearing this, Kalee\nsaid with fear and trembling, "O lord of liberality! if I go there, the bird,\nupon which Vishnu rides,\n\np. 64\n\nwill eat me up; from dread of which I ran off, and have come here."\n\nShree Krishnu said, "Go there now without fear; no one will say any thing to\nyou, after having seen the marks of my feet on your head." Having thus spoken,\nand sent for the bird of Vishnu, Shree Krishnu Chund dissipated the fears of\nKalee\'s mind. Then Kalee having offered up devotion in the manner prescribed,\nwith perfumes, lamps and consecrated food, and having placed many gifts before\nKrishnu, joining his hands, said in a supplicatory tone, after he had obtained\npermission to depart--"You have danced for four ghurees on my forehead: Lord!\nremember this act of friendship." Thus having spoken, and made an obeisance,\nKalee went with his family to the island of Kounuck, and Shree Krishnu Chund\ncame out of the water.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVIII](psa19.htm)\n\n'
