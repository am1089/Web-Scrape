Death said: 'The Self-existent pierced the openings (of the senses) so\nthat they turn forward: therefore man looks forward, not backward into\nhimself. Some wise man, however, with his eyes closed and wishing for\nimmortality, saw the Self behind.'\n\n2\\. 'Children follow after outward pleasures, and fall into the snare of wide-\nspread death. Wise men only, knowing the nature of what is immortal, do not\nlook for anything stable here among things unstable.'\n\n3\\. 'That by which we know form, taste, smell, sounds, and loving touches, by\nthat also we know what exists besides. This is that (which thou hast asked\nfor).'\n\n4\\. 'The wise, when he knows that that by which he perceives all objects in\nsleep or in waking is the great omnipresent Self, grieves no more.'\n\n5\\. 'He who knows this living soul which eats honey (perceives objects) as\nbeing the Self, always near, the Lord of the past and the future, henceforward\nfears no more. This is that.'\n\n6\\. 'He who (knows) him 1 who was born first from\n\np. 16\n\nthe brooding heat 1 (for he was born before the water), who, entering into the\nheart, abides therein, and was perceived from the elements. This is that.'\n\n7\\. '(He who knows) Aditi also, who is one with all deities, who arises with\nPra _n_ a (breath or Hira _n_ yagarbha), who, entering into the heart, abides\ntherein, and was born from the elements. This is that.'\n\n8\\. 'There is Agni (fire), the all-seeing, hidden in the two fire-sticks,\nwell-guarded like a child (in the womb) by the mother, day after day to be\nadored by men when they awake and bring oblations. This is that.'\n\n9\\. 'And that whence the sun rises, and whither it goes to set, there all the\nDevas are contained, and no one goes beyond. This is that 2.'\n\n10\\. 'What is here (visible in the world), the same is there (invisible in\nBrahman); and what is there, the same is here. He who sees any difference here\n(between Brahman and the world), goes from death to death.'\n\n11\\. 'Even by the mind this (Brahman) is to be obtained, and then there is no\ndifference whatsoever. He goes from death to death who sees any difference\nhere.'\n\n12\\. 'The person (purusha), of the size of a thumb 3, stands in the middle of\nthe Self (body?), as lord of the past and the future, and henceforward fears\nno more. This is that.'\n\n13\\. 'That person, of the size of a thumb, is like a light without smoke, lord\nof the past and the future, he is the same to-day and to-morrow. This is\nthat.'\n\np. 17\n\n14\\. 'As rain-water that has fallen on a mountain-ridge runs down the rocks on\nall sides, thus does he, who sees a difference between qualities, run after\nthem on all sides.'\n\n15\\. 'As pure water poured into pure water remains the same, thus, O Gautama,\nis the Self of a thinker who knows.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[15:1](sbe15013.htm#fr_119) The first manifestation of Brahman, commonly\ncalled Hira _n_ yagarbha, which springs from the tapas of Brahman. Afterwards\nonly water and the rest of the elements become manifested. The text of these\nverses is abrupt, possibly corrupt. The two accusatives, tish _th_ antam and\ntish _th_ antim, seem to me to require veda to be supplied from verse 4.\n\n[16:1](sbe15013.htm#fr_120) Cf. s _ri_ sh _t_ ikrama.\n\n[16:2](sbe15013.htm#fr_121) Cf.
