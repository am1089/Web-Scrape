And the intention of entering (can) not (be referred) to the effected\n(Brahman).\n\nMoreover the intention of entering into which is expressed\n\np. 393\n\nin the passage, 'I enter the hall of Pra _g_ apati, the house' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 14, 1), cannot have the lower Brahman for its object. For the\nimmediately preceding passage, 'That within which these forms and names are\ncontained is the Brahman,' shows that the highest Brahman, different in nature\nfrom the effected one, is the general subject-matter; and the subsequent\npassage, 'I am the glory of the Brahmans,' represents the soul as the Self of\nall; it being known from another scriptural passage that 'Glory' is a name of\nthe highest Brahman, 'There is no likeness of him whose name is great glory'\n(Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XXXII, 3). And in the vidya of Brahman within the heart it\nis said of this same entering the house that it is preceded by going 1, 'There\nis the city of Brahman Apara _g_ ita, and the golden hall built by Prabhu' (\n_Kh_. Up. VIII, 5, 3). And that the performing of a journey is intended\nfollows also from the use of the verb 'pad,' which denotes going (prapadye, I\nenter).--The other (prima facie) view therefore is that all the passages about\nthe soul's going refer to the highest Brahman.\n\nThese two views have been embodied by the teacher in the Sutras; one in the\nSutras 7-11, the other in the Sutras 12-14. Now the arguments contained in the\nformer set are capable of proving the fallaciousness of the arguments in the\nlatter set, but not vice versa; from which it follows that the former set\nstates the final view and the latter set the prima facie view only.--For\nnobody can compel us to accept the primary sense of a word (such as Brahman)\neven where it is impossible to do so.--And although met with in a chapter that\ntreats of the highest knowledge, the reference to the going to Brahman--which\nbelongs to another kind of knowledge--may be explained as aiming merely at the\nglorification of the highest knowledge (not at teaching that the going to\nBrahman is the result of higher\n\np. 394\n\nknowledge).--And with reference to the passage, 'I enter the hall of Pra _g_\napati the house,' there is no reason why we should not separate that passage\nfrom what precedes and refer the intention of entering to the effected\nBrahman. And the qualified Brahman also may be spoken of as being the Self of\nall, as shown by other passages such as 'He to whom all works, all desires\nbelong,' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 2). The texts about the going therefore all\nbelong to the lower knowledge.--Others again, in accordance with the general\nprinciple that the earlier Sutras set forth the prima facie view, while the\nlater ones contain the siddhanta view, maintain that the passages about the\nsoul's going fall within the sphere of the higher knowledge. But this is\nimpossible, because nothing may go to the highest Brahman. 'Omnipresent and\neternal like the ether;' 'The Brahman which is visible, not invisible, the\nSelf that is within all' (B _ri_. Up. III, 4, 1); 'Self only is all this' (\n_Kh_. Up. VII, 25, 2); 'Brahman only is all this, it is the best' (Mu. Up. II,\n2, 11): from all these passages we ascertain that the highest Brahman is\npresent everywhere, within everything, the Self of everything, and of such a\nBrahman it is altogether impossible that it ever should be the goal of going.\nFor we do not go to what is already reached; ordinary experience rather tells\nus that a person goes to something different from him.--But we observe in\nordinary experience also that something already reached may become an object\nof going, in so far as qualified by a different place; a man living on the\nearth, e.g. goes to the earth, in so far as he goes to another place on the\nearth. In the same way we see that a child reaches the adult state which in\nreality belongs to the child's identical Self, but is qualified by a\ndifference of time. Analogously Brahman also may be an object of going in so\nfar as it is possessed of all kinds of powers.--This may not be, we reply,\nbecause scripture expressly negatives Brahman's possessing any distinctive\nqualities.--'Without parts, without actions, tranquil, without fault, without\ntaint' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 19); 'Neither coarse nor fine, neither short nor\nlong' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 8); 'He who is without and within, unproduced '(Mu.\nUp. II, 1, 2);\n\np. 395\n\n[paragraph continues] 'This great, unborn Self, undecaying, undying, immortal,\nfearless, is indeed Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 25); 'He is to be described\nby No, no!' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 26); from all these scriptural texts, as well\nas from Sm _ri_ ti and reasoning, it follows that the highest Self cannot be\nassumed to possess any differences depending on time or space or anything\nelse, and cannot therefore become the object of going. The cases of places on\nthe earth and of the different ages of man are by no means analogous; for they\nare affected by differences of locality and so on, and therefore can be gone\nto or reached.--Nor will it avail our opponent to say that Brahman possesses\nmanifold powers, because scripture declares it to be the cause of the world's\norigination, sustentation, and final retractation; for those passages which\ndeny difference have no other sense (but just the absolute denial of all\ndifference).--But in the same way also those passages which state the\norigination and so on of the world have no other sense! (i.e. cannot be\nunderstood to teach anything but just the origination and so on of the world).\n--This is not so, we reply; for what they aim at teaching is the absolute\noneness of Brahman. For texts which by means of the simile of the lump of\nclay, &c., teach that only that which is, viz. Brahman, is true, while\neverything effected is untrue, cannot aim at teaching the origination, &c. of\nthe world.--But why should the passages about the origination, &c. of the\nworld be subordinate to those which deny all difference, and not vice versa?--\nBecause, we reply, the texts which negative all difference effect the\ncessation of all desire. For when the absolute oneness, permanence, and purity\nof the Self have once been apprehended, we cognize that the highest aim of man\nhas been attained, and therefore conceive no further desires. Compare the\nfollowing texts: 'What trouble, what sorrow can there be to him who beholds\nthat unity?' (\xc3\x8e _s_ a-up. 7); 'Thou hast reached fearlessness, O _G_ anaka'(B\n_ri_. Up. IV, 2, 4); 'He who knows does not fear anything; he does not\ndistress himself with the thought, Why did I not do what is good? Why did I do\nwhat is bad?' (Taitt. Up. II, 9.) This also follows from our observing that\nthose who know realise\n\np. 396\n\ncontentment of mind; and from the fact that scripture blames the false notion\nof (the reality of) effects, 'From death to death goes he who sees here any\ndifference' (Ka. Up. II. 4, 10). The texts negativing all difference cannot\ntherefore be understood as subordinate to other texts. Those texts, on the\nother hand, which speak of the origination of the world and so on have no\nsimilar power of conveying a sense which effects cessation of all desire. At\nthe same time it is manifest that they have another (than their literal)\nmeaning. For the text, after having said at first, 'Of this shoot sprung up\nknow that it cannot be without a root' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 3), declares in the\nend that Being which is the root of the world is the only object of cognition.\nSimilarly Taitt. Up. III, 1. 'That from which these beings are born, that by\nwhich when born they live, that into which they enter at their death, seek to\nknow that; that is Brahman.' As thus the passages about origination and so on\naim at teaching the unity of the Self, Brahman cannot be viewed as possessing\nmanifold powers, and cannot therefore be the object of the action of going.--\nAnd, as already explained under IV, 2, 13, also the text B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 6\n('Of him the pra _n_ as do not depart; being Brahman he goes to Brahman'),\ndenies any going to the highest Brahman.\n\nMoreover, on the hypothesis of going, that which goes, i.e. the individual\nsoul, must be either a part of Brahman to which it goes, or an effect of\nBrahman, or different from Brahman; for if the two were absolutely identical\nno going could take place.--Well, what then?--We reply as follows. If, in the\nfirst place, the soul is a part of Brahman, it cannot go to it, since the\nwhole is permanently reached by the part. Besides, the hypothesis of whole and\nparts cannot be applied to Brahman, which is acknowledged to be without parts.\n--The same objection lies against the hypothesis of the soul being an effect\nof Brahman; for also that which passes over into an effect is permanently\nreached by the effect. A jar made of clay does not exist apart from the clay\nwhich constitutes its Self; were it so apart it would cease to be. And on both\nhypotheses, as that to\n\np. 397\n\nwhich the parts or the effects would belong, i.e. Brahman is altogether\nunchanging, its entering into the Sa _m_ sara state could not be accounted\nfor.--Let then, in the third place, the soul be different from Brahman. In\nthat case it must be either of atomic size, or infinite, or of some\nintervening extent. If it is omnipresent, it cannot go anywhere. If it is of\nsome middling extent, it cannot be permanent. If it is of atomic size, the\nfact of sensation extending over the whole body cannot be accounted for. The\ntwo hypotheses of atomic and middling extent have moreover been refuted at\nlength in a former part of this work (II, 3, 19 ff.). And from the soul's\nbeing different from the highest Brahman it also would follow that such texts\nas 'Thou art that' are futile. This latter objection also lies against the\ntheories of the soul being a part or an effect of Brahman. Nor can the\ndifficulty be got over by it being pleaded that a part and an effect are not\ndifferent from the whole and the causal substance; for that kind of oneness is\nnot oneness in the true literal sense--From all those three theories it\nmoreover equally follows that the soul cannot obtain final release, because\nits Sa _m_ sara condition could never come to an end. Or else, if that\ncondition should come to an end, it would follow that the very essence of the\nsoul perishes; for those theories do not admit that the (imperishable) Brahman\nconstitutes the Self of the soul.\n\nHere now some come forward with the following contention. Works of permanent\nobligation and works to be performed on special occasions are undertaken to\nthe end that harm may not spring up; such works as are due to special desires,\nand such as are forbidden, are eschewed, in order that neither the heavenly\nworld nor hell may be obtained, and those works whose fruits are to be enjoyed\nin the current bodily existence are exhausted by just that fruition. Hence, as\nafter the death of the present body, there is no cause for the origination of\na now body, that blessed isolation which consists in the soul's abiding within\nits own nature will accomplish itself for a man acting in the way described\nabove, even without the cognition of his\n\np. 398\n\n[paragraph continues] Self being identical with Brahman's Self.--All this is\ninadmissible, we reply, because there is no proof of it. For scripture nowhere\nteaches that he who desires release should conduct himself in the way\ndescribed. To say that because the Sa _m_ sara state depends on works, it will\ncease when works are absent, is an altogether arbitrary style of reasoning.\nAnd (whether arbitrary or not) this reasoning falls to the ground, because the\nabsence of the cause is something that cannot be ascertained. It may be\nsupposed that each living being has, in its former states of existence,\naccumulated many works which have part of them pleasant, part of them\nunpleasant results. As these works are such as to lead to contrary results,\nwhich cannot be enjoyed all of them at the same time, some works whose\nopportunity has come, build up the present state of existence; others sit\ninactive waiting for a place, a time, and operative causes (favourable to\nthem). As these latter works cannot thus be exhausted in the present state of\nexistence, we cannot definitely assert, even in the case of a man who conducts\nhimself as described above, that at the end of his present bodily existence\nall cause for a new bodily existence will be absent. The existence of a\nremainder of works is, moreover, established by scriptural and Sm _ri_ ti\npassages, such as, 'Those whose conduct has been good' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 10, 7);\n'Then with the remainder.'--But may not, an objection is raised, those\nremaining works be wiped out (even in the present existence) by the\nperformance of works of permanent obligation and such works as are due to\nspecial occasions?--This may not be, we reply, because the two sets of works\nare not of contrary nature. Where there is contrariety of nature, one thing\nmay be wiped out by another; but good deeds performed in previous states of\nexistence, and works of permanent obligation and so on (performed in the\npresent life), are both of them equally pure and therefore not of opposite\nnature. Bad works indeed, as being of impure nature, are opposed to works of\npermanent obligation, &c., and therefore may be extinguished by the latter.\nBut even from this admission it does not follow that the causes for a new\nembodied existence\n\np. 399\n\nare altogether absent; for those causes may be supplied by good deeds, and we\ndo not know that the evil works have been extinguished without a remainder.\nNor is there anything to prove that the performance of works of permanent\nobligation, &c., leads only to the non-origination of harm, and not at the\nsame time to the origination of new results (to be extinguished in future\nstates of existence); for it may happen that such new results spring up\ncollaterally. Thus \xc3\x82pastamba says, 'When a mango tree is planted for the sake\nof its fruits, it in addition gives shade and fragrance; thus additional\nadvantages spring from the performance of religious duty.'--Nor can anybody\nwho has not reached perfect knowledge promise to refrain altogether, from\nbirth to death, from all actions either forbidden or aiming at the fulfilment\nof special wishes for we observe that even the most perfect men commit faults,\nhowever minute. This may be a matter of doubt; all the same it remains true\nthat the absence of causes for a new existence cannot be known with certainty.\n--If, further, the soul's unity with Brahman's Self--which is to be realised\nthrough knowledge--is not acknowledged, the soul whose essential nature it is\nto be an agent and enjoyer cannot even desire the state of blissful isolation;\nfor a being cannot divorce itself from its true essence, not any more than\nfire can cease to be hot.--But, an objection is raised, what is of\ndisadvantage to the soul is the state of agentship and fruition in so far as\nactually produced, not its mere potentiality. Release of the soul may,\ntherefore, take place if only that actual condition is avoided while its\npotentiality remains.--This also, we reply, is not true: for as long as the\npotentiality exists it ill inevitably produce the actuality.--But, our\nopponent resumes, potentiality alone, without other co-operative causes, does\nnot produce its effect; as long therefore as it is alone it cannot, though\ncontinuing to exist, do any harm!--This also, we reply, is not valid; for the\nco-operative causes also are, potentially, permanently connected (with the\nacting and enjoying soul). If, therefore, the soul whose essence is acting and\nenjoying is not considered to possess fundamental identity with Brahman\n\np. 400\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--an identity to be realised by knowledge--there is not\nany chance of its obtaining final release. Scripture, moreover (in the\npassage, 'There is no other way to go,' Svet. Up. III, 8), denies that there\nis any other way to release but knowledge.--But if the soul is non-different\nfrom the highest Brahman, all practical existence comes to an end, because\nthen perception and the other means of right knowledge no longer act!--Not so,\nwe reply. Practical life will hold its place even then, just as dreamlife\nholds its place up to the moment of waking. Scripture, after having said that\nperception and the rest are operative in the sphere of those who have not\nreached true knowledge ('For where there is duality, as it were, there one\nsees the other,' &c.; B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15), goes on to show that those means\nof knowledge do not exist for those who possess that knowledge ('But when the\nwhole of him has become the Self, whereby should he see another,' &c.). As\nthus for him who knows the highest Brahman all cognition of something to be\ngone to, &c. is sublated his going cannot in any way be shown to be possible.\n\nTo what sphere then belong the scriptural texts about the soul's going?--To\nthe sphere of qualified knowledge, we reply. Accordingly the soul's going is\nmentioned in the chapter treating of the knowledge of the five fires, in the\nchapter treating of the knowledge of Brahman's couch, in the chapter treating\nof the knowledge of Agni Vai _s_ vanara ( _Kh_. Up. V, 3-10; Kau. Up. I; _Kh_.\nUp. V, 11-24). And where the soul's going is spoken of in a chapter treating\nof Brahman--(as e.g. in the passages, 'He leads them to Brahman,' &c., _Kh_.\nUp. IV, 15, 6, in a chapter treating of Brahman, as shown by 'Breath is\nBrahman,' &c., IV, 10, 5; and 'He departs upward,' &c., _Kh_. Up. VIII, 6, 5,\nin the chapter beginning 'There is this city of Brahman,' VIII, 1, 1)--such\nattributes as 'vamani,' i.e. Leader of blessings ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 15, 3), and\n'satyakama,' i.e. having true wishes, show that there the qualified Brahman\nhas to be meditated upon, and to that Brahman the soul can go. No passage, on\nthe other hand, speaks of the soul's going to the highest Brahman; while such\ngoing is specially\n\np. 401\n\ndenied in the passage, 'Of him the pra _n_ as do not depart.' In passages,\nagain, such as 'He who knows Brahman obtains the Highest' (Taitt. Up. II, 1),\nwe indeed meet with the verb 'to reach,' which has the sense of going; but\nbecause, as explained before, the reaching of another place is out of\nquestion, 'reaching' there denotes only the obtainment (realisation) of one's\nown nature, in so far as (through true knowledge) the expanse of names and\nforms which Nescience superimposes (on Brahman) is dissolved. Such passages\nare to be understood analogously to the text, 'Being Brahman he enters into\nBrahman' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 6).--Besides, if the going were understood as\nconnected with the highest Brahman, it could only subserve the purpose either\nof satisfying (the mind of him who knows) or of reflection. Now, a statement\nof the soul's going cannot produce any satisfaction in him who knows Brahman,\nsince satisfaction is already fully accomplished through his perfect\ncondition, bestowed on him by knowledge, of which he is immediately conscious.\nNor, on the other hand, can it be shown that reflection on the soul's going in\nany way subserves knowledge, which is conscious of eternally perfect\nblessedness, and has not for its fruit something to be accomplished.--For all\nthese reasons the soul's going falls within the sphere of the lower knowledge.\nAnd only in consequence of the distinction of the higher and lower Brahman not\nbeing ascertained, statements about the soul's going which apply to the lower\nBrahman are wrongly put in connexion with the higher Brahman.\n\nBut are there really two Brahmans, a higher one and a lower one?--Certainly\nthere are two! For scripture declares this, as e.g. in the passage, 'O\nSatyakama, the syllable Om is the higher and also the lower Brahman' (Pr. Up.\nV, 2).--What then is the higher Brahman, and what the lower?--Listen! Where\nthe texts, negativing all distinctions founded on name, form, and the like,\ndesignate Brahman by such terms as that which is not coarse and so on, the\nhigher Brahman is spoken of. Where, again, for the purpose of pious\nmeditation, the texts teach Brahman as qualified by some distinction depending\non name, form, and so on, using terms such as\n\np. 402\n\n[paragraph continues] 'He who consists of mind, whose body is pra _n_ a, whose\nshape is light' ( _Kh_. Up. III. 14, 2), that is the lower Brahman.--But is\nthere not room here for the objection that this distinction of a higher and a\nlower Brahman stultifies the scriptural texts asserting aduality?--Not so, we\nreply. That objection is removed by the consideration that name and form, the\nadjuncts (of the one real Brahman), are due to Nescience. Passages such as 'If\nhe desires the world of the fathers' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 2, 1), which the text\nexhibits in proximity to a meditation on the lower Brahman, show that the\nfruit of such meditation is lordship over the worlds; a fruit falling within\nthe sphere of the Sa _m_ sara, Nescience having not as yet been discarded. And\nas that fruit is bound to a special locality, there is nothing contradictory\nin the soul's going there in order to reach it. That the soul, although all-\npervading, is viewed as going because it enters into connexion with the buddhi\nand the rest of its adjuncts, just as general space enters into connexion with\njars and the like, we have explained under II, 3, 29.\n\nFor all these reasons the view of Badari as set forth in Sutra 7 is the final\none; while Sutra 12, which states _G_ aimini's opinion, merely sets forth\nanother view, to the end of the illumination of the learner's understanding.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[393:1](sbe38315.htm#fr_230) I am not quite sure which passage in the\ndaharavidya is supposed to prove that the entering of Brahman's house is\npreceded by going.
