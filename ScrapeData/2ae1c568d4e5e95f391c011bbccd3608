Two birds, inseparable friends, cling to the same tree. One of them eats\nthe sweet fruit, the other looks on without eating 1.\n\n2\\. On the same tree man sits grieving, immersed, bewildered by his own\nimpotence (an-i _s_ a). But when he sees the other lord (i _s_ a) contented\nand knows his glory, then his grief passes away 2.\n\n3\\. When the seer sees the brilliant maker and lord (of the world) as the\nPerson who has his source in Brahman, then he is wise, and shaking off good\nand evil, he reaches the highest oneness, free from passions;\n\n4\\. For he is the Breath shining forth in all beings, and he who understands\nthis becomes truly wise, not a talker only. He revels in the Self, he delights\nin the Self, and having performed his works (truthfulness, penance,\nmeditation, &c.) he rests, firmly established in Brahman, the best of those\nwho know Brahman 3.\n\np. 39\n\n5\\. By truthfulness, indeed, by penance, right knowledge, and abstinence must\nthat Self be gained; the Self whom spotless anchorites gain is pure, and like\na light within the body.\n\n6\\. The true prevails, not the untrue; by the true the path is laid out, the\nway of the gods (devayana _h_ ), on which the old sages, satisfied in their\ndesires, proceed to where there is that highest place of the True One.\n\n7\\. That (true Brahman) shines forth grand, divine., inconceivable, smaller\nthan small; it is far beyond what is far and yet near here, it is hidden in\nthe cave (of the heart) among those who see it even here.\n\n8\\. He is not apprehended by the eye, nor by speech, nor by the other senses,\nnot by penance or good works 1. When a man's nature has become purified by the\nserene light of knowledge, then he sees him, meditating on him as without\nparts.\n\n9\\. That subtle Self is to be known by thought ( _k_ etas) there where breath\nhas entered fivefold, for every thought of men is interwoven with the senses,\nand when thought is purified, then the Self arises.\n\n10\\. Whatever state a man, whose nature is purified imagines, and whatever\ndesires he desires (for himself or for others) 2, that state he conquers and\n\np. 40\n\nthose desires he obtains. Therefore let every man who desires happiness\nworship the man who knows the Self 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[38:1](sbe15020.htm#fr_180) Cf. Rv. I, 164, 20; Nir. XIV, 30; _S_ vet. Up. IV,\n6; Ka _th_. Up. III, 1.\n\n[38:2](sbe15020.htm#fr_181) Cf. _S_ vet. Up. IV, 7.\n\n[38:3](sbe15020.htm#fr_182) The commentator states that, besides atmarati _h_\nkriyavan, there was another reading, viz. atmaratikriyavan. This probably owed\nits origin to a difficulty felt in reconciling kriyavan, performing acts, with\nthe brahmavida _m_ varish _th_ a _h_ , the best of those who know Brahman,\nworks being utterly incompatible with a true knowledge of Brahman. Kriyavan,\nhowever, as _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara points out, may mean here simply, having performed\nmeditation and other acts conducive to a knowledge of Brahman. Probably\ntruthfulness, p. 39 penance, &c., mentioned in the next following verse, are\nthe kriyas or works intended. For grammatical reasons also this reading is\npreferable. But the last foot esha brahmavida _m_ varish _th_ a _h_ is clearly\ndefective. If we examine the commentary, we see that _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara read\nbrahmanish _th_ a _h_ , and that he did not read esha, which would give us the\ncorrect metre, brahmanish _th_ o brahmavida _m_ varish _th_ a _h_.\n\n[39:1](sbe15020.htm#fr_183) Cf. Ka _th_. Up. VI, 12.\n\n[39:2](sbe15020.htm#fr_184) Cf. B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. I, 4, 15.\n\n[40:1](sbe15020.htm#fr_185) All this is said by the commentator to refer to a\nknowledge of the conditioned Brahman only.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2](sbe15021.htm)\n\n"
