I will now narrate how Sissoopal\'s brothers,\nBukrudunt and Bidooruth, were slain; from the time Sissoopal was killed, the\ntwo brothers constantly thought, how they might revenge themselves on Shree\nKrishnu Chund for their brother\'s death. At length, on the death of Salub and\nDoobid, they advanced against the city of Dwarka with all their army; and\nhaving encompassed it on all sides, began to discharge all kinds of engines\nand weapons of war against it. There was great commotion in the city; on\nhearing the clamour Moorari ascended his chariot. Shree Krishnu Chund Jee\nwent, after this, outside the city, and stood where the two demons in great\nwrath, and with arms in their hands, were prepared for battle. On seeing\nKrishnu, Bukrudunt said, with great haughtiness, "Ho Krishnu! first bring into\nplay all thy warlike weapons, and afterwards I will slay thee, my reason for\ntelling thee this is, that at the time of death thou mayest not have to regret\nnot having attacked Bukrudunt; thou hast destroyed very mighty men, but shall\nnot now escape alive from me."\n\nO great king! having made many such wicked speeches, Bukrudunt threw a club at\nKrishnu, which Huri easily cut off and brought to the ground; then, taking\nanother club,\n\np. 390\n\nhe engaged in a severe contest with Huri, when Bhugwan killed and brought him\nto the ground, and his life issuing forth went into the mouth of Krishnu. When\nBidooruth beheld the death of Bukrudunt, he advanced to the attack, and Shree\nKrishnu Jee sent forth the quoit, Soodursun, who cut off his head, and brought\nit to the ground, with the crown and earrings; he afterwards slew and put to\nflight the whole army of the demons: at that time, the delighted gods rained\ndown flowers; celestial choristers and bards celebrated with songs the renown\nof Huri; all the demi-gods, holy men and celestial dancers, ascending\nchariots, raised cries of exultation and victory. They then all said to\nKrishnu, "Your pastimes are infinite; no one can understand the secret of\nthem. First, Hirunkusyp and Hirnakoos were born; afterwards Rawun and\nKoombhkurun, and now Duntbukru and Sissoopal; you have killed them three\ntimes, and granted them the highest release, for this reason your state and\nnature are not understood by any one."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, the gods made an obeisance to Krishnu, and\ndeparted; and Huri began to say to Bulram Jee, "Brother! the Kouruvus and\nPanduvus have fought; what shall we do?" Buldeo Jee replied, "O abode of\nkindness! please do me the favour to go to Hustinapoor, and I will come there\nby and bye, after having gone on pilgrimage to holy places."\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narration, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! Shree Krishnu Chund Jee, having heard this suggestion, went to\nKoorchetru, the country about Delhi, where the Kouruvus and Panduvus were\ncarrying on a great war; and Bulram Jee went forth on pilgrimage; whilst\nengaged in visiting the places of pilgrimage Buldeo arrived at Neemkhar; he\nthere beheld that on one side holy men and sages were engaged in sacrifices;\nand on another side in an assembly of sages and holy Soot Jee, seated on a\nthrone, was reading histories. On beholding Bulram, Sounuk\n\np. 391\n\nand all the sages, and saints rose up and made obeisance, and Soot Jee\nremained looking at him, seated on a cushion on the throne.\n\nO great king! on Soot Jee\'s not rising, Bulram Jee said to Sounuk and all the\nsages, and saints, "Who has made this fool a speaker, and given him the seat\nof Byas? A speaker should be religious, a man of discrimination and of wisdom;\nthis man is without good [qualities](errata.htm#23), avaricious and proud;\nagain, it is necessary, that he should be free from covetousness, and be\nvirtuous; this man is very greedy and selfish. The seat of Byas does not\nbecome one, who is devoid of intellect, and judgment. It would not much\nmatter, if we were to kill him; but we must have him removed hence." On\nhearing this Sounuk and all the great sages and saints, said most\nsubmissively, "O great king! you are brave, resolute, acquainted with all\nobservances and usages; whilst this man is a coward, irresolute, without\ndiscretion, proud and without intelligence, be pleased to forgive his fault,\nthat he is sitting upon the cushion of Byas, and because Bruhmu has placed him\nhere for the business of the sacrifice; the fool was puffed up with pride,\nbecause he was seated, and did not rise to make a salutation to you. This, O\nlord! is his fault, he has committed an error, but is a good man; it would be\na sin to kill Soot Jee, no one in the world would call it a good act; what you\nhave said to him will not be without advantage. Think of this in your mind."\n\nO great king! when Bulram Jee heard these words, he took up a blade of grass,\nand struck Soot Jee lightly, who died from the touch of it. On beholding this\nact, Sounuk and all the sages, uttering expressions of grief, and being very\nsad, said, "O great king! what was to be, has come to pass, but be pleased now\nto favor us by removing our anxiety." Bulram replied, "Tell me what your\ndesire is, and I will satisfy it." The sages said, "O great king! let there be\nno interruption in the performance of our sacrifice, this is our desire, be\npleased\n\np. 392\n\n"to fulfil it, and gain celebrity in the world." When the sages had thus\nspoken, Bulram Jee, acquainted with the secrets of the heart, caused Soot\nJee\'s son to be sent for; and having seated him on the cushion of Byas, said,\n"He will be more eloquent than his father, and I have conferred undying\ndignity upon him, and made him long lived, perform your sacrifice now, free\nfrom all anxiety."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXI](psa80.htm)\n\n'
