Vyasa said :-- O King! When the Devas were all defeated, S\xc2\x92umbha began to\ngovern all their kingdoms; thus one thousand years passed away. The Devas, on\nthe other hand, deprived of their kingdoms, were all drowned in an ocean of\ncares and anxieties; at last they began to feel very much and were greatly\nafflicted. They asked with reverence their own Guru Brihaspati, \xc2\x93O Guru! What\nare we to do now? O All knowing! You are the Great Muni; kindly say unto us if\nthere be any means by which we can get rid of this our present crisis. There\nare thousands of Vedic Mantrams which yield the desired results, if they are\nworshipped with due rites and ceremonies and if all the rules be observed\nthereof. O best of Munis! Many Yaj\xc3\xb1as are mentioned in the Vedas that yield\nall the desired results; you know them all; so kindly perform those Yaj\xc3\xb1as. Do\nall those ceremonies duly that are ordained in the Vedas for the killing of\nenemies; O Descendant of \xc3\x82ngirasa! You ought to perform as early as possible\nthose sacrifices for magical purposes to destroy the Danavas so that all our\nmiseries come to an end.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n8-22. Brihaspati said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord of the Suras! All the mantras mentioned in\nthe Vedas yield the desired results, but subservient to the Great Destiny\nonly; they do not give results of themselves but do so in obedience to to the\nlaws ordained by Nature. You all are the presiding Deities of the Vedic\nMantras; but, now, by the strange irony of Time, you are put to difficulties\nand troubles; what can I do now in this case? See! Indra, Ag _n_ i, Varu _n_\na, and other gods are invoked in sacrifices; how, then, can sacrificial\nceremonies do good when you are put to so great difficulties. Therefore there\nis no remedy to those which will take place unavoidably; but those who are\nwise declare that in such cases means are to be adopted. Some sages say that\nFate is strong but those who advocate the cause of taking remedial means say\nthat Fate is powerless; remedies or manly exertions lead to all success. But,\nO King of the Devas! The embodied souls ought to resort to both Fate and\nRemedies; it is never advisable to depend solely on Fate. Therefore, it is\nadvisable to think out again and again as far as one\xc2\x92s own Intellect goes, the\nbest remedies. O Devas! I have thought over again and again on this subject\nand say to you my opinion. Hear. In days of yore, the Bhagavati, being\nappeased, killed Mahi _s_ asura; and when you\n\n\n\np. 430\n\n\n\nall praised and chanted hymns to Her, She gave you this boon that She will\nremove all your sorrows and troubles no sooner you remember Her, and She told\nthat you all must remember Her whenever any difficulty would arise to you out\nof this Great Destiny. She would, then, free you all of your ocean of great\ndifficulties. Therefore do you all now go to the highly sacred and exquisitely\nbeautiful Himalayan mountains and worship the most worshipful Chandika Devi\nwith your love and devotion. Know all the rules of the Seed mantra of Maya and\nbe engaged in taking Her name accompanied with burnt offerings. I have come to\nknow, by Yogic power, that She will be pleased with You. I see that today your\ndifficulties will come to an end; there is not the least doubt in this. I have\nheard that the Devi resides always in the Himachal; if you worship and praise\nand chant hymns to Her, She will certainly grant you your desired boons.\nTherefore fully decide on this thing and go to the Himalayas. O Devas! She\nwill fulfil all your desires and carry out all your intentions.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n23-24. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus his words, the Devas departed to\nthe Himalayas and they became all merged in the devotional worship of the\nSupreme Goddess and began to meditate constantly in their hearts the Seed\nmantra of Maya (Hrim). They bowed down to the Goddess Maha Maya, the Discarder\nof all the fears of Her Bhaktas and began to chant hymns to Her with perfect\ndevotion.\n\n\n\n25-42. O Goddess! Salutation to Thee! O Thou, the Lord of the Universe! the\nLord of our hearts! Thou art the Everlasting Bliss and the Giver of bliss to\nthe Devas! Salutation to Thee! Thou art the Destroyer of the Danavas and Thou\nart the Giver of all desires of human beings. Thou canst be approached with\ndevotion. Salutation to Thee! O Thou, the Incarnate of all the Devas! Thy\nnames are endless; Thy forms are endless; none can count them. Thou residest\nalways as the Force Incarnate in all the actions, in the Creation,\nPreservation and Dissolution of Beings. O Goddess! Thou art the Memory,\nConstancy, Intelligence, Old Age. Thou art the nourishment, contentment; Thou\nupholdest all; Thou art the beauty, peace, good knowledge, prosperity and\nhappiness, Thou art the Goal, fame, and intellect and Thou art the Eternal\nSeed unmanifested. We now bow down to those forms of Thine through which Thou\ndost serve the purpose of the Devas in this world as we are now in need of\npeace. Thou art forgiveness and mercy; Thou art the Yoga Nidra (a state\nbetween sleep and wakefulness); Thou art the kindness and Thou residest in all\nthe beings in so many forms, great and grand, and so very celebrated; O\nGoddess! Thou hadst already served the cause of the gods in killing our\n\n\n\np. 431\n\n\n\ngreat enemy Mahi _s_ asura, puffed up with vanity. Therefore Thy mercy is well\nknown amongst the gods; what more, Thy mercy is known, since very ancient\ntimes and it is narrated in the Vedas. What wonder is there that a mother\nnourishes gladly her own sons and preserves them carefully! For Thou art the\nMother of the Devas; Thou art the great source of help to them; therefore dost\nThou fulfill all their desires with Thine whole heart. O Devi! We do not know\nthe limit of Thy qualities nor of Thy forms; O Goddess! Thou art worshipped by\nthe whole Universe. Thou art fully competent to save all from dangers; we are\nobjects of Thy pity; dost Thou save us from our present troubles! Thou art\ncapable to kill enemies without shooting any arrrows, without striking any\nblows, without hurling any trident, axes, S\xc2\x92aktis, clubs, or any other\nweapons; merely by Thy mere will Thou canst kill; still for sports and for the\ngood of all beings Thou incarnatest and fightest for the sake of Lila. The\nignorant persons know such things as birth, death, etc., that this world is\nnot eternal; that no actions can be without any cause; we, therefore,\nascertain by reasoning and inference that Thou art the Supreme Cause of this\nwhole Universe. Brahma is the Creator, Vi _sn_ u is the Preserver, and Mahes\xc2\x92a\nis the Destroyer; so it is related in the Pura _n_ as. Thou again hast given\nbirth to these three Gods in the respective cycles; therefore Thou art the\nMother of all; there is no doubt in this. O Devi! In days of yore, these three\nDevas worshipped Thee; Thou Wert pleased and gavest them all the best powers.\nBeing thus endowed with Thy powers, they have been able to create, preserve\nand destroy this Universe beautifully. Art they not foolish, though they be\nYatis (persons of self-controlled nature), who do not worship the Universal\nMother, the Consciousness Incarnate, the Giver of liberation, on Whose feet\nare worshipped by the Devas, and worshipping Whom, one gets the fruits of all\none\xc2\x92s desires? Certainly those Vai _sn_ avas, Sauras (worshippers of the Sun)\nand Pas\xc2\x92upatas (worshippers of S\xc2\x92iva) are foolish braggarts who do not\nmeditate Thee as the embodiment of Kamala (prosperity), modesty, beauty,\ncontinuancy, Fame, nourishment. O Mother! The Asuras, Hari, Hara and other\ngreat Devas worship Thee in this world; therefore those mortals are certainly\ndeceived by their Creator that do not worship Thee on the surface of this\nearth. O Devi! Hari himself serves the lotus feet of Lak _s_ mi by colouring\nthem (toes and other fingers of the feet) red with lac juice; Hara is very\nanxious to serve the lotus feet and take the dust thereof of Parvati; Lak _s_\nmi and Parvati are but Thy part manifestations; therefore to serve them is, in\nother words to serve Thee. What to speak of other persons, even those who can\ndiscriminate between real and unreal and those who have left their worldly\nhomes and have become dispassionate towards worldly objects, even those Munis\nworship forgiveness and mercy, that are but Thy parts; therefore who is there\n\n\n\np. 432\n\n\n\nin this world that does not serve Thy lotus-feet! O Devi! Those human beings\nplunge into the dreadful wells of this Samsara, the round of birth and death,\nand are deprived of all pleasures, who do not serve Thy lotus feet. What more\ncan be said than the fact that those fallen beings suffer terribly from\npoverty, humility, leprosy, headache, and the chronic enlargement of spleen. O\nMother! Those persons are void of any wealth and wife; they are the carriers\nof loads of wood and collect grass and leaves and show their skill in such\nacts; they are of little understanding and never they served in their previous\nbirths Thy lotus-feet. This we have come to know very well within our heart of\nhearts.\n\n\n\n43-47. Vyasa said :-- O King! When all the Devas thus eulogised, instantly the\nDevi Ambika, full of youth and beauty appeared there out of mercy. That\nextraordinary beautiful Bhagavati, endowed with all auspicious signs, and\nadorned with the Divine clothings, ornaments, and garlands and sandal paste,\netc., appeared before the Devas. Before Whom, even the world enchanter Cupid\nbows down; with such beautiful, Divine appearance, the Devi emerged from the\nmountain cave in order to take Her ablutions in the Ganges. That Devi, sweet\nvoiced like a cuckoo, gladly smiling began to say to the Devas, singing hymns\nto Her, in a voice deep like that of a rumbling cloud.\n\n\n\n48\\. The Devi said :-- O Best of Suras! Whom are you praising constantly in\nthis place? What do you want! Why are you so anxious and seem to be so much\ncare-worn? Do please tell all this to Me in detail.\n\n\n\n49\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Devas were first enchanted by Her beauty and\nsoftness; then, being encouraged by Her sweet words, began to speak with great\njoy.\n\n\n\n50-57. O Devi! We pray toThee, O Lord of his Universe! We bow down to Thee. O\nThou, the Ocean of mercy! Protect us from all the troubles; we are very much\ncare-worn and tormented by the Daityas. O Great Goddess! In ancient times Thou\ndidst kill Mahi _s_ asura, the source of troubles to all and then told us to\nremember Thee whenever any difficulty would arise. Then Thou wouldst\nundoubtedly remove all the troubles arising from the Daityas no sooner we\nremember Thee. O Devi! We have now remembered Thee for that very reason. At\npresent the two dreadful Asuras, S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha have sprang up and are\ncreating great disturbances; and they cannot be killed by any male beings. The\npowerful Raktavija and Cha _nd_ a Mu _nd_ a and other Asuras united have\ndispossessed the Devas of their Heavens. Thou alone art our goal and refuge;\nwithout Thee there is none other to save us. Therefore, O Beautiful One! Thou\ndost do this work for the Devas who are extremely troubled and distressed. O\nPowerful Devi! The Devas are always at the services of Thy lotus feet; still\nthe very powerful Danavas are throwing them into dangers; O Mother! Thou art\nthe\n\n\n\np. 433\n\n\n\nPreserver of the distressed; therefore dost Thou preserve the Devas, devoted\nto Thee. O Mother! The Danavas, being very much emboldened by their powers,\nare creating many havocs on the surface of the Earth; now remembering that, in\nthe beginning of the Yugas, Thou didst create all this Universe, Thou dost now\nought to protect all this Universe.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-second Chapter of the Fifth Book on the eulogising of the\nDevi by the Devas in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 23](bk05ch23.htm)\n\n'
