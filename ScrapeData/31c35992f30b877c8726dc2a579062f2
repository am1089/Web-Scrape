XIX.\n\nAkrura conveys Krishn\xcc\x81a and Rama near to Mathura, and leaves them: they enter\nthe town. Insolence of Kansa\'s washerman: Krishn\xcc\x81a kills him. Civility of a\nflower-seller: Krishn\xcc\x81a gives him his benediction.\n\nTHUS the Yadava Akrura, standing in the river, praised Krishn\xcc\x81a, and\nworshipped him with imaginary incense and flowers. Disregarding all other\nobjects, he fixed his whole mind upon the deity; and having continued for a\nlong time in spiritual contemplation, he at last desisted from his\nabstraction, conceiving he had effected the purposes of soul. Coming up from\nthe water of the Yamuna, he went to the car, and there he beheld Rama and\nKrishn\xcc\x81a seated as before. As his looks denoted surprise, Krishn\xcc\x81a said to\nhim, "Surely, Akrura, you have seen some marvel in the stream of the Yamuna,\nfor your eyes are staring as if with astonishment." Akrura replied, "The\nmarvel that I have seen in the stream of the Yamuna I behold before me, even\nhere, in a bodily shape; for he whom I have encountered in the water,\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, is also your wondrous self, of whose illustrious person the whole\nworld is the miraculous developement. But enough of this; let us proceed to\nMathura: I am afraid Kansa will be angry at our delay; such is the wretched\nconsequence of eating the bread of another." Thus speaking, he urged on the\nquick horses, and they arrived after sunset at Mathura. When they came in\nsight of the city, Akrura said to Krishn\xcc\x81a and Rama, "You must now journey on\nfoot, whilst I proceed alone in the car; and you must not go to the house of\nVasudeva, for the elder has been banished by Kansa on your account."\n\nAkrura having thus spoken, left them, and entered the city; whilst Rama and\nKrishn\xcc\x81a continued to walk along the royal road. Regarded with pleasure by men\nand women, they went along sportively, looking like two young elephants. As\nthey roamed about, they saw a washerman colouring clothes, and with smiling\ncountenances they went and threw down some of his fine linen. The washerman\nwas the servant of Kansa, made insolent by his master\'s favour; and he\nprovoked the two lads\n\np. 549\n\nwith loud and scurrilous abuse, until Krishn\xcc\x81a struck him down, with his head\nto the ground, and killed him. Then taking the clothes, they went their way,\nclad in yellow and blue raiment, until they came to a flower-seller\'s shop.\nThe flower-seller looked at them with astonishment, and wondered who they\ncould be, or whence they could have come. Seeing two youths so lovely, dressed\nin yellow and blue garments, he imagined them to be divinities descended upon\nearth. Being addressed by them with mouths budding like lotuses, and asked for\nsome flowers, he placed his hands upon the ground, and touched it with his\nhead, saying, "My lords have shewn me great kindness in coming to my house,\nfortunate that I am; I will pay them homage." Having thus spoken, the flower-\nseller, with a smiling aspect, gave them whatever choice flowers they\nselected, to conciliate their favour. Repeatedly prostrating himself before\nthem, he presented them with flowers, beautiful, fragrant, and fresh. Krishn\xcc\x81a\nthen, being much pleased with him, gave him this blessing; "Fortune, good\nfriend, who depends upon me, shall never forsake you: never shall you suffer\nloss of vigour, or loss of wealth: as long as time shall last your descendants\nshall not fail. Having long tasted various delights on earth, you shall\nfinally obtain, by calling me to recollection, a heavenly region, the\nconsequence of my favour. Your heart shall ever be intent on righteousness,\nand fulness of days shall be the portion of your posterity. Your descendants\nshall not be subject to natural infirmities, as long as the sun shall endure."\nHaving thus spoken, Krishn\xcc\x81a and Rama, worshipped by the flower-seller, went\nforth from his dwelling 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[549:1](vp136.htm#fr_1510) These incidents are told, with some unimportant\ndifferences, in the other accounts of Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s youth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XX](vp137.htm)\n\n'
