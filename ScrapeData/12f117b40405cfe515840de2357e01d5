For the manly host, the joyful, the wise, for the Maruts bring thou, O\nNodhas [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:1:1), a pure offering\n[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:1:2). I prepare songs, like as a handy priest\n[3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:1:3), wise in his mind, prepares the water, mighty at\nsacrifices.\n\n2\\. They are born, the tall bulls of Dyu [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:2:1)\n(heaven), the manly youths [2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:2:2) of Rudra, the divine,\nthe blameless, pure, and bright like suns; scattering raindrops, full of\nterrible designs, like giants [3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:2:3).\n\n3\\. The youthful Rudras, they who never grow old, the slayers of the demon\n[1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:3:1), have grown irresistible like mountains. They\nthrow down with their strength all beings, even the strongest, on earth and in\nheaven.\n\n4\\. They deck themselves with glittering ornaments\n[1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:4:1) for a marvellous show; on their chests they\nfastened gold (chains) for beauty [2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:4:2); the spears on\ntheir shoulders pound to pieces [3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:4:3); they were born\ntogether by themselves [4](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:4:4), the men of Dyu.\n\n5\\. They who confer power [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:5:1), the roarers\n[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:5:2), the devourers of foes, they made winds and\nlightnings by their powers. The shakers milk the heavenly udders (clouds),\nthey sprinkle the earth all round with milk (rain).\n\n6\\. The bounteous [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:6:1) Maruts pour forth\n[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:6:2) water, mighty at sacrifices, the fat milk (of the\nclouds). They seem to lead [3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:6:3) about the powerful\nhorse, the cloud, to make it rain; they milk the thundering, unceasing spring\n[4](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:6:4)\n\np. 107\n\n7\\. Mighty they are, powerful, of beautiful splendour, strong in themselves\n[1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:7:1) like mountains, (yet) swiftly gliding along;--you\nchew up forests, like wild elephants [2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:7:2), when you\nhave assumed your powers among the red flames [3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:7:3).\n\n8\\. Like lions they roar, the wise Maruts, they are handsome like gazelles\n[1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:8:1), the all-knowing. By night\n[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:8:2) with their spotted deer (rain-clouds) and with\ntheir spears (lightnings) they rouse the companions together, they whose ire\nthrough strength is like the ire of serpents.\n\n9\\. You who march in companies, the friends of man, heroes, whose ire through\nstrength is like the ire of serpents [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:9:1), salute\nheaven and earth [2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:9:2)! On the seats on your chariots,\nO Maruts, the lightning stands, visible like light\n[3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:9:3).\n\n10\\. All-knowing, surrounded with wealth, endowed with powers, singers\n[1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:10:1), men of endless prowess armed with strong rings\n[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:10:2), they, the archers, have taken the arrow in\ntheir fists.\n\n11\\. The Maruts who with the golden tires of their wheels increase the rain,\nstir up the clouds like wanderers on the road. They are brisk, indefatigable\n[1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:11:1), they move by themselves; they throw down what\nis firm, the Maruts with their brilliant spears make (everything) to reel\n[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:11:2).\n\n12\\. We invoke with prayer [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:12:1) the offspring of\nRudra, the brisk, the pure, the worshipful [2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:12:2), the\nactive. Cling [3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:12:3) for happiness-sake to the strong\ncompany of the Maruts, the chasers of the sky [4](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:12:4),\nthe powerful, the impetuous [5](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:12:5).\n\n13\\. The mortal whom ye, Maruts, protected, he indeed surpasses people in\nstrength through your protection. He carries off booty with his horses,\n\np. 108\n\ntreasures with his men; he acquires honourable [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:13:1)\nwisdom, and he prospers [2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:13:2).\n\n14\\. Give, O Maruts, to our lords strength glorious, invincible in battle,\nbrilliant, wealth-acquiring, praiseworthy, known to all men\n[1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:14:1). Let us foster our kith and kin during a hundred\nwinters.\n\n15\\. Will [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:15:1) you then, O Maruts, grant unto us\nwealth, durable, rich in men, defying all onslaughts\n[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:15:2)?--wealth a hundred and a thousand-fold, always\nincreasing?--May he who is rich in prayers [3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:15:3) (the\nhost of the Maruts) come early and soon!\n\np. 109\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to Nodhas, of the family of Gotama. No verse of this\nhymn occurs in SV., VS., AV.; but verse 6 = TS. III, 1, 11, 7.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The first line is addressed by the poet to himself.\n\nNote 2. Suv _ri_ kti is generally explained by a hymn of praise, and it cannot\nbe denied that in this place, as in most others, that meaning would be quite\nsatisfactory. Etymologically, however, suv _ri_ kti means the cleaning and\ntrimming of the grass on which, as on a small altar, the oblation is offered:\ncf. v _ri_ ktabarhis, I, 38, 1, note 2, page [84](sbe3219.htm#page_84). Hence,\nalthough the same word might be metaphorically applied to a carefully trimmed,\npure, and holy hymn of praise, yet wherever in the Veda the primary meaning is\napplicable, it seems safer to retain it: cf. III, 61, 5; VI, 11, 5.\n\nProf. Roth, in the Melanges Asiatiques, vii, p. 612, calls the derivation,\nwhich he himself discovered, a 'Columbus-Egg.' He derives suv _ri_ kti from su\n+ _ri_ kti, and translates it by excellent praise. He supports the insertion\nof v, by the analogy of su-v-ita, for su-ita. This derivation is certainly\nvery ingenious, but there are some difficulties which have still to be\naccounted for. That the substantive _ri_ kti does not occur by itself would\nnot be fatal, because other words in the Veda occur as uttarapadas only. But\nthere is the compound namov _ri_ kti in X, 131, 2, which shows that v _ri_ kti\nexisted as a substantive, though it is true that the Va _g_ asaneyins (X, 32)\nread namaukti instead. Taitt. S. I, 8, 21; Taitt. Br. II, 6, 1, 3; and Ath. V.\nXX, 125, 2, have all namov _ri_ kti. There is also the compound svav _ri_ kti\nin RV. X, 21, 1. Are these to be separated from su-v _ri_ kti, and ought we\nnot to take into consideration also the Zend hvarsta, as pointed out by M.\nDarmesteter (Ormazd,\n\np. 110\n\np. 10, note), meaning well performed, perfect in a liturgical sense?\n\nNote 3. Apas, with the accent on the last syllable, is the accusative plural\nof ap, water, and it is so explained by Saya _n_ a. He translates: 'I show\nforth these hymns of praise, like water, i. e. everywhere, as Par _g_ anya\nsends down rain at once in every place.' Benfey explains: 'I make these hymns\nsmooth like water, i. e. so that they run smooth like water.' He compares\n\xe1\xbf\xa5\xcf\x85\xce\xb8\xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, as derived from \xe1\xbf\xa5\xe1\xbd\xb3\xcf\x89. Ludwig translates: Als ein kunstfertiger das werk\nim geiste, auch geschickt mit der hand mach ich schon die in der\nopferversammlungen machtig wirkenden lieder.' I thought formerly that we ought\neither to change the accent, and read apa _h_ , or the last vowel, and read\napa\xc2\xb4 _h_. In the former case the meaning would be, 'As one wise in mind and\nclever performs his work, so do I compose these hymns.' In the second case we\nshould translate: 'Like a workman, wise in mind and handy, I put together\nthese hymns.'\n\nStill there is one point which has hitherto been overlooked by all\ntranslators, namely, that apa _h_ vidatheshu abhuva _h_ , occurring in the\nfirst and sixth verses, ought to be taken in the same sense in both passages.\nNow apa _h_ vidatheshu abhuva _h_ seems to mean water efficacious at\nsacrifices. In the sixth verse I now translate: 'The bounteous Maruts pour\ndown water, mighty or efficacious at sacrifices, the fat milk (of the\nclouds).' Hence in the first verse I should now like to translate: 'I prepare\nmy songs, like as a handy priest, wise in his mind, prepares the water mighty\nor efficacious at sacrifices.' Roth assigns to vidatha a too exclusively\npolitical meaning. Vidatha may be an assembly, a public meeting, a\nwitenagemot, or an \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xba\xce\xba\xce\xbb\xce\xb7\xcf\x83\xce\xaf\xce\xb1, but public meetings at that time had always a\nreligious character, so that vidatha must often be translated by sacrifice.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. It is difficult to say in passages like this, whether Dyu should be\ntaken as heaven or as a personified deity. When the Maruts are called Rudrasya\nmarya _h_ , the boys of\n\np. 111\n\n[paragraph continues] Rudra (VII, 56, 1), the personification is always\npreserved. Hence if the same beings are called Diva _h_ marya _h_ , this too,\nI think, should be translated the boys of Dyu (III, 54, 13; V, 59, 6), not the\nsons of heaven. The bulls of Dyu is a more primitive and more vigorous\nexpression for what we should call the fertilising winds of heaven.\n\nNote 2. Marya is a male, particularly a young male, a young man, a bridegroom\n(I, 115, 2; III, 33, 10; IV, 20, 5; V, 61, 4, with vira).\n\nThe Maruts have grown strong like well-grown manly youths. See also V, 59, 3.\n\nV, 59, 5. marya _h_ -iva su-v _r i_dha _h_ vav _ri_ dhu _h_ nara _h_.\n\nThe men have grown strong like well-grown stallions.\n\nIn some passages it has simply the meaning of man:\n\nI, 91, 13. marya _h_ -iva sve okye\xcc\x83.\n\nLike a man in his own house.\n\nNote 3. The simile, like giants, is not quite clear. Satvan means a strong\nman, but it seems intended here to convey the idea of supernatural strength.\nBenfey translates, 'like brave warriors;' Wilson, 'like evil spirits.'\nGhoravarpas is an adjective belonging to the Maruts rather than to the giants,\nand may mean of awful aspect, I, 19, 5, or of cruel mind; cf. I, 39, 1, note\n2.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Abhog-ghana _h_ , the slayers of the demon, are the slayers of the\nclouds, viz. of such clouds as do not yield rain. Abho _g_ , not nurturing,\nseems to be a name of the rainless cloud, like Namu _k_ i (na-mu _k_ , not\ndelivering rain), the name of another demon, killed by Indra; see Benfey,\nGlossar, s. v. The cloud which sends rain is called bhu _g_ man:\n\nVIII, 50, 2. giri _h_ na bhu _g_ ma\xc2\xb4 maghavat-su pinvate.\n\nLike a feeding cloud he showers his gifts on the worshippers.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The ornaments of the Maruts are best described V, 54, 11:\n\np. 112\n\namseshu va _h_ _ri_ sh _t_ aya _h_ pat-su khadaya _h_ vaksha _h_ -su rukma\xc2\xb4\n_h_.\n\nOn your shoulders are the spears, on your feet rings, on your chests gold\nornaments. See also I, 166, 10, &c.\n\nRukma as a masc. plur. is frequently used for ornaments which are worn on the\nbreast by the Maruts. The Maruts are actually called rukmavakshasa _h_ , gold-\nbreasted (II, 34, 2; V, 55, 1; 57, 5). In the \xc3\x82 _s_ val. _S_ rauta-sutra IX,\n4, rukma is mentioned as an ornament to be given to the Hot _ri_ priest; it is\nsaid to be round.\n\nNote 2. Vapushe and _s_ ubhe, as parallel expressions, occur also VI, 63, 6.\nCf. Delbruck, K. Z. xviii, 96.\n\nNote 3. Ni mim _ri_ kshur does not occur again in the Rig-veda, and Roth has\nsuggested to read ni mimikshur instead; see ni + marg. He does not, however,\ngive our passage under mya _k_ , but under mraksh, and this seems indeed\npreferable. No doubt, there is ample analogy for mimikshu _h_ , and the\nmeaning would be, their spears stick firm to their shoulders. But as the MSS.\ngive mim _ri_ kshu _h_ , and as it is possible to find a meaning for this, I\ndo not propose to alter the text. The question is only, what does mim _ri_\nkshu _h_ mean? Mraksh means to grind, to rub, and Roth proposes to render our\npassage by 'the spears rub together on our shoulders.' The objections to this\ntranslation are the preposition ni, and the active voice of the verb. I take\nmraksh in the sense of grinding, pounding, destroying, which is likewise\nappropriate to mraksha-k _r i_tvan (VIII, 61, 10), and tuvi-mraksha (VI, 18,\n2), and I translate, 'the spears on their shoulders pound to pieces.'\n\nNote 4. The idea that the Maruts owe everything, if not their birth, at least\ntheir strength (sva-tavasa _h_ , sva-bhanava _h_ , sva-s _r i_ta _h_ ), to\nthemselves is of frequent occurrence in these hymns. See verse 7, note I.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. They are themselves compared to kings (I, 85, 8), and called i _s_\nana, lords (I, 87, 4).\n\nNote 2. Dhuni is connected with root dhvan, to dun or\n\np. 113\n\nto din. Saya _n_ a explains it by bending or shaking, and Benfey, too,\ntranslates it by Erschutterer. Roth gives the right meaning.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. I translate suda\xc2\xb4nava _h_ by bounteous, or good givers, for, if we\nhave to choose between the two meanings of bounteous or endowed with liquid\ndrops or dew, the former is the more appropriate in most passages. We might,\nof course, admit two words, one meaning, possessed of good water, the other,\nbounteous; the former derived from da\xc2\xb4nu, neuter, water, or rain, the other\nfrom danu, giving. It cannot be denied, for instance, that whenever the Maruts\nare called suda\xc2\xb4nava _h_ , the meaning, possessed of good rain, would be\napplicable: I, 40, 1; 44, 14; 64, 6; 85, 10; II, 34, 8; III, 26, 5; V, 52, 5;\n53, 6; 57, 5; VIII, 20, 18; X, 78, 5; I, 15, 2; 23, 9; 39, 10. Yet, even in\nthese passages, while suda\xc2\xb4nava _h_ in the sense of possessed of good rain is\npossible throughout, that of good giver would sometimes be preferable, for\ninstance, I, 15, 2, as compared with I, 15, 3. Though suda\xc2\xb4nu, in the sense of\npossessed of good water, sounds as strange as would suv _ri_ sh _t_ i in the\nsense of possessed of good rain, or sumegha, possessed of good clouds, yet it\nis difficult to separate suda\xc2\xb4nava _h_ and giradanava _h_ , both epithets of\nthe Maruts.\n\nWhen the same word is applied to Indra, VII, 31, 2; X, 23, 6; to Vish _n_ u,\nVIII, 25, 12; to the A _s_ vins, I, 112, 11; to Mitra and Varu _n_ a, V, 62,\n9; to Indra and Varu _n_ a, IV. 41, 8, the meaning of giver of good rain might\nstill seem natural. But with Agni, VI, 2, 4; the \xc3\x82dityas, V, 67, 4; VIII, 18,\n12; 19, 34; 67, 16; the Vasus, I, 106, 1; X, 66, 12; the Vi _s_ ve, X, 65, 11,\nsuch an epithet would not be appropriate, while suda\xc2\xb4nava _h_ , in the sense\nof bounteous givers, is applicable to all. The objection that danu, giver,\ndoes not occur in the Veda, is of no force, for many words occur at the end of\ncompounds only, and we shall see passages where suda\xc2\xb4nu must be translated by\ngood giver. Nor would the accent of danu, giver, be an obstacle, considering\nthat the author of the U _n_ adi-sutras had no Vedic\n\np. 114\n\nauthority to guide him in the determination of the accent of danu. Several\nwords in nu have the accent on the first syllable. But one might go even a\nstep further, and find a more appropriate meaning for suda\xc2\xb4nu by identifying\nit with the Zend hudanu, which means, not a good giver, but a good knower,\nwise. True, this root da, to know, does not occur in the ordinary Sanskrit;\nand Hubschmann (Ein Zoroastrisches Lied, 1872, p. 48) tries to prove that the\nroot da, to know, does not exist in Zend either. But even thus we might have\nthe derivation in Sanskrit and Zend, while the root was kept alive in Greek\nonly (\xce\xb4\xce\xac\xce\xb7\xce\xbc\xce\xb9, \xce\xb4\xce\xac\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xcf\x82). This, however, is only a conjecture; what is certain is\nthis, that apart from the passages where suda\xc2\xb4nu is thus applied to various\ndeities, in the sense of bounteous or wise, it also occurs as applied to the\nsacrificer, where it can only mean giver. This is clear from the following\npassages:\n\nI, 47, 8. su-k _r i_te su-da\xc2\xb4nave.\n\nTo him who acts well and gives well.\n\nVII, 96, 4. _g_ ani-yanta _h_ nu agrava _h_ putri-yanta _h_ su-da\xc2\xb4nava _h_ ,\nsarasvantam havamahe.\n\nWe, being unmarried, and wishing for wives and wishing for sons, offering\nsacrifices, call now upon Sarasvat.\n\nVIII, 103, 7. su-da\xc2\xb4nava _h_ deva-yava _h_.\n\nOffering sacrifices, and longing for the gods. Cf. X, 172, 2; 3; VI, 16, 8.\n\nIV, 4, 7. sa _h_ it agne astu su-bhaga _h_ su-da\xc2\xb4nu _h_ ya _h_ tva nityena\nhavisha ya _h_ ukthai _h_ piprishati.\n\nO Agni, let the liberal sacrificer be happy, who wishes to please thee by\nperpetual offerings and hymns. See also VI, 16, 8; 68, 5; X, 172, 2, 3.\n\nIt must be confessed that even the meaning of da\xc2\xb4nu is by no means quite\nclear. It is clear enough where it means demon, II, 11, 18; 12, 11; IV, 30, 7;\nX, 120, 6, the seven demons. In I, 32, 9; III, 30, 8, da\xc2\xb4nu, demon, is applied\nto the mother of V _ri_ tra, the dark cloud. From this da\xc2\xb4nu we have the\nderivative danava, meaning again demon. Why the demons, conquered by Indra,\nwere called da\xc2\xb4nu, is not clear, unless they were conceived originally as dark\nclouds, like Danu, the mother of Indra. Danu might mean wise,\n\np. 115\n\nor even powerful, for this meaning also is ascribed to danu by the author of\nthe U _n_ adi-sutras. If the latter meaning is authentic, and not only deduced\nex post from the name of Danu and Danava, it might throw light on the Celtic\ndana, fortis, from which Zeuss derives the name of the Danube.\n\nSometimes da\xc2\xb4nu, as a neuter, is explained as Soma:\n\nX, 43, 7. a\xc2\xb4pa _h_ na sindhum abhi yat sam-aksharan somasa _h_ indram kulya\xc2\xb4\n_h_ -iva hradam, vardhanti vipra _h_ maha _h_ asya sadane yavam na v _ri_ sh\n_t_ i _h_ divyena da\xc2\xb4nuna.\n\nWhen the Somas run together to Indra, like water to the river, like channels\nto the lake, then the priests increase his greatness in the sanctuary, as rain\nthe corn, by the heavenly Soma-juice, or by heavenly moisture.\n\nIn the next verse _g_ iradanu is explained as the sacrificer whose Soma is\nalways alive, always ready.\n\nIn VI, 50, 13, however, da\xc2\xb4nu papri _h_ is doubtful. As an epithet to Apa\xc2\xb4m\nnapat, it may mean he who wishes for Soma, or he who grants Soma; but in\nneither case is there any tangible sense, unless Soma is taken as a name of\nthe fertilising rain or dew. Again, VIII, 25, 5, Mitra and Varu _n_ a are\ncalled s _ri_ pra-danu, which may mean possessed of flowing rain. And in the\nnext verse, sam ya\xc2\xb4 da\xc2\xb4nuni yemathu _h_ may be rendered by Mitra and Varu _n_\na, who brought together rain.\n\nThe fact that Mitra-Varu _n_ au and the A _s_ vins are called da\xc2\xb4nunaspati\ndoes not throw much more light on the subject, and the one passage where da\xc2\xb4nu\noccurs as a feminine, I, 54, 7, da\xc2\xb4nu _h_ asmai upara pinvate diva _h_ , may\nbe translated by rain pours forth for him, below the sky, but the translation\nis by no means certain.\n\nDa\xc2\xb4nu _k_ itra, applied to the dawn, the water of the clouds, and the three\nworlds (V, 59, 8; 31, 6; I, 174, 7), means most likely bright with dew or\nrain; and da\xc2\xb4numat vasu, the treasure conquered by Indra from the clouds, can\nbe translated by the treasure of rain. Taking all the evidence together, we\ncan hardly doubt that da\xc2\xb4nu existed in the sense of liquid, rain, dew, and\nalso Soma; yet it is equally certain that da\xc2\xb4nu existed in the sense of giver,\nif not of gift, and that from this, in certain passages, at all events,\n\np. 116\n\nsuda\xc2\xb4nu must be derived, as a synonym of suda\xc2\xb4van, suda\xc2\xb4man, &c.\n\nSpiegel admits two words danu in the Veda and Avesta, the one meaning enemy,\nthe other river. Darmesteter (Ormazd, p. 220) takes danu as a cloud, water, or\nriver. Ludwig translates sudanu by possessed of excellent gifts.\n\nNote 2. I thought formerly that pinvanti was here construed with two\naccusatives, in the sense of 'they fill the water (with) fat milk.'\n\nCf. VI, 63, 8. dhenum na _h_ isham pinvatam asakram.\n\nYou filled our cow (with) constant food.\n\nSimilarly duh, to milk, to extract, is construed with two accusatives: Pan. I,\n4, 51. gam dogdhi paya _h_ , he milks the cow milk.\n\nRV. IX, 107, 5. duhana _h_ u\xc2\xb4dha _h_ divyam madhu priyam.\n\nMilking the heavenly udder (and extracting from it) the precious sweet, i. e.\nthe rain.\n\nBut I now prefer to translate pinvanti apa _h_ by they pour out water, and I\ntake paya _h_ gh _ri_ tavat as a description of the water, namely, the fat\nmilk of the clouds. After that parenthesis, vidatheshu abhuva _h_ is again an\nepithet of apa _h_ , as it was in the first verse.\n\nNote 3. The leading about of the clouds is intended, like the leading about of\nhorses, to tame them, and make them obedient to the wishes of their riders,\nthe Maruts. \xc3\x81tya _h_ va _g_ i\xc2\xb4 is a strong horse, possibly a stallion; but\nthis horse is here meant to signify the clouds. Thus we read:\n\nV, 83, 6. diva _h_ na _h_ v _ri_ sh _t_ im maruta _h_ raridhvam pra pinvata v\n_r i_sh _n_ a _h_ a _s_ vasya dha\xc2\xb4ra _h_.\n\nGive us, O Maruts, the rain of heaven, pour forth the streams of the stallion\n(the cloud).\n\nIn the original the simile is quite clear, and no one required to be told that\nthe atya _h_ va _g_ i\xc2\xb4 was meant for the cloud. Va _g_ in by itself means a\nhorse, as I, 66, 2; 69, 3. va _g_ i\xc2\xb4 na prita _h_ , like a favourite horse; I,\n116, 6. paidva _h_ va _g_ i\xc2\xb4, the horse of Pedu. But being derived from va\xc2\xb4\n_g_ a, strength, va _g_ in retained always something of its etymological\nmeaning, and was therefore easily and naturally transferred to the cloud, the\ngiver of strength, the source\n\np. 117\n\nof food. Even without the na, i. e. as if, the simile would have been\nunderstood in Sanskrit, while in English it is hardly intelligible without a\ncommentary. Benfey discovers some additional idea in support of the poet's\ncomparison: 'Ich bin kein Pferdekenner,' he says, 'aber ich glaube bemerkt zu\nhaben, dass man Pferde, welche rasch gelaufen sind, zum Uriniren zu bewegen\nsucht. So lassen hier die Maruts die durch ihren Sturm rasch fortgetriebenen\nWolken Wasser herab stromen.'\n\nNote 4. \xc3\x9atsa, well, is meant again for cloud, though we should hardly be\njustified in classing it as a name of cloud, because the original meaning of\nutsa, spring, is really retained, as much as that of avata, well, in I, 85,\n10-11. The adjectives stanayantam and akshitam seem more applicable to cloud,\nyet they may be applied also to a spring. Yaska derives utsa from ut-sar, to\ngo forth; ut-sad, to go out; ut-syand, to well out; or from ud, to wet. In V,\n32, 2, the wells shut up by the seasons are identified with the udder of the\ncloud.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Svatavas means really having their own independent strength, a\nstrength not derived from the support of others. The yet which I have added in\nbrackets seems to have been in the poet's mind, though it is not expressed. In\nI, 87, 4, the Maruts are called sva-s _r i_t, going by themselves, i. e.\nmoving freely, independently, wherever they list. See I, 64, 4, note 4.\n\nNote 2. M _ri_ ga\xc2\xb4 _h_ hastina _h_ , wild animals with a hand or a trunk, must\nbe meant for elephants, although it has been doubted whether the poets of the\nVeda were acquainted with that animal. Hastin is the received name for\nelephant in the later Sanskrit, and it is hardly applicable to any other\nanimal. If they are said to eat the forests, this may be understood in the\nsense of crushing or chewing, as well as of eating.\n\nNote 3. The chief difficulty of the last sentence has been pointed out in B.\nand R.'s Dictionary, s. v. a\xc2\xb4ru _n_ i. \xc3\x82ru _n_ i does not occur again in the\nwhole of the Rig-veda. If we take it with Saya _n_ a as a various reading of\naru _n_ i\xc2\xb4, then. the\n\np. 118\n\n[paragraph continues] Aru _n_ i\xc2\xb4s could only be the ruddy cows of the dawn or\nof. Indra, with whom the Maruts, in this passage, can have no concern. Nor\nwould it be intelligible why they should be called a\xc2\xb4ru _n_ i in this one\nplace only. If, as suggested by B. and R., the original text had been yada\xc2\xb4\naru _\xc3\xb1_ i\xc2\xb4shu, it would be difficult to understand how so simple a reading\ncould have been corrupted.\n\nAnother difficulty is the verb ayugdhvam, which is not found again in the Rig-\nveda together with tavishi. Tavishi, vigour, is construed with dha, to take\nstrength, V, 32, 2. adhattha _h_ ; V, 55, 2. dadhidhve; X, 102, 8. adhatta;\nalso with vas, IV, 16, 14; with pat, X, 113, 5, &c. But it is not likely that\nto put vigour into the cows could be expressed in Sanskrit by 'you join vigour\nin the cows.' If tavishi must be taken in the sense which it seems always to\npossess, viz. vigour, it would be least objectionable to translate, 'when you\njoined vigour, i. e. when you assumed vigour, while being among the \xc3\x82ru _n_\nis.' The \xc3\x82ru _n_ is being the cows of the dawn, a\xc2\xb4ru _n_ ishu might simply\nmean in the morning. Considering, however, that the Maruts are said to eat up\nforests, a\xc2\xb4ru _n_ i in this place, is best taken in the sense of red flames,\nviz. of fire or forest-fire (davagni), so that the sense would be, 'When you,\nStorms, assume vigour among the flames, you eat up forests, like elephants.'\nBenfey: 'Wenn mit den rothen eure Kraft ihr angeschirrt. Die rothen sind die\nAntilopen, das Vehikel der Maruts, wegen der Schnelligkeit derselben.'\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. As pisa does not occur again in the Rig-veda, and as Saya _n_ a,\nwithout attempting any etymological arguments, simply gives it as a name of\ndeer, it seems best to adopt that sense till something better can be\ndiscovered. Supi _s_ , too, does not occur again. In VII, 18, 2, pi _s_ is\nexplained by gold, &c.; VII, 57, 3, the Maruts are called vi _s_ vapi _s_.\n\nNote 2. Kshapa _h_ can only be the accusative plural, used in a temporal\nsense. It is so used in the expression kshapa _h_ usra _h_ _k_ a, by night and\nby day, lit. nights and days (VII, 15, 8). In VI, 52, 15, we find kshapa _h_\nusra\xc2\xb4 _h_ in the same sense.\n\np. 119\n\n[paragraph continues] IV, 53, 7. kshapa\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ aha-bhi _h_ , by night and by\nday. I, 44, 8, the loc. plur. vyush _t_ ishu, in the mornings, is followed by\nkshapa _h_ , the acc. plur., by night, and here the genitive kshapa _h_ would\ncertainly be preferable, in the sense of at the brightening up of the night.\nThe acc. plur. occurs again in I, 116, 4, where tisra _h_ is used as an\naccusative (II, 2, 2; VIII, 41, 3). Kshapa _h_ , with the accent on the last,\nmust be taken as a genitivus temporalis, like the German Nachts (I, 79, 6). In\nVIII, 19, 31. kshapa _h_ vastushu means at the brightening up of the night, i.\ne. in the morning. Thus, in III, 50, 4, Indra is called kshapa\xc2\xb4m vasta\xc2\xb4 _g_\nanita\xc2\xb4 su\xc2\xb4ryasya, the lighter up of nights, the parent of the sun. In VIII,\n26, 3, ati kshapa _h_ , the genitive may be governed by ati. In IV, 16, 19,\nhowever, the accusative kshapa _h_ would be more natural, nor do I see how a\ngenitive could here be accounted for:\n\ndya\xc2\xb4va _h_ na dyumnai _h_ abhi santa _h_ arya _h_ kshapa _h_ madema sarada _h_\nka purvi\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nMay we rejoice many years, overcoming our enemies as the days overcome the\nnights by splendour.\n\nThe same applies to I, 70, 4, where kshapa _h_ occurs with the accent on the\nlast syllable, whereas we expect kshapa _h_ as nom. or acc. plural. Here B.\nand R. in the Sanskrit Dictionary, s. v. kshap, rightly, I believe, suppose it\nto be a nom. plur. in spite of the accent.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x81himanyu comes very near to Angra-mainyu; cf. Darmesteter, Ormazd, p.\n94.\n\nNote 2. Rodasi, a dual, though frequently followed by ubhe (I, 10, 8; 33, 9;\n54, 2), means heaven and earth, excluding the antariksha or the air between\nthe two. Hence, if this is to be included, it has to be added: I, 73, 8.\napapri-va\xc2\xb4n rodasi antariksham. Cf. V, 85, 3. We must scan r\xcc\x86o\xcc\x84da\xcc\x86si\xcc\x84. See\nKuhn, Beitrage, vol. iv, p. 193. Should rodasi stand for rodasim, as\nelsewhere? She is certainly intended by what follows in the next line.\n\nNote 3. The comparison is not quite distinct. Amati means originally impetus,\nthen power, e. g. V, 69, 1:\n\np. 120\n\nvav _ri_ dhana\xc2\xb4u amatim kshatriyasya.\n\nIncreasing the might of the warrior.\n\nBut it is most frequently used of the effulgence of the sun, (III, 38, 8; V,\n45, 2; 62, 5; VII, 38, 1; 2; 45, 3.) See also V, 56, 8, where the same\ncompanion of the Maruts is called Rodasi\xc2\xb4. The comparative particle na is used\ntwice.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. See I, 38, 14, p. 95.\n\nNote 2. In v _r i_sha-khadi the meaning of khadi is by no means clear. Saya\n_n_ a evidently guesses, and proposes two meanings, weapon or food. In several\npassages where khadi occurs, it seems to be an ornament rather than a weapon,\nyet if derived from khad, to bite, it may originally have signified some kind\nof weapon. Roth translates it by ring, and it is certain that these khadis\nwere to be seen not only on the arms and shoulders, but likewise on the feet\nof the Maruts. There is a famous weapon in India, the kakra or quoit, a ring\nwith sharp edges, which is thrown from a great distance with fatal effect.\nBollensen (Orient and Occident, vol. ii, p. 46) suggests for v _r i_shan the\nmeaning of hole in the ear, and then translates the compound as having\nearrings in the hole of the ear. But v _r i_shan does not mean the hole in the\nlap of the ear, nor has v _ri_ shabha that meaning either in the Veda or\nelsewhere. Wilson gives for v _ri_ shabha, not for v _ri_ shan, the meaning of\norifice of the ear, but this is very different from the hole in the lap of the\near. Benfey suggests that the khadis were made of the teeth of wild animals,\nand hence their name of biters. V _r i_shan conveys the meaning of strong,\nthough possibly with the implied idea of rain-producing, fertilising. See p.\n138. In RV. V, 87, 1, Osthoff translates sukhadaye by jucunde praebenti,\nBenfey by schonverzehrendem; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, IV, 70, has the right\nrendering. Cf. note to I, 166, 9.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Formerly explained as 'zum Kampfe wandelnd.' See Kuhn, Zeitschrift,\nvol. iv, p. 19.\n\np. 121\n\nNote 2. Wilson: Augmenters of rain, they drive, with golden wheels, the clouds\nasunder; as elephants (in a herd, break down the trees in their way). They are\nhonoured with sacrifices, visitants of the hall of offering, spontaneous\nassailers (of their foes), subverters of what are stable, immovable\nthemselves, and wearers of shining weapons.\n\nBenfey: Weghemmnissen gleich schleudern die Fluthmehrer mit den goldnen Felgen\ndas Gewolk empor, die nie muden Kampfer, frei schreitend-festessturzenden, die\nschweres thu'nden, lanzenstrahlenden Maruts.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. Havasa, instead of what one should expect, havasa, occurs but once\nmore in another Marut hymn, VI, 66, ii.\n\nNote 2. Vanin does not occur again as an epithet of the Maruts. It is\nexplained by Saya _n_ a as a possessive adjective derived from vana, water,\nand Benfey accordingly translates it by fluthversehn. This, however, is not\nconfirmed by any authoritative passages. Vanin, unless it means connected with\nthe forest, a tree, in which sense it occurs frequently, is only applied to\nthe worshippers or priests in the sense of venerating or adoring (cf. venero,\nvenustus, &c.)\n\nIII, 40, 7. abhi dyumna\xc2\xb4ni vanina _h_ indram sa _k_ ante akshita.\n\nThe inexhaustible treasures of the worshipper go towards Indra.\n\nVIII, 3, 5. indram vanina _h_ havamahe.\n\nWe, the worshippers, call Indra.\n\nUnless it can be proved by independent evidence that vanin means possessed of\nwater, we must restrict vanin to its two meanings, of which the only one here\napplicable, though weak, is adoring. The Maruts are frequently represented as\nsingers and priests, yet the epithets here applied to them stand much in need\nof some definite explanation, as the poet could hardly have meant to string a\nnumber of vague and ill-connected epithets together. If one might conjecture,\nsvaninam instead of vaninam would be an improvement. It is a scarce word, and\noccurs but once more\n\np. 122\n\nin the Veda, III, 26, 5, where it is used of the Maruts, in the sense of\nnoisy, turbulent.\n\nNote 3. Sa _s_ _k_ ata, which I have here translated literally by to cling, is\noften used in the sense of following or revering (colere):\n\nII, I, 13. tva\xc2\xb4m rati-sa\xc2\xb4 _k_ a _h_ adhvareshu sa _s_ _k_ ire.\n\nThe gods who are fond of offerings cling to thee, follow thee, at the\nsacrifices.\n\nThe Soma libation is said to reach the god:\n\nII, 22, I. sa _h_ enam sa _s_ _k_ at deva _h_ devam. The gods too are said to\ncling to their worshippers, i. e. to love and protect them: III, 16, 2; VII,\ni8, 25. The horses are said to follow their drivers: VI, 36, 3; VII, 90, 3,\n&c. It is used very much like the Greek \xe1\xbd\x80\xcf\x80\xce\xac\xce\xb6\xcf\x89.\n\nNote 4. Ra _g_ astu\xc2\xb4 _h_ may mean rousing the dust of the earth, a very\nappropriate epithet of the Maruts. Saya _n_ a explains it thus, and most\ntranslators have adopted his explanation. But as the epithets here are not\nsimply descriptive, but laudatory, it seems preferable, in this place, to\nretain the usual meaning of ra _g_ as, sky. When Soma is called ra _g_ astu\xc2\xb4\n_h_ , IX, 108, 7, Saya _n_ a too explains it by te _g_ asam prerakam, and IX,\n48, 4, by udakasya prerakam.\n\nNote 5. _Ri_ _g_ ishin, derived from _ri_ _g_ isha. _Ri_ _g_ isha is what\nremains of the Soma-plant after it has once been squeezed, and what is used\nagain for the third libation. Now as the Maruts are invoked at the third\nlibation, they were called _ri_ _g_ ishin, as drinking at their later libation\nthe juice made of the _ri_ _g_ isha. This, at least, is the opinion of the\nIndian commentators. But it is much more likely that the Maruts were invoked\nat the third libation, because originally they had been called _ri_ _g_ ishin\nby the Vedic poets, this _ri_ _g_ ishin being derived from _ri_ _g_ isha, and\n_ri_ _g_ isha from _ri_ _g_ , to strive, to yearn, like purisha from p _r i_,\nmanisha from man; (see U _n_ adi-sutras, p. 273.) This _ri_ _g_ is the same\nroot which we have in \xe1\xbd\x80\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xb3\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xce\xbd, to reach, \xe1\xbd\x80\xcf\x81\xce\xb3\xe1\xbd\xb5, emotion, and \xe1\xbd\x84\xcf\x81\xce\xb3\xce\xb9\xce\xb1, furious\ntransports of worshippers. Thus the Maruts from being called _ri_ _g_ ishin,\nimpetuous, came to be taken for drinkers of _ri_ _g_ isha, the fermenting and\noverflowing Soma, and were assigned accordingly to the third libation at\nsacrifices.\n\np. 123\n\n[paragraph continues] _Ri_ _g_ ishin, as an epithet, is not confined to the\nMaruts; it is given to Indra, with whom it could not have had a purely\nceremonial meaning (VIII, 76, 5).\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x82p _r i_ _k_ _kh_ ya, literally, to be asked for, to be inquired for,\nto be greeted and honoured. A word of an apparently modern character, but\noccurring again in the Rig-veda as applied to a prince, and to the vessel\ncontaining the Soma.\n\nNote 2. Pushyati might be joined with kratu and taken in a transitive sense,\nhe increases his strength. But pushyati is also used as an intransitive, and\nmeans he prospers:\n\nI, 83, 3. asa _m_ -yata _h_ vrate te ksheti pushyati.\n\nWithout let he dwells in thy service and prospers.\n\nRoth reads asa _m_ yatta _h_ , against the authority of the MSS.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. The difficulty of this verse arises from the uncertainty whether the\nepithets dhanasp _r i_tam, ukthya\xcc\x83m, and vi _s_ va _k_ arsha _n_ im belong to\n_s_ ushma, strength, or to toka, kith and kin. Roth and Benfey connect them\nwith toka. Now dhanasp _r i_t is applicable to toka, yet it never occurs\njoined with toka again, while it is used with _s_ ushma, VI, 19, 8. Ukthya\xcc\x83,\nliterally, to be praised with hymns, is not used again as an epithet of toka,\nthough it is quite appropriate to any gift of the gods. Lastly, vi _s_ va _k_\narsha _n_ i is never applied to toka, while it is an epithet used, if not\nexactly of the strength, _s_ ushma, given by the gods, yet of the fame given\nby them:\n\nX, 93, 10. dhatam vireshu vi _s_ va- _k_ arsha _n_ i _s_ rava _h_.\n\nGive to these men world-wide glory. Cf. III, 2, 15.\n\nThe next difficulty is the exact meaning of vi _s_ va- _k_ arsha _n_ i, and\nsuch cognate words as vi _s_ va-k _ri_ sh _t_ i, vi _s_ va-manusha. The only\nintelligible meaning I can suggest for these words is, known to all men;\noriginally, belonging to, reaching to all men; as we say, world-wide or\nEuropean fame, meaning by it fame extending over the whole of Europe, or over\nthe whole world. If Indra, Agni, and the Maruts are called by\n\np. 124\n\nthese names, they mean, as far as I can judge, known, worshipped by all men.\nBenfey translates allverstandig.\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. _Ri_ ti, the first element of _ri_ ti-saham, never occurs by itself in\nthe Rig-veda. It comes from the root ar, to hurt, which was mentioned before\n([p. 65](sbe3218.htm#page_65)) in connection with ar-van, hurting, arus,\nwound, and ari, enemy. Sam- _ri_ ti occurs I, 32, 6. _Ri_ ti therefore means\nhurting, and _ri_ ti-sah means one who can stand an attack. In our passage\nrayim vira-vantam _ri_ ti-saham means really wealth consisting in men who are\nable to withstand all onslaughts.\n\nThe word is used in a similar sense, VI, 14, 4:\n\nagni _h_ apsa\xc2\xb4m _ri_ ti-saham viram dadati sat-patim, yasya trasanti savasa\n_h_ sam- _k_ akshi _s_ atrava _h_ bhiya\xc2\xb4.\n\nAgni gives a strong son who is able to withstand all onslaughts, from fear of\nwhose strength the enemies tremble when they see him.\n\nIn other passages _ri_ ti-sah is applied to Indra:\n\nVIII, 45, 35. bibhaya hi tva\xc2\xb4-vata _h_ ugra\xc2\xb4t abhi-prabha\xe1\xb9\x85gina _h_ dasma\xc2\xb4t\naham _ri_ ti-saha _h_.\n\nFor I stand in fear of a powerful man like thee, of one who crushes his\nenemies, who is strong and withstands all onslaughts.\n\nVIII, 68, 1. tuvi-kurmim _ri_ ti-saham indra _s_ avish _th_ a sat-pate.\n\nThee, O most powerful Indra, of mighty strength, able to withstand all\nonslaughts.\n\nVIII, 88, 1. tam va _h_ dasmam _ri_ ti-saham--indram gi _h_ -bhi _h_ navamahe.\n\nWe call Indra the strong, the resisting, with our songs.\n\nNote 2. The last sentence finishes six of the hymns ascribed to Nodhas. It is\nmore appropriate in a hymn addressed to single deities, such as Agni or Indra,\nthan in a hymn to the Maruts. We must supply _s_ ardha, in order to get a\ncollective word in the masculine singular.\n\nNu, as usual, should be scanned n\xcc\x86u\xcc\x84.\n\nNote 3. Dhiya\xc2\xb4-vasu, as an epithet of the gods, means rich in prayers, i. e.\ninvoked by many worshippers. It does\n\np. 125\n\nnot occur frequently. Besides the hymns of Nodhas, it only occurs\nindependently in I, 3, 10 (Sarasvati), III, 3, 2, III, 28, 1 (Agni), these\nhymns being all ascribed to the family of Vi _s_ vamitra. In the last verse,\nwhich forms the burden of the hymns of Nodhas, it may have been intended to\nmean, he who is rich through the hymn just recited, or he who rejoices in the\nhymn, the god to whom it is addressed.\n\nNodhas, the poet, belongs, according to the Anukrama _n_ i, to the family of\nGotama, and in the hymns which are ascribed to him, I, 58-64, the Gotamas are\nmentioned several times:\n\nI, 60, 5. tam tva vayam patim agne rayi _n_ a\xc2\xb4m pra _s_ a _m_ sama _h_ mati-\nbhi _h_ gotamasa _h_.\n\nWe, the Gotamas, praise thee with hymns, Agni, the lord of treasures.\n\nI, 61, 16. eva, te hari-yo _g_ ana su-v _ri_ kti indra brahma _n_ i gotamasa\n_h_ akran.\n\nTruly the Gotamas made holy prayers for thee, O Indra with brilliant horses!\nSee also I, 63, 9.\n\nIn one passage Nodhas himself is called Gotama:\n\nI, 62, 13.\n\nsana-yate gotama _h_ indra navyam  \natakshat brahma hari-yo _g_ anaya,  \nsu-nitha\xc2\xb4ya na _h_ _s_ avasana nodha\xc2\xb4 _h_ --  \nprata _h_ makshu dhiya\xc2\xb4-vasu _h_ _g_ agamyat.\n\nGotama made a new song for the old (god) with brilliant horses, O Indra! May\nNodhas be a good leader to us, O powerful Indra! May he who is rich in prayers\n(Indra) come early and soon!\n\nI feel justified therefore in following the Anukrama _n_ i and taking Nodhas\nas a proper name. It occurs so again in\n\nI, 61, 14. sadya _h_ bhuvat virya\xcc\x83ya nodha\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nMay Nodhas quickly attain to power!\n\nIn I, 124, 4. nodha\xc2\xb4 _h_ -iva may mean like Nodhas, but more likely it has the\ngeneral meaning of poet.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 85.
