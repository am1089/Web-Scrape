Dharmarajan said :-- O Chaste One! Without serving the Gods, the Karma\nties can never be severed. The pure acts are the seeds of purities and the\nimpure acts lead to impure seeds. If any Brahma _n_ a goes to any unchaste\nwoman and eats her food, he will have to go ultimately to the Kalasutra hell.\nThere he lives for one hundred years when ultimately he gets a human birth\nwhen he passes his times as a diseased man and ultimately he gets purified.\nThose women who are addicted to their (one) husbands only are called\nPativratas. Those addicted to two persons are named Kula _t_ as; to three, are\ncalled Dhar _s_ i _n_ is; to four, called Pums\xc2\x92chalis; to five, six persons,\ncalled Ves\xc2\x92yas; to seven, eight, nine persons are called Pungis; and to more\nthan these, are called Mahaves\xc2\x92yas. The Mahaves\xc2\x92yas are unfit to be touched by\nall the classes. If any Brahma _n_ a goes to Kula _t_ a, Dhar _s_ i _n_ i,\nPums\xc2\x92chali, Pungi, Ves\xc2\x92ya and Mahaves\xc2\x92yas, he will have to go to the Matsyoda\nKu _nd_ a. Those who go to Kula _t_ as remain there for one hundred years;\nthose who go to Dhar _s_ i _n_ is, remain for four hundred years, those who go\nto Pums\xc2\x92chalis for six hundred years; those who go to Ves\xc2\x92yas, for eight\nhundred years; those who go to Pungis, remain for one thousand years and those\nwho go to Mahaves\xc2\x92yas remain in the Matsyoda Ku _nd_ a for ten thousand years.\nMy messengers chastise and beat and torment them very severely. And when their\nterms expire, the Kula _t_ a-goers become Tittiris (a bird), the Dhar _s_ i\n_n_ i-goers\n\n\n\np. 940\n\n\n\nbecome crows, the Pums\xc2\x92chali-mongers become cuckoos, the Ves\xc2\x92ya haunters\nbecome wolves; the Pungi-goers become for seven births boars. If any ignorant\nperson eats food during the lunar and solar eclipses, he goes to Aruntuda Ku\n_nd_ a for as many years as there are particles in that food. He then becomes\nborn diseased with Gulma (a chronic enlargement of spleen) having no ears nor\nteeth, and after passing his time so, he becomes freed of his previous sin. If\nanybody makes a promise to give his daughter to one but he gives actually to a\ndifferent person, he goes to Pams\xc2\x92u Ku _nd_ a where he eats ashes for one\nhundred years. Again if anybody sells his daughter, he sleeps on a bed of\narrows in Pams\xc2\x92uve _st_ a Ku _nd_ a for one hundred years, chastised and\nbeaten by My messengers. If any Brahma _n_ a does not worship with devotion\nthe phallic emblem of S\xc2\x92iva, he goes to the dreadful S\xc2\x92ulaprota Ku _nd_ a for\nthat heinous sin. He remains there for one hundred years; then he becomes a\nquadruped animal for seven births and again he becomes born a Devala Brahmi\n_n_ for seven births when he becomes freed. If any Brahma _n_ a defeats\nanother Brahma _n_ a in a bad useless argument and trifles him and makes him\ntremble, he goes to the Prakampana Ku _nd_ a for as many years as there are\nhairs on his body. If any woman, being very furious with anger, chastises and\nuses harsh words to her husband, she goes to Ulkamukha Ku _nd_ a for as many\nyears as there are hairs on his body. My servants put fiery meteors or torches\nin her mouth and beat on her head. At the end of the term, she becomes a human\nbeing but she has to bear the torments of widowhood for seven births. Then she\nis again born as diseased; when at last she gets herself freed. The Brahma _n_\na woman, enjoyed by a S\xc2\x92udra, goes to the terrible dark Andhakupa hell, where\nshe remains, day and night, immersed in the impure water and eats that for\nfourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life periods. Her pains are unbounded and My messengers beat\nher severely and incessantly.\n\n\n\nAt the expiry of the term in that hell, she becomes a female crow for thousand\nbirths, a female boar for one hundred births, a female fox for one hundred\nbirths, a hen for one hundred years, a female pigeon for seven births, and a\nfemale monkey for seven births. Then she becomes a Cha _nd_ ali in this\nBharata, enjoyed by all. Then she becomes an unchaste woman with the pthisis\ndisease, a washerwoman, and then an oilwoman with leprosy when she becomes\nfreed. O Fair One! The Ves\xc2\x92yas live in the Vedhana, and Jalarandhra hells; the\nPungis live in the Dan _d_ ata _d_ ana hell; the Kula _t_ as live in the\nDehachurna hells; the Svairinis live in the Dalana hells; the Dhar _s_ i _n_\nis live in S\xc2\x92o _s_ ana hells. Their pains know no bounds at all those places.\nMy messengers always beat and chastise them and they eat always the urine and\nfaeces for\n\n\n\np. 941\n\n\n\none Manvantara. Then, at the expiry of their hell period, they become worms of\nfaeces for one lakh years when they become freed. If a Brahma _n_ a goes to\nanother Brahma _n_ a\xc2\x92s wife, if a K _s_ attriya, Vais\xc2\x92ya and S\xc2\x92udra do so,\nthey go to the Ka _s_ aya hell. There they drink the hot Ka _s_ aya water for\ntwelve years when they become purified. The lotus-born Brahma has said that\nthe wives of Brahmi _n_ s, K _s_ attriyas, etc., live in hells like Brahmi _n_\ns, K _s_ attriyas, etc., and they then get freed. If a K _s_ attriya or a\nVais\xc2\x92ya goes to a Brahmi _n_ \xc2\x92s wife, he is involved in the sin of his going\nto his mother and goes and lives in the S\xc2\x92urpa hell. There the worms of the\nsize of a S\xc2\x92urpa bite that K _s_ attriya, that Vais\xc2\x92ya and that Brahma _n_ a\xc2\x92s\nwife. My messengers chastise them and they have to eat the hot urine. Thus\nthey suffer pains for fourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life periods. When they become boars\nfor seven births and goats for seven births, when at last they are freed. Now\nif anybody makes a false promise or swears falsely, taking the Tulasi leaf in\nhis hands, if anybody makes a false promise, taking the Ganges water,\nS\xc2\x92alagrama stone, or any other images of God in his hand; if anybody swears\nfalsely, placing his right palm on the palm of another; if anybody swears\nfalsely, being in a temple or touching a Brahma _n_ a or a cow; if anybody\nacts against his friends or others, if he be treacherous or if he gives a\nfalse evidence; then all these persons go to Jvala Mukha hell, and remain\nthere for fourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life periods, chastised and beaten by My messengers\nand feeling pain as if one\xc2\x92s body is being burnt by red hot coal. One who\ngives a false evidence, with the Tulasi (holy basil) in his hand becomes a Cha\n_nd_ ala for seven births; one who makes a false promise with the Ganges water\nin his hand, becomes a Mlechcha for five births; one who swears falsely while\ntouching the S\xc2\x92alagrama stone, becomes a worm of the faeces for seven births;\none who swears falsely, touching the image of the God, becomes a worm in a\nBrahmi _n_ \xc2\x92s house for seven births; one who gives a false evidence touching\nwith the right hand, becomes a serpent for seven births; then he becomes born\nas a Brahmi _n_ , void of the knowledge of the Vedas, when he becomes freed.\nOne who speaks falsely, while in a temple, is born as a Devala for seven\nbirths.\n\n\n\n45-59. If one swears falsely, touching a Brahma _n_ a, one becomes a tiger.\nThen he becomes dumb for three births, then for three births he becomes deaf,\nwithout wife, without friends, and his family becomes extinct. Then he becomes\npure. Those that rebel against their friends, become mongoose; the treacherous\npersons become rhinoceroses; the hypocrite and treacherous persons become\ntigers and those who give false evidences become frogs. So much so, that their\nseven generations\n\n\n\np. 942\n\n\n\nabove and seven generations below go to hell. If any Brahma _n_ a does not\nperform his daily duties (Nitya Karma), he is reckoned as Ja _d_ a  (an inert\nmatter). He has no faith in the Vedas. Rather he laughs at the Vedic customs.\nHe does not observe vows and fastings; he blames others who give good advices.\nSuch persons live in Dhumrandhakara hell where they eat dark smoke only. Then\nhe roams about as an aquatic animal for one hundred births successively. Then\nhe becomes born as various fishes when he is freed. If anybody jests at the\nwealth of a Deva or a Brahma _n_ a, then he with his ten\n\ngenerations above and below becomes fallen and he himself goes to the\nDhumrandhakara hell, terribly dark and filled with smoke. There his pains know\nno bounds and he lives there for four hundred years, eating smoke only. Then\nhe becomes a mouse for seven births, and he becomes various birds and worms,\nvarious trees and various animals when ultimately he gets a human birth. If a\nBrahmi _n_ earns his livelihood by being an astrologer or if he be a physician\nand lives thereby or if he sells lac, iron, or oil, etc., he goes to the Nagav\n_st_ ana Ku _nd_ a hell where he lives for as many years as there are hairs on\nhis body, tied up by snakes. Then he becomes born as various birds; ultimately\nhe gets a human birth and becomes an astrologer for seven births and a\nphysician for seven births. Then for sometime he becomes a cowherd (milkman),\nfor sometimes a blacksmith; for sometimes a painter, when he becomes freed of\nhis sin. O Chaste One! Thus I have described to you all the famous Ku _nd_ as\nor hells. Besides there are innumerable small Ku _nd_ as. The sinners go there\nand suffer the fruits of their own Karmas and travel through various wombs. O\nFair One! What more do you now want to hear ? Say.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty-Fifth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the description of the\nvarious hells for the various sinners in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 36](bk09ch36.htm)\n\n'
