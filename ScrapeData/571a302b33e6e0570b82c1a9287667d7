Janamejaya spoke to Veda Vyasa :-- O Bhagavan! Thou art the knower of all\nthe Dharmas and Thou art the chief, the crown of the Pundits, knowing all the\nS\xc2\x92astras. Now I ask Thee how is it that the twice-born have ceased to worship\nthe Highest S\xc2\x92akti, the Gayatri and they now worship the other Devatas, on the\nface of the distinct command in the S\xc2\x92rutis that the worship of the Gayatri is\nnitya, that is, daily to be done at all times, especially during the three\nSandhya times, by all those that are twice-born?\n\n\n\nIn this world some are the devotees of Vi _sn_ u, some, the followers of Ga\n_n_ apati, some are Kapalikas, some follow the doctrines prevalent in China;\nsome are the followers of Buddha or Charvaka; some of them again wear the\nbarks of trees and others roam naked. So various persons are seen having no\ntrace of faith in the Vedas.\n\n\n\nO Brahma _n_ a! What is the real cause underlying secretly here in this!\nKindly mention this to me. Again there are seen many men, well versed in\nvarious metaphysics and logic, our B.A.s and M.A.s but then, again, they have\nno faith in the Vedas. How is this? Nobody wants anything ominous to him\nconsciously. But how is it that these so-called learned men are\n\n\n\np. 1164\n\n\n\nfully aware and yet they are wonderfully void of any trace of faith in the\nVedas? Kindly mention the cause underlying this, O Thou! The foremost of the\nknowers of the Vedas.\n\n\n\nThere is, again, another question :-- Thou hadst described before the glories\nof Ma _n_ idvipa, the highest and the best place of the Devi. Now I want to\nhear how is that Dvipa greater than the great. Satisfy this servant of thine\nby describing these. If the Guru be pleased, he reveals even the greatest and\nthe highest esoteric secret to his disciple.\n\n\n\n9-10. Suta spoke :-- Hearing the words of the King Janamejaya, the Bhagavan\nVeda Vyasa began to answer the questions in due order. The hearing of this\nincreases the faith of the twice-born in the Vedas.\n\n\n\n11-30. Vyasa said :-- Well has this been asked by you, O King! in due time and\nin an appropriate moment. You are intelligent and it seems that you have got\nthe faith in the Vedas. I now answer. Listen. In ancient days, the Asuras,\nmaddened with pride, fought against the Devas for one hundred years. The war\nwas very extraordinary and remarkable. In this great war various weapons were\nused, variegated with numerous Mayas or ingenious devices. It tended to\ndestroy the whole world. By the mercy of the Highest and the Most Exalted\nS\xc2\x92akti, the Daityas were overcome by the Devas in that Great War. And they\nquitted the Heavens and the Earth and went to the nether regions, the Patala.\nThe Devas were all delighted and began to dwell on their own prowesses and\nbecame proud. They began to say :-- \xc2\x93Why shall not victory be ours. Why are\nnot our glories great? We are by far the best! Where are the Daityas? They are\ndevils, powerless. We are the causes of creation, preservation and\ndestruction. We all are glorious! Oh! What can be said before us in favour of\nthe Asuras, the devils?\xc2\x94 Thus, not knowing the Highest S\xc2\x92akti, the Devas were\ndeluded. At this moment, seeing this plight of the Devas, the World Mother\ntook pity on the Devas and, to favour them, O King! She appeared before them\nin the form of the Most Worshipful, the Great Holy Light. It was resplendent\nlike ten million Suns, and cool as well like ten million Moons. It was\nbrilliant and dazzling like ten million lightning flashes, without hands and\nfeet, and exceedingly beautiful! Never was this witnessed before! Seeing this\nExtraordinary Beautiful Lovely Light, the Devas were taken aback; they spoke\namongst themselves, thus :-- \xc2\x93What is this! What is this! Is this the work of\nthe Daityas or some other great Maya (Mayic) played by them or is it the work\nof another for creating the surprise of the Devas!\xc2\x94 O King! Then they all\nassembled together and decided to approach towards that Adorable\n\n\n\np. 1165\n\n\n\nLight and to ask It what It was. They, then, would determine its strength and\ndecide what to do afterwards. Thus, coming to this ultimate conclusion, Indra\ncalled Ag _n_ i and said :-- \xc2\x93O Ag _n_ i! You are the mouth-piece of the\nDevas. Therefore do you go first and ascertain distinctly what this Light is.\xc2\x94\nHearing thus the words of Indra, Ag _n_ i, elated by his own prowess, set out\nimmediately from the place and went to that Light. Seeing Ag _n_ i coming, the\nLight addressed him thus :-- \xc2\x93Who are you? What is your strength? State this\nbefore Me.\xc2\x94 At this Ag _n_ i replied :-- \xc2\x93I am Ag _n_ i. All the yaj\xc3\xb1as,\nordained in the Vedas are performed through me. The power of burning\neverything in this universe resides in me.\xc2\x94 Then that adorable Light took up a\nstraw of grass and said :-- \xc2\x93O Ag _n_ i! If you can burn everything in this\nuniverse, then do you burn this trifling straw.\xc2\x94 Ag _n_ i tried his best to\nburn the straw but he could not burn it. He got ashamed and fast went back to\nthe Devas. Asked by the Devas, Ag _n_ i told them everything and said :-- \xc2\x93O\nDevas! Know verily that the pride cherished by us that we are supreme, is\nentirely false.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n31-50. Indra then asked Vayu (wind) and said :-- \xc2\x93O Vayu! You are dwelling in\nthis universe, through and through; by your efforts, all are moving; therefore\nyou are the Pra _n_ a of all; it is possible that all forces are concentrated\nwithin you. Go and ascertain what is this Light? Verily I do not see any other\nperson here than you who can ascertain this great adorable Light.\xc2\x94 Hearing\nthese commendable words of Indra, Vayu felt himself elated and went at once to\nthat place where was that Light. Seeing the Vayu, the Light, the Yak _s_ a,\nthe demi-god, the Spirit asked in a gentle language :-- \xc2\x93Who are you? What\nstrength is there in you? Speak out all these to me.\xc2\x94 At this, Vayu spoke\narrogantly, \xc2\x93I am Matarisvan, I am Vayu; about my strength, I can move\nanything and I hold everything. It is through the strength of mine, that this\nuniverse is, and is alive and brisk with movements and works.\xc2\x94 That Highest\nMass of Light then replied :-- \xc2\x93O Vayu! Move this straw that lies before you,\nand if you cannot, quit your pride and go back to Indra ashamed.\xc2\x94 At this Vayu\ntried all his might but, alas! He could not move the straw a bit from that\nplace!\n\n\n\nVayu then gave up his pride and returned to the Devas and spoke to them all\nabout the Yak _s_ a (a sort of demi-god, a ghost). O Devas! Our pride is vain;\nin no way can we be able to ascertain the nature of that Light. It seems that\nthat Holy Light, adorable by all, is extraordinary. Then all the Devas spoke\nwith one voice to Indra :--\n\n\n\np. 1166\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93When You are the King of the Devas, better go yourself and ascertain the\nreality of Its Nature.\xc2\x94 Indra, then, with great pride, went himself to the\nLight; the Light, too, began to disappear gradually from the place, and\nultimately vanished from Indra\xc2\x92s sight. When Indra found that he could not\neven speak to That Light, he became greatly ashamed and began to conceive of\nhis own nothingness. He thought thus :-- \xc2\x93I won\xc2\x92t go back to the Devas. What\nshall I say to them? Never will I disclose to them my inferiority; one is\nbetter to die than do this. One\xc2\x92s self-honour is the only treasure of the\ngreat and honourable. If honour is gone, what use, then, is there in living?\xc2\x94\nO King! Then Indra, the Lord of Devas, quitted his pride and took refuge unto\nThat Great Light which exhibited, ere long, such a glorious character. At this\nmoment, a celestial voice was heard from the Heavens :-- \xc2\x93O Indra! Go on now\nand do the japam, the reciting of the Maya Vija Mantra, the basic Mantra of\nMaya. All your troubles will, then, be over.\xc2\x94 Hearing this celestial voice,\nIndra began to repeat the Maya Vija, the Seed Mantra of Maya, with rapt\nconcentration and without any food.\n\n\n\n51-61. Then on the ninth lunar day of the month of Chaitra when the Sun\nentered the meridian, suddenly there appeared in that place a Great Mass of\nLight as was seen before. Indra saw, then, within that Mass of Light, a Virgin\nForm in full youth. The lustre from Her body was like that of ten million\nRising Suns; and the colour was rosy red like a full-blown Java flower. On Her\nforehead was shining the digit of the Moon; Her breasts were full, and, though\nveiled under the cloth, they looked very beautiful. She was holding noose and\na goad in Her two hands and Her other two hands indicated signs of favour and\nfearlessness.\n\n\n\nHer body was decked with various ornaments and it looked auspicious and\nexceedingly lovely; nowhere can be seen a woman beautiful like Her. She was\nlike a Kalpa Vrik _s_ a (celestial tree yielding all desires); she was three\neyed and Her braid of hair was encircled with Malati garlands. She was praised\non Her four sides by the Four Vedas, Incarnate, in their respective Forms. The\nbrilliancy of Her teeth shed lustre on the ground as if ornamented with\nPadmaraga jewels. Her face looked smiling. Her clothing was red and Her body\nwas covered with sandalpaste. She was the Cause of all causes. Oh! She was all\nFull of Mercy. O King Janamejaya! Thus Indra saw, then, the Uma Parvati\nMahes\xc2\x92vari Bhagavati and the hairs of his body stood on ends with ecstasy. His\neyes were filled with tears of love and deep devotion and he immediately fell\nprostrate before\n\n\n\np. 1167\n\n\n\nthe feet of the Devi. Indra sang various hymns to Her and praised Her. He\nbecame very glad and asked Her, \xc2\x93O Fair One! Art Thou that Great Mass of\nLight? If this be, kindly state the cause of Thy appearance.\xc2\x94 O King! Hearing\nthis, the Bhagavati replied.\n\n\n\n62-83. This My Form is Brahma, the Cause of all causes, the Seat of Maya, the\nWitness of all, infallible and free from all defects or blemishes. What all\nthe Vedas and Upani _s_ adas try to establish, what ought to be obtained, as\ndeclared by all the rules of austerity, and for which the Brahma _n_ as\npractise Brahmacharyam, I am all that. I have told you about that Brahma, of\nthe nature of the Great Holy Light. The sages declare that That Brahma _n_ is\nrevealed by \xc2\x93O _m_ \xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93Hrim\xc2\x94, the two Vijas (mystic syllables) that are My\ntwo first and foremost Mantras wherein I remain hidden. I create this universe\nwith My two parts (in My two aspects); therefore My Vija mantra is two. \xc2\x93O _m_\n\xc2\x94 Vija is denominated as Sachchidananda (everlasting existence, intelligence\nand bliss) and \xc2\x93Hrim\xc2\x94 Vija is Maya Prakriti, the Undifferentiated\nConsciousness, made manifest. Know, then, That Maya as the Highest S\xc2\x92akti and\nknow Me as that Omnipotent Goddess at present revealed before your eyes. As\nmoonlight is not different from the Moon, so this Maya S\xc2\x92akti in the state of\nequilibrium is not different from Me. (The powerful man and the power he\nwields are not different. They are verily one and the same.) During Pralaya\n(the Great Latency period), this Maya lies latent in Me, without there being\nany difference. Again at the time of creation, this Maya appears as the\nfructification of the Karmas of the Jivas. When this Maya is potential and\nexists latent in Me, when Maya is Antarmukhi, it is called Unmanifested and\nwhen the Maya becomes Kinetic, when the Maya is Bahirmukhi, when She is in an\nactive Kinetic state, it is said to be Manifested. There is no origin or\nbeginning of this Maya. Maya is of the nature of Brahma in a state of\nequilibrium. But, during the beginning of the creation, Her form consisting of\nthe several Gu _n_ as appears, when Maya is Bahir Mukhi, She becomes Tamas, in\nHer Unmanifested state. O Indra! For this reason Her state of abstraction, and\nbecoming introspective, this is Her Antarmukhi state; it is known as Maya and\nHer looking outward is Her Bahirmukhi state; it is denominated by Tamas and\nthe other gu _n_ as. From this comes Sattva and then Rajas and Brahma, Vi _sn_\nu and Mahes\xc2\x92a are of the nature of the three gu _n_ as. Brahma has the Rajo gu\n_n_ a in Him preponderating; in Vi _sn_ u, the Sattva gu _n_ a preponderates\nand in Mahes\xc2\x92a, the Cause of all Causes, is said to reside the Tamo gu _n_ a.\nBrahma is known as of the Gross Body; Vi _sn_ u is known as of the Subtle\nBody; and Rudra is known as of the Causal Body and I am known as Turiya,\ntranscending the Gu _n_ as.\n\n\n\np. 1168\n\n\n\nThis Turiya Form of Mine is called the state of equilibrium of the Gu _n_ as.\nIt is the Inner Controller of all. Beyond this there is another state of Mine\nwhich is called the Formless Brahma (Brahma _n_ having no Forms). Know,\nverily, that my Forms are two, as they are with or without attributes (Sagu\n_n_ a or Nirgu _n_ a). That which is beyond Maya and the Mayic qualities is\ncalled Nirgu _n_ a (without Prakritic attributes) and that which is within\nMaya is called Sagu _n_ a. O Indra! After creating this universe, I enter\nwithin that as the Inner Controller of all and it is I that impel all the\nJivas always to their due efforts and actions. Know, verily, that It is I that\nengage Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Rudra, the causes of the several works of\ncreation, preservation and destruction of this universe (they are performing\ntheir functions by My Command). Through the terror from Me the wind blows;\nthrough my terror, the Sun moves in the sky; through My terror, Indra, Ag _n_\ni, and Yama do their respective duties. I am the Best and Superior to all. All\nfear Me. Through My Grace you have obtained victory in the battle. Know,\nverily, that it is I that make you all dance like inert wooden dolls as My\nmere instruments. You are merely My functions. I am the Integral Whole. I give\nsometimes victory to you and sometimes victory to the Daityas; Yea, I do\neverything as I will, keeping My independence duly and, according to the\nKarmas, justly. Oh! You all, have forgotten me though your pride and sheer\nnonsense. You have been carried deep into dire delusion by your vain egoism.\nAnd know now that to favour you, this My Adorable Light has issued suddenly.\nHence forth banish ever from your heart all your vain boastings and idle\npratings. Take refuge wholly unto Me with all your head, heart and soul, unto\nMy Sachchidananda Form and be safe. (At times the Devas forget and so fall\ninto troubles).\n\n\n\n84-93. Vyasa said :-- Thus saying, the Mula Pakriti, the Great Devi, the\nGoddess of the Universe, vanished from their sight. The Devas, on the other\nhand, began to praise Her then and there, with rapt devotion. Since that day,\nall the Devas quitted their pride and engaged themselves in worshipping the\nDevi devotedly. They worshipped the Gayatri Devi daily during the three\nSandhya times and performed various Yaj\xc3\xb1as and thus they worshipped Bhagavati\ndaily. Thus, in the Satya Yuga, everybody engaged themselves in repeating the\nMantra Gayatri and worshipped the Goddess indwelling in the Pra _n_ ava and\nHri _m_ kara. So, See now for yourself, that the worship of Vi _sn_ u or S\xc2\x92iva\nor initiation in the Vi _sn_ u Mantra or in the S\xc2\x92iva Mantra are not mentioned\nanywhere in the Vedas as to be done always and for ever. They are done for a\nwhile and not required any more when the objects are fulfilled; only the\nworship of Gayatri is always compul-\n\n\n\np. 1169\n\n\n\nsory, to be done at all times, as mentioned in the Vedas. O King! If a Brahma\n_n_ a does not worship the Gayatri, know, then, for certain, that in every\nway, he is sure to go down lower and lower. There is no doubt in this. A\nBrahmi _n_ is not to wait, no never, to do any other thing; he will have all\nhis desires fulfilled if he worships only the Devi Gayatri. Bhagavan Manu says\nthat a Brahmi _n_ , whether he does any other thing or not, can be saved if he\nworships only the Divine Mother Gayatri. (This worshipping the Gayatri is the\nhighest, greatest, and most difficult of all the works in this universe). If\nany devotee of S\xc2\x92iva or Vi _sn_ u or of any other Deity worships his desired\nDeity without repeating the Gayatri, he is sure to suffer the torments of\nhell. (But this age of Kali deludes the people and draws away their minds from\nreciting this Gayatri save a few of them.) O King! For this reason, in the\nSatya Yuga, all the Brahma _n_ as kept themselves fully engaged in worshipping\nthe Gayatri and the lotus feet of the Devi Bhagavati.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighth Chapter in the Twelfth Book on the appearance of the\nHighest S\xc2\x92akti in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 9](bk12ch09.htm)\n\n'
