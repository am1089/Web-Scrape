[1](ry370.htm#fn_849)  \nThen, dropping oil from every limb,  \nHis sons the princes followed him,  \nAnd Kumbhakarna,  [2](ry370.htm#fn_850) shaved and shorn,  \nWas southward on a camel borne.  \nThen royal Lanka reeled and fell  \nWith gate and tower and citadel,  \nThis ancient city, far-renowned:  \nAll life within her walls was drowned;  \nAnd the wild waves of ocean rolled  \nO\'er Lanka and her streets of gold.  \nWarned by these signs I bid you fly;  \nOr by the hand of Rama die,  \nWhose vengeance will not spare the life  \nOf one who vexed his faithful wife.  \nYour bitter taunts and threats forgo:  \nComfort the lady in her woe,  \nAnd humbly pray her to forgive;  \nFor so you may be spared and live,\'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXX.: Hanuman\'s Deliberation.](ry370.htm)\n\n'
