[1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n11:3:3\n\n### THIRD BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n11:3:3:11\\. The Brahman delivered the creatures over to Death, the Brahma _k_\narin (religious student) alone it did not deliver over to him. He (Death)\nsaid, 'Let me have a share in this one also.'--'Only the night on which he\nshall not bring his 2 fire-wood,' said (the Brahman). On whatever night,\ntherefore, the Brahma _k_ arin does not bring fire-wood, that\n\np. 49\n\n[paragraph continues] (night) he passes 1 cutting it off from his own life:\ntherefore the Brahma _k_ arin should bring fire-wood, lest he should pass (his\nnights) cutting off (as much) from his life.\n\n11:3:3:22\\. He who enters on a Brahma _k_ arin's life, indeed, enters on a\nlong sacrificial session: the log he puts on the fire in entering thereon is\nthe opening (offering), and that which (he puts on the fire) when he is about\nto bathe 2 is the concluding (offering); and what (logs) there are between\nthese, are just his (logs) of the sacrificial session. When a Brahma _n_ a\nenters on a Brahma _k_ arin's life--\n\n11:3:3:33\\. He enters beings in four parts: with one fourth part (he enters)\nthe fire, with another part death, with another part his religious teacher;\nand his fourth part remains in his own self.\n\n11:3:3:44\\. Now, when he brings a log for the fire, he redeems that fourth\npart of his which is in the fire; and having cleansed 3 it, he takes it to his\nown self, and it enters him.\n\n11:3:3:55\\. And when, having made himself poor, as it were, and become devoid\nof shame, he begs alms, then he redeems that part of his which is in death;\n\np. 50\n\nand, having cleansed it, he takes it to himself, and it enters him.\n\n11:3:3:66\\. And when he does the teacher's bidding, and when he does any work\nfor the teacher, he redeems that part of his which is in the teacher; and,\nhaving cleansed it, he takes it to himself, and it enters him.\n\n11:3:3:77\\. Let him not beg alms after he has bathed (at the end of his\nstudentship), for by bathing he drives off beggary, and drives off hunger from\nhis kinsmen and his deceased ancestors, 'Let him who knows this beg alms only\nfrom her in whom he has the greatest confidence 1,' they say, 'for that makes\nfor heaven.' And should he find no other woman from whom alms could be begged,\nhe may even beg from his own teacher's wife, and thereafter from his own\nmother 2. The seventh (night) should not pass by for him without begging: him\nwho knows this and practises this all the Vedas enter; for, verily, even as\nthe fire shines when kindled, so does he, after bathing, shine, who, knowing\nthis, lives a Brahma _k_ arin's life.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[48:2](sbe44020.htm#fr_184) Prof. Delbruck, Altind. Syntax, p. 260, doubtless\nrightly takes the middle form (aharatai) here to imply 'for his own self,'\ni.e. for his own protection from death.\n\n[49:1](sbe44020.htm#fr_185) Or, perhaps better,--that (night) he keeps cutting\noff from his life,--in which case the verb 'vas' would be construed with the\ngerund in much the same way as 'stha' commonly is. This construction would\nsuit even better the second passage (without the object 'tam') at the end of\nthe paragraph. In any case we have to understand that, during every night\npassed with his teacher without his having brought fire-wood, he cuts off a\nnight, or day, from (the latter end of) his life. Cf. Delbruck, Altind.\nSyntax, pp. 260, 334, 405.\n\n[49:2](sbe44020.htm#fr_186) That is, prior to his leaving the house of his\nteacher and returning to his own family.\n\n[49:3](sbe44020.htm#fr_187) Sa _m_ sk _ri_ tya = utk _ri_ sh _t_ a _m_ k _ri_\ntva, Saya _n_ a.\n\n[50:1](sbe44020.htm#fr_188) That is, from whom he is perfectly sure of getting\nsomething. Saya _n_ a, however, takes it in the sense of 'from whom he feels\nsure he will get most,'--Sa brahma _k_ ari yasya eva bhikshitaya _h_ striya\n_h_ saka _s_ ad bhuyish _th_ am bahutaram annam labhyata iti _s_ lagheta ta\n_m_ bhikshetety ahu _h_ , Say.\n\n[50:2](sbe44020.htm#fr_189) That is, after leaving his teacher's house and\nreturning home.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 4, 1.
