Mystic power of the apamarga-plant, against demons and sorcerers.\n\n1\\. On the one hand thou deprivest of kin, on the other thou now procurest\nkinfolk. Do thou, moreover, cut the offspring of him that practises spells, as\na reed that springs up in the rain!  \n2\\. By a Brahmana thou hast been blest, by Kanva, the descendant of Nrishad.\nThou goest like a stronor army; where thou hast arrived, O plant, there there\nis no fear.  \n3\\. Thou goest at the head of the plants, spreading lustre, as if with a\nlight. Thou art on the one hand the protector of the weak, on the other the\nslayer of the Rakshas.  \n4\\. When of yore, in the beginning, the gods drove out the Asuras with thee,\nthen, O plant, thou wast begotten as apamarga ('wiping out').  \n5\\. Thou cuttest to pieces (vibhindati), and hast a hundred branches;\nvibhindant ('cutting to pieces') is thy father's name. Do thou (turn) against,\nand cut to pieces (vi bhindhi) him that is hostile towards us!  \n6\\. Non-being arose from the earth, that goes to heaven, (as) a great\nexpansion. Thence, verily, that, spreading vapours, shall turn against the\nperformer (of spells)!  \n7\\. Thou didst grow backward, thou hast fruit which is turned backward. Ward\noff from me all curses, ward off very far destructive weapons!  \n8\\. Protect me with a hundredfold, guard me with a thousandfold (strength)!\nIndra, the strong, shall put strength into thee, O prince of plants!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 65.
