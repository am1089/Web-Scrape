Thee, O Agni, the gods concordantly have ever set to work as their divine\nsteward; with this intention [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:1:1) they have set thee\nto work. They have generated [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:1:2) thee, O worshipful\none [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:1:2), the immortal among the mortals, the wise,\ngod-loving god; they have generated every wise, god-loving (Agni)\n[3](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:1:3).\n\n2\\. Do thou, [O Agni [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:2:1),] turn to brother Varu _n_\na, towards the gods [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:2:2) with thy kindness\n[3](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:2:3), to (Varu _n_ a) who accepts the sacrifice, to\nthe eldest (god) who accepts the sacrifice, the righteous \xc3\x82ditya who supports\nthe (human) tribes, the king who supports the (human) tribes.\n\n3\\. O friend, turn to thy friend (Varu _n_ a), as a wheel of a chariot\n[1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:3:1) rapidly (follows) the swift (horse), for our\nsake, O wonderful one, rapidly. O Agni, find mercy (for us) with Varu _n_ a,\nwith the all-brilliant Maruts. Bless (us), O flaming one, that we may\npropagate ourselves, that we may press onward; bless us, O wonderful one!\n\n4\\. Mayst thou, O Agni, who knowest Varu _n_ a, deprecate for us the god's\nanger. Being the best sacrificer, the best carrier (of the gods), flaming,\nremove from us all hatred.\n\n5\\. As such, O Agni, be for us the lowest  [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:5:1) (god)\nwith thy help, our nearest (friend) while this dawn shines forth. Being\nliberal (towards us), cause, by sacrificing, Varu _n_ a to go away from us.\nLove mercy; readily hear our call.\n\np. 308\n\n6\\. His, the fortunate god's, appearance is excellent, and most brilliant\namong mortals. Like the bright, heated butter of the cow (the appearance) of\nthe god is lovely, like the bountifulness of a milch-cow.\n\n7\\. Three [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:7:1) are those highest, true, and lovely\nbirths of this god Agni. Being enveloped in the infinite\n[2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:7:2) he has come hither, the bright, brilliant,\nshining Aryan.\n\n8\\. He, the messenger, longs for all seats, the Hot _ri_ with the golden\nchariot, with the lovely tongue, with the red horses, of marvellous\nappearance, brilliant, always lovely like an assembly abundant in food.\n\n9\\. He, the kinsman of sacrifice, has enlightened men\n[1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:9:1). They lead him forward by a great rope\n[2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:9:2). He dwells in his (the mortal's) dwelling,\naccomplishing (his task). The god has obtained the companionship of the\nmortal.\n\n10\\. May this Agni, the knowing one, lead us to the god-given treasure which\nbelongs to him [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:10:1). That (treasure) which all the\nimmortals have created by their thought, which Dyaus, the father, the begetter\n(has created): that real (treasure) they have besprinkled\n[2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:10:2).\n\n11\\. He has been born in the dwellings as the first, at the bottom of the\ngreat (air) [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:11:1), in the womb of this air\n[2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:11:2), footless, headless, hiding both his ends,\ndrawing towards himself (his limbs?), in the nest of the bull\n[3](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:11:3).\n\n12\\. The host [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:12:1) came forth wonderfully at first,\nin the womb of _Ri_ ta, in the nest of the bull [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:12:2),\nlovely and young, of marvellous appearance, and brilliant\n[3](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:12:3). Seven friends [4](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:12:4)\nwere born for the bull.\n\n13\\. Here our human fathers have sat down [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:13:1),\n\np. 309\n\naspiring after _Ri_ ta [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:13:2). Invoking the dawns\n[3](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:13:3), they have driven out the milch-cows which dwelt\nin the rock-stable, in the prison.\n\n14\\. Having rent the rock they cleaned themselves. Others around told forth\nthat (deed) of theirs. Taking \xe2\x80\xa6 as an instrument (?)\n[1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:14:1), they sang triumphantly\n[2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:14:2). They found the light; they chanted their\nprayers.\n\n15\\. Longing for the cows in their mind, those men, the U _s_ i _g_ s\n[1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:15:1), have opened with godly words the fast-holding,\nclosed rock, which enclosed and encompassed the cows, the firm stable full of\ncows.\n\n16\\. They have devised the first name of the milch-cow; they have found the\nthree times seven highest (names or essences) of the mother\n[1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:16:1). The hosts [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:16:2),\nunderstanding this, acclaimed. The red one [3](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:16:3)\nbecame visible through the brilliant (milk?) [4](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:16:4) of\nthe cow.\n\n17\\. The confused [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:17:1) darkness disappeared; the sky\nappeared in splendour; the shine of the goddess Dawn rose up. The Sun ascended\nto the wide plains, beholding right and wrong deeds among the mortals.\n\n18\\. Then, afterwards, being awoke they looked around; then they took that\ntreasure given by Heaven, all the gods in all the houses. O Mitra, may true\n(fulfilment) belong to (our) prayer, O Varu _n_ a!\n\n19\\. I will address flaming Agni, the Hot _ri_ , the supporter of everything\n[1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:19:1), the best sacrificer. He has perforated, as it\nwere, the pure udder of the cows, (and has made flow the milk) purified like\nthe poured sap of the Soma shoots.\n\n20\\. He, the Aditi (i. e. the freedom) of all the\n\np. 310\n\nworshipful gods, the guest [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:20:1) of all men, Agni,\nchoosing (for us) the protection of all gods--may he, _G_ atavedas, be\nmerciful.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Vamadeva, the metre Trish _t_ ubh, except in verses 1-3, the\nmetres of which are Ash _t_ i, Ati _g_ agati, and Dh _ri_ ti respectively.--\nVerses 4-5 = VS. XXI, 3-4; TS. II, 5, 12, 3; IV, 2, 11, 3; TB. III, 7, 11, 3;\n12, 6; T\xc3\x82. II, 4, 4; IV, 20, 3; MS. IV, 10, 4; 14, 17. Verse 20 = VS. XXXIII,\n16; TB. II, 7, 12, 5.--The hymn has been translated and commented upon by\nBergaigne, Quarante Hymnes du Rig-veda, p. 11 seq.\n\nThis Sukta seems to be composed of two independent hymns. Grassmann believed\nthat the first three verses are the fragment of one hymn, and that verses 4-20\nform a second hymn. His reason was that verses 1-3 are composed in metres\nsimilar to Atyash _t_ i, while the rest are composed in Trish _t_ ubh. I think\nthat he was on the right way, but his opinion should be slightly modified. In\nverses 1-5 Agni is invoked to appease the anger of Varu _n_ a; while, on the\nother hand, no allusion to Varu _n_ a occurs in verses 6-20\\. I believe,\ntherefore, that the first hymn should be considered as consisting of verses\n1-5; it is composed in the metres of the Atyash _t_ i class (1-3) with two\nconcluding Trish _t_ ubh verses (4, 5). The second hymn comprises the verses\n6-20\\. The arrangers of the Sa _m_ hita, however, considered these two hymns\nas one, as is shown by the position which they have assigned to it, before the\nsecond Sukta, which has the same number of verses (20) as this first Sukta.\nComp. my Prolegomena, p. 141.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. I. e. with the intention that he should act as the steward of the\ngods. As to iti kratva, comp. I, 138, 3. iti\n\np. 311\n\nkratva bubhu _g_ rire. Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, p. 530, paraphrases iti\nkratva: mit Entschluss 'so sei es.'\n\nNote 2. Saya _n_ a, whom Ludwig follows, seems to be right in explaining ya\n_g_ ata as a vocative ('ya _g_ aniya'), and _g_ anata as 3rd plural ('a _g_\nanayan'). Bergaigne takes both forms as 2nd plural imperative: 'honorez\nl'immortel chez les mortels; engendrez le Dieu qui honore les Dieux.'\n\nNote 3. I cannot believe that Bergaigne is right in translating vi _s_ vam\na\xc2\xb4devam, 'celui qui honore tous les Dieux.' His theory is that vi _s_ vam\ndepend \xe2\x80\xa6 de a\xc2\xb4, qui logiquement gouverne le terme deva a l'accusatif.'\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The metre shows, as Benfey (Vedica und Verwandtes, p. 19, note 1) has\npointed out, that this vocative agne is a spurious addition.\n\nNote 2. Should we not read devam? 'Turn to brother Varu _n_ a with thy\nkindness, towards the god who accepts the sacrifice.'\n\nNote 3. Or 'for the sake of his kindness,' 'for winning his favour (for the\nmortals)'? Sumati\xc2\xb4 may be dative; see Lanman, p. 382; Brugmann, Grundriss der\nvergleichenden Grammatik, II, p. 602. Comp. I, 186, 10. a _k_ _kh_ a sumna\xc2\xb4ya\nvav _ri_ tiya deva\xc2\xb4n, 'may I turn to the gods for the sake of their favour.'\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. I believe that rathyeva (Padapa _th_ a rathya-iva) stands for rathyam-\niva. Comp. Lanman, p. 331; Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen\nGesellschaft, XLVIII, p. 681 seq. Prof. Max Muller refers rathya-iva to two\nhorses; he translates: 'O friend, bring hither thy friend, as two swift\nchariot-horses bring rapidly a swift wheel.'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. I. e. the nearest to men.\n\np. 312\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Literally 'thrice.' But I think that we should correct tri\xc2\xb4 ('three').\nThe same blunder seems to occur in III, 56, 5. tri\xc2\xb4 sadhastha sindhava _h_ tri\n_h_ (read tri\xc2\xb4) kavina\xc2\xb4m, 'Three are your abodes. O rivers; three (are those)\nof the sages.' Comp. also III, 56, 8; I, 116, 4.\n\nNote 2. This seems to mean, in the infinite sky.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Manusha _h_ seems to be acc. plur.; comp. VII, 86, 7. a _k_ etayat a\n_k_ ita _h_ , 'he has enlightened the unenlightened ones.' Bergaigne takes\nmanusha _h_ as a genitive depending on ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ abandhu _h_ , 'fils du\nsacrifice de Manus.'\n\nNote 2. Bergaigne compares IX, 87, 1, where it is said that they lead Soma to\nthe sacrificial grass like a horse by ropes (a _k_ _kh_ a barhi _h_ ra _s_\nana\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ nayanti). Saya _n_ a says, stutirupaya ra _g_ _g_ va, 'by a rope\nwhich has the shape of praises.'\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Comp. below, verse 18.\n\nNote 2. I. e. anointed, adorned. 'Poured down.' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Maha _h_ budhne seems to mean, maha _h_ ra _g_ asa _h_ budhne; comp.\nra _g_ asa _h_ budhnam, I, 52, 6; budhne ra _g_ asa _h_ , II, 2, 3; maha _h_\nra _g_ asa _h_ , I, 6, 10; ra _g_ asa _h_ maha _h_ , I, 168, 6; mahi\xc2\xb4 ra _g_\nasi, IX, 68, 3.\n\nNote 2. With the second Pada, compare IV, 17, 14. tva _k_ a _h_ budhne ra _g_\nasa _h_ asya yonau.\n\nNote 3. The bull seems to be Agni himself. Comp. verse 12.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. The word _s_ ardha (or _s_ ardha _h_? see note 3), which in most\npassages is applied to the host of the Maruts (see vol. xxxii, p. 67 seq.),\nseems here to refer to the company of the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras or seven _Ri_ shis, alluded\nto in the fourth\n\np. 313\n\n[paragraph continues] Pada. The seven _Ri_ shis, 'our fathers' (verse 13),\nhave, with the aid of Agni, rent the mountain and delivered the cows or dawns\n(verses 13 seqq.; IV, 2, 15 seq.). Comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 145 seq.\n\nNote 2. The bull again seems to be Agni. Comp. verse 11, note 3.\n\nNote 3. Do these epithets (comp. verse 8, Pada 3) refer to the sardha (host)?\nOr are they applied to Agni, so that we would have to translate: 'Lovely was\nthe young one (Agni), of marvellous appearance, and brilliant'? In this way\nBergaigne interprets the passage. If this translation is right, _s_ ardha _h_\nmay be considered as neuter, and the first Pada could be translated: The first\nhost came forth wonderfully.\n\nNote 4. Evidently the seven _Ri_ shis (see note 1). Bergaigne: Les sept\nprieres? ou les sept rivieres?\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. The seven _Ri_ shis sat down for chanting and sacrificing, by which\nthey have opened the mountain-prison of the cows.\n\nNote 2. The mention of _Ri_ ta in this connection is both Vedic and Avestic.\nComp. Darmesteter, Ormazd et Ahriman, p. 146; H. O., Religion des Veda, p.\n144, note 2.\n\nNote 3. The cows in this myth seem to be a mythical representation of the\ndawns. Comp. M. M., Science of Language, II, p. 584; H. O., Religion des Veda,\npp. 147, 149 seq.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. Pa _s_ vayantra (comp. _s_ lokayantra, IX, 73, 6) is quite doubtful.\nDoes there exist a stem pa _s_ va, meaning possibly, 'the herd of cattle'? And\ncan we translate, they who had their (battering-?) machines directed on the\ncow-herds'? Or, 'holding the herds with their instruments (i. e. with the\nropes used for drawing the cows out of the cavern)'?--Prof. Max Muller\nsuggests the translation, 'the cattle-drivers,' and writes, 'Does it stand for\npa _s_ u-yantrasa _h_?\n\np. 314\n\n[paragraph continues] Yantra seems the same as yoktra, or something like it,\ncf. X, 94, 7, 8. Pa _s_ uyantra would be they who hold the ropes of the\ncattle, who drive them away.' Bergaigne's translation, 'n'ayant rien (d'autre)\npour conduire le betail' (pa _s_ u-ayantra), and that of Roth ('die der Sperre\nledigen Thiere [pa _s_ va _h_ ayantrasa _h_ ] erhoben ein Freudengeschrei,'\nZeitschr. der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 678), do not carry conviction,\nnor does a conjecture like pa _s_ va\xc2\xb4 yanta\xc2\xb4ra _h_ ('the leaders of the cattle\ntogether with the cattle itself shouted triumphantly'), seem to furnish a\nsatisfying solution of the difficulty.\n\nNote 2. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 120.\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. On the U _s_ i _g_ s, compare Bergaigne's Religion Vedique, I, 57 seq.\n\n##### Verse 16.\n\nNote 1. The mother seems again to be the cow, or more exactly the Dawn\nconsidered as the mother of the cows (mata\xc2\xb4 gavam, IV, 52, 2. 3; VII, 77, 2),\nand as the mother of the _Ri_ shis (IV, 2, 15). Comp. V, 45, 2. a\xc2\xb4 urva\xc2\xb4t\ngavam mata\xc2\xb4 _g_ anati\xc2\xb4 gat. The seven names of the cow are mentioned also in\nI, 164, 3, its three times seven names, in VII, 87, 4.\n\nNote 2. Bergaigne (Quarante Hymnes, p. 14) and Pischel (Ved. Studien, II, 121\nseq.) give to the word vra the meaning 'woman' (Bergaigne: 'femme,'\nparticulierement 'femme en rut,' 'femme amoureuse'). I prefer to follow the\nopinion of Bechtel, Nachrichten der Gottinger Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften,\nphilolog.-historische Klasse, 1894, p. 393 seq. The hosts seem to be the\nassembly of the _Ri_ shis.\n\nNote 3. The dawn.\n\nNote 4. Comp. IX, 81, 1 (H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 147, note 1). dadhna\xc2\xb4\nyat im unnita _h_ ya _s_ asa gavam, 'When (the Somas) have been drawn,\ntogether with the brilliant curds of the cow.' The brilliant milk of the cow\nwhich the\n\np. 315\n\n[paragraph continues] _Ri_ shis have obtained, seems to be considered as a\nmagical means for procuring to men the aspect of the brilliant light of the\ndawn. Comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 450.\n\n##### Verse 17.\n\nNote 1. On dudhitam, comp. Geldner, Ved. Studien, II, 9, and see Rig-veda II,\n17, 4; IV, 16, 4.\n\n##### Verse 19.\n\nNote 1. Comp. vol. xxxii, p. 330 (V, 54, 10, note 1).\n\n##### Verse 20.\n\nNote 1. 'Guest' is atithi _h_ ; the play on words (aditi _h_ and atithi _h_ )\nis untranslatable.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2](sbe46091.htm)\n\n"
