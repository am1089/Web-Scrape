(The person within the eye is the highest), not any other Self; on\naccount of the non-permanency (of the other Selfs) and on account of the\nimpossibility (of the qualities of the person in the eye being ascribed to the\nother Selfs).\n\nTo the assertion made in the purvapaksha that the person in the eye is either\nthe reflected Self or the cognitional Self (the individual soul) or the Self\nof some deity the following answer is given.--No other Self such as, for\ninstance, the reflected Self can be assumed here, on account of non-\npermanency.--The reflected Self, in the first place, does not permanently\nabide in the eye. For when some person approaches the eye the reflection of\nthat person is seen in the eye, but when the person moves away the reflection\nis seen no longer. The passage 'That person within the eye' must, moreover, be\nheld, on the ground of proximity, to intimate that the person seen in a man's\nown eye is the object of (that man's) devout meditation (and not the reflected\nimage of his own person which he may see in the eye of another man). [Let,\nthen, another man approach the devout man, and let the latter meditate on the\nimage reflected in his own eye, but seen by the other man only. No, we reply,\nfor] we have no right to make the (complicated) assumption that the devout man\nis, at the time of devotion, to bring close to his eye another man in order to\nproduce a reflected image in his own eye. Scripture, moreover, (viz. _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 9, 1, 'It (the reflected Self) perishes as soon as the body perishes,')\ndeclares the non-permanency of the reflected Self.--And, further, 'on account\nof impossibility' (the person in the eye cannot be the reflected Self). For\nimmortality and the other qualities ascribed to the person in the eye are not\nto be perceived in the reflected Self.--Of the cognitional Self, in the second\nplace, which is in general connexion with the whole body and all the senses,\nit can likewise not be said that it has its permanent station in the eye only.\nThat, on the other hand, Brahman although all-pervading may, for the purpose\nof contemplation, be\n\np. 130\n\nspoken of as connected with particular places such as the heart and the like,\nwe have seen already. The cognitional Self shares (with the reflected Self)\nthe impossibility of having the qualities of immortality and so on attributed\nto it. Although the cognitional Self is in reality not different from the\nhighest Self, still there are fictitiously ascribed to it (adhyaropita) the\neffects of nescience, desire and works, viz. mortality and fear; so that\nneither immortality nor fearlessness belongs to it. The qualities of being the\nsa _m_ yadvama, &c. also cannot properly be ascribed to the cognitional Self,\nwhich is not distinguished by lordly power (ai _s_ varya).--In the third\nplace, although the Self of a deity (viz. the sun) has its station in the eye\n--according to the scriptural passage, 'He rests with his rays in him'--still\nSelfhood cannot be ascribed to the sun, on account of his externality\n(paragrupatva). Immortality, &c. also cannot be predicated of him, as\nScripture speaks of his origin and his dissolution. For the (so-called)\ndeathlessness of the gods only means their (comparatively) long existence. And\ntheir lordly power also is based on the highest Lord and does not naturally\nbelong to them; as the mantra declares, 'From terror of it (Brahman) the wind\nblows, from terror the sun rises; from terror of it Agni and Indra, yea, Death\nruns as the fifth.'--Hence the person in the eye must be viewed as the highest\nLord only. In the case of this explanation being adopted the mention (of the\nperson in the eye) as something well known and established, which is contained\nin the words 'is seen' (in the phrase 'the person that is seen in the eye'),\nhas to be taken as referring to (the mental perception founded on) the _s_\nastra which belongs to those who know; and the glorification (of devout\nmeditation) has to be understood as its purpose.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 18](sbe34055.htm)\n\n"
