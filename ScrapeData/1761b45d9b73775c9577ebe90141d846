King _G_ anaka, by\nway of punishment, said to a Brahma _n_ a who had fallen into some offence:\n'You should not live within my dominions.' Thus spoken to, the Brahma _n_ a\nthen replied to that best of kings: 'Tell me, O king! how far (extend) the\ndominions which are subject to you. I wish, O Lord! to live in the dominions\nof another king, and, O master of the earth! I wish to do your bidding\naccording to the _S_ astras.' Thus spoken to by that glorious Brahma _n_ a,\nthe king then heaved frequent and warm sighs, and said nothing in reply. While\nthat king of unbounded power was seated, engaged in meditation, a delusion\nsuddenly came upon him, as the planet 2 upon the sun. Then when the delusion\nhad gone off, the king recovered himself, and after a short while spoke these\nwords to the Brahma _n_ a.\n\n_\n\nG_ anaka said:\n\nThough this country, which is the kingdom of my father and grandfather, is\nsubject (to me), I cannot\n\np. 304\n\nfind my domain 1, searching through the (whole) earth. When I did not find it\non the earth, I looked for Mithila; when I did not find it in Mithila, I\nlooked for my own offspring. When I did not find it among them, then came the\ndelusion on me. Then on the expiration of the delusion, intelligence again\ncame to me. Now I think that there is no domain (of mine), or that everything\nis my domain. Even this self is not mine, or the whole earth is mine. And as\nmine, so (is it) that of others too, I believe, O best of the twice-born! Live\n(here, therefore) while you desire, and enjoy while you live 2.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said:\n\nTell me, what belief you have resorted to, by which, though this country,\nwhich is the kingdom of your father and grandfather, is subject to you, you\nhave got rid of (the notion that this or that is) mine. What conviction have\nyou adopted, by which verily you consider your whole domain as not (your)\ndomain, or all as your domain?\n\n_\n\nG_ anaka said:\n\nI understand (all) conditions here, in all affairs, to be terminable 3, hence\nI could not find anything that should be (called) mine 4. (Considering) whose\nthis\n\np. 305\n\nwas, (I thought of) the Vedic text about anybody's property, (hence) I could\nnot find by my intelligence anything that should be (called) mine 1. Resorting\nto this conviction, I have got rid of (the notion that this or that is) mine.\nNow hear the conviction, holding which, my domain (appears to me to be)\neverywhere 2. I do not desire for myself even smells existing in the nose 3.\nTherefore the earth 4 being conquered is a ways subject to me. I do not desire\nfor myself tastes even dwelling in the mouth. Therefore water being conquered\nis always subject to me. I do not desire for myself the colour (or) light\nappertaining to the eye. Therefore light being conquered is always subject to\nme. I do not desire for myself the (feelings of touch.) which exist in the\nskin. Therefore air being conquered is always\n\np. 306\n\nsubject to me. I do not desire for myself sounds even though existing in the\near. Therefore sounds being conquered are always subject to me. I do not\ndesire for myself the mind always within me. Therefore the mind being\nconquered is always subject to me. All these actions of mine are, verily, for\nthis purpose, (namely) for the gods, the Pit _ri_ s, the Bhutas, together with\nguests. Then the Brahma _n_ a, smiling, again said to _G_ anaka: 'Know me to\nbe Dharma, come here to-day to learn (something) about you\n[1](sbe0845.htm#fn_1459). You are the one person to turn this wheel, the nave\nof which is the Brahman [2](sbe0845.htm#fn_1460), the spoke the understanding,\nand which does not turn back [3](sbe0845.htm#fn_1461), and which is checked by\nthe quality of goodness as its circumference [4](sbe0845.htm#fn_1462).'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[303:1](sbe0844.htm#fr_1454) On getting rid of the notion that this, that, and\nthe other thing is one's own,--Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Nilaka _nth_ a agrees,\nand adds also on the subject of cutting off avarice.\n\n[303:2](sbe0844.htm#fr_1455) That is to say, Rahu.\n\n[304:1](sbe0844.htm#fr_1456) Meaning, apparently, that over which he and no\none else has power. He contracts his vision gradually, and finds nothing at\nall which he can call his own to the exclusion of others. He explains, further\non, bow he arrives at the alternative conviction stated towards the close of\nthis speech. In the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka (p. 916) he is said to have offered\nhis kingdom to Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya and himself as his slave, after learning the\nBrahma-vidya. See too Muir, Sanskrit Texts, vol. iv, p. 426 seq.\n\n[304:2](sbe0844.htm#fr_1457) See _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha) I, 13.\n\n[304:3](sbe0844.htm#fr_1458) Conditions of indigence or affluence, Nilaka\n_nth_ a. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's reading is different.\n\n[304:4](sbe0844.htm#fr_1459) There is a familiar verse, ascribed to _G_ anaka,\nwhich says, 'If p. 205 Mithila is on fire, nothing of mine is; burnt (in it).'\nThe verse occurs in the Mahabharata, _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap.\n178, st. 2, and also chap. 276, St. 4. See too Muir, Sanskrit Texts, Vol. i,\np. 429.\n\n[305:1](sbe0844.htm#fr_1460) This is not clear. I have followed. Nilaka _nth_\na's text. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's is in the earlier part more intelligible,\n'Whose is this to-day, whose to-morrow?' But I cannot find that there is any\nVedic text to this effect. Nilaka _nth_ a cites on his text \xc3\x8e _s_ opanishad,\np. 5. The meaning here seems to be, 'When I considered as to whom the things I\nsaw in my thoughts belonged to, I remembered the Vedic text that one should\nnot wish too obtain another's property, and so, thinking about the matter with\nthat caution, I could not make out that there was anything which I could call\nmy own.'\n\n[305:2](sbe0844.htm#fr_1461) This is the alternative conclusion he has come\nto.\n\n[305:3](sbe0844.htm#fr_1462) The sense of smell enjoys the smell, my self has\nnothing to do with it. Cf. Gita, [p. 55](sbe0805.htm#page_55), also Maitri,\npp. 112, 113.\n\n[305:4](sbe0844.htm#fr_1463) Whenever there is any smell, it is supposed that\nparticles of earth are there; so the meaning here is 'all things having the\nquality of smell are subject to me,' and so throughout. The objects of sense\nare all used for the purposes of the prescribed actions, the benefits of which\naccrue to gods, &c. Cf. Gita, pp. [53](sbe0805.htm#page_53),\n[54](sbe0805.htm#page_54), and see also pp. [84](sbe0811.htm#page_84),\n[85](sbe0811.htm#page_85).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVIII](sbe0845.htm)\n\n"
