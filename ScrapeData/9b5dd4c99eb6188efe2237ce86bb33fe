VIII.\n\nThe demon Dhenuka destroyed by Rama.\n\nAGAIN, tending upon the herds, Ke\xc5\x9bava and Rama wandered through the woods, and\non one occasion came to a pleasing grove of palms, where dwelt the fierce\ndemon Dhenuka, feeding upon the flesh of deer. Beholding the trees covered\nwith fruit, and desirous of gathering it, the cowherds called out to the\nbrothers, and said, "See, Rama; see, Krishn\xcc\x81a; in this grove, belonging to the\ngreat Dhenuka, the trees are loaded with ripe fruit, the smell of which\nperfumes the air: we should like to eat some. Will you throw some down?" As\nsoon as the boys had spoken, Sankarshan\xcc\x81a and Krishn\xcc\x81a shook the trees, and\nbrought down the fruit on the ground. Hearing the noise of the falling fruit,\nthe fierce and malignant demon Dhenuka, in the form of an ass, hastened to the\nspot in a great passion, and began to kick Rama on the breast with his hinder\nheels. Rama, however, seized him by both hind legs, and whirling him round\nuntil he expired, tossed his carcass to the top of a palm tree, from the\nbranches of which it struck down abundance of fruit, like rain drops poured\nupon earth by the wind. The animals that were of kin to Dhenuka came running\nto his aid; but Krishn\xcc\x81a and Rama treated them in the same manner, until the\ntrees were laden with dead asses, and the ground was strewed with ripe fruit.\nHenceforward the cattle grazed unobstructed in the palm grove, and cropped the\nnew pasturage, where they had never before ventured 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[517:1](vp125.htm#fr_1481) This exploit is related in the Bhagavata, Hari\nVan\xc5\x9ba, and other Vaishn\xcc\x81ava Puran\xcc\x81as, much in the same strain, but not always\nin the same place: it more commonly precedes the legend of the discomfiture of\nKaliya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IX](vp126.htm)\n\n'
