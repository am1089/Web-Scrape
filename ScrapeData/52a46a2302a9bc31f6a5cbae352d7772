If it be objected that (Brahman is) not (denoted) on account of the metre\nbeing denoted; (we reply) not so, because thus the direction of the mind (on\nBrahman) is declared; for thus it is seen.\n\nThe previous section at first refers to the metre called Gayatri, 'The Gayatri\nindeed is everything' (III, 12, 1), and then introduces--with the words 'this\nis also declared by a _Rik_ verse'--the verse, 'Such is the greatness of it\n(viz. the Gayatri),' &c. Now, as this verse also refers to the metre, there is\nnot any reference to the highest Person.--To this objection the second part of\nthe Sutra replies. The word 'Gayatri' does not here denote the metre only,\nsince this cannot possibly be the Self of all; but the text declares the\napplication of the idea of Gayatri to Brahman, i.e. teaches, to the end of a\ncertain result being obtained, meditation on Brahman in so far as similar to\nGayatri. For Brahman having four feet, in the sense indicated by the _rik_ ,\nmay be compared to the Gayatri with its four (metrical) feet. The Gayatri\n(indeed has as a rule three feet, but) occasionally a Gayatri with four feet\nis met with; so, e.g., 'Indra _s_ _s_ a _k_ ipati _h_ | valena pi _d_ ita _h_\n| du _sk_ yavano v _ri_ sha | samitsu sasahi _h_.' We see that in other\npassages also words primarily denoting metres are employed in other senses;\nthus, e.g., in the sa _m_ vargavidya ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 3, 8), where Vira _g_\n(the name of a metre of ten syllables) denotes a group of ten divine beings.\n\np. 249\n\nFor this conclusion the next Sutra supplies a further argument.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 27.
