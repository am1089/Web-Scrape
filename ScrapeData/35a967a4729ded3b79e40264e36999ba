You are honourable, and wealthy, you have\nlearnt the Vedas and been told the Upanishads. Whither then will you go when\ndeparting hence?'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: 'Sir, I do not know whither I shall go.'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: 'Then I shall tell you this, whither you will go.'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: 'Tell it, Sir.'\n\n2\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: 'That person who is in the right eye 2, he is\ncalled Indha, and him who is Indha they call indeed 3 Indra mysteriously, for\nthe gods love what is mysterious, and dislike what is evident.\n\n3\\. 'Now that which in the shape of a person is in the right eye, is his wife,\nVira _g_  4. Their meeting-place 5 is the ether within the heart, and their\nfood the red lump within the heart. Again, their covering 6 is that which is\nlike net-work within the heart, and the road on which they move (from sleep to\nwaking) is the artery that rises upwards from the heart. Like a hair divided\ninto a thousand parts, so are the veins of it, which are called Hita 7, placed\n\np. 160\n\nfirmly within the heart. Through these indeed that (food) flows on flowing,\nand he (the Tai _g_ asa) receives as it were purer food 1 than the corporeal\nSelf (the Vai _s_ vanara).\n\n4\\. 'His (the Tai _g_ asa's) Eastern quarter are the pra _n_ as (breath) which\ngo to the East;\n\n'His Southern quarter are the pra _n_ as which go to the South;\n\n'His Western quarter are the pra _n_ as which go to the West;\n\n'His Northern quarter are the pra _n_ as which go to the North;\n\n'His Upper (Zenith) quarter are the pra _n_ as which go upward;\n\n'His Lower (Nadir) quarter are the pra _n_ as which go downward;\n\n'All the quarters are all the pra _n_ as. And he (the \xc3\x82tman in that state) can\nonly be described by No 2, no! He is incomprehensible, for he cannot be\ncomprehended; he is undecaying, for he cannot decay; he is not attached, for\nhe does not attach himself; he is unbound, he does not suffer, he does not\nperish. O _G_ anaka, you have indeed reached fearlessness,'--thus said Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\n\nThen _G_ anaka said: 'May that fearlessness come to you also who teachest us\nfearlessness. I bow to you. Here are the Videhas, and here am I (thy slave).'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[159:1](sbe15074.htm#fr_467) This refers to the preceding doctrines which had\nbeen communicated to _G_ anaka by other teachers, and particularly to the\nupasanas of Brahman as knowledge, dear, true, endless, bliss, and certainty.\n\n[159:2](sbe15074.htm#fr_468) See also Maitr. Up. VII, p. 216.\n\n[159:3](sbe15074.htm#fr_469) The Madhyandinas read parokshe _n_ eva, but the\ncommentator explains iva by eva. See also Ait. Up. I, 3, 14.\n\n[159:4](sbe15074.htm#fr_470) Indra is called by the commentator Vai _s_\nvanara, and his wife Vira _g_. This couple, in a waking state, is Vi _s_ va;\nin sleep, Tai _g_ asa.\n\n[159:5](sbe15074.htm#fr_471) Sa _m_ stava, lit. the place where they sing\npraises together, that is, where they meet.\n\n[159:6](sbe15074.htm#fr_472) Pravara _n_ a may also mean hiding-place,\nretreat.\n\n[159:7](sbe15074.htm#fr_473) Hita, a name frequently given to these na _d_ is;\nsee IV, 3, 20; _Kh_ and. Up. VI, 5, 3, comm.; Kaush. Up. IV, 20. See also Ka\n_th_ a Up. VI, 16.\n\n[160:1](sbe15074.htm#fr_474) Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga explains that food, when it is\neaten, is first of all changed into the coarse food, which goes away downward,\nand into the subtler food. This subtler food is again divided into the middle\njuice that feeds the body, and the finest, which is called the red lump.\n\n[160:2](sbe15074.htm#fr_475) See B _ri_ h. Up. II, 3, 6; IV, 9, 26.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3](sbe15075.htm)\n\n"
