Now, therefore, the penances (will be described).\n\n2\\. The murderer of a learned Brahma _n_ a (shall practise the following vow)\nduring twelve years: 2\n\n3\\. Carrying a skull (instead of a dish) and the foot of a bedstead (instead\nof a staff), dressed in the hide of an ass, staying in the forest, making a\ndead man\'s skull his flag, he shall cause a hut to be built in a burial-ground\nand reside there; going to seven houses in order to beg food, while\nproclaiming his deed, he shall support life with what (he gets there), and\nshall fast if he obtains nothing;\n\n4\\. Or he may offer a horse-sacrifice, a Gosava, or an Agnish _t_ ut 4\n\np. 212\n\n5\\. Or he may bathe (with the priests) on the completion of a horse-sacrifice\n(offered by somebody else). 5\n\n6\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): \'He who unintentionally slays\na Brahma _n_ a becomes sinful according to the sacred law. The sages declare\nthat he may be purified (if he did it) unintentionally. But no expiation is\nfound for a wilful murderer.\' 6\n\n7\\. He who has raised his hand (against a Brahma _n_ a), shall perform a K\n_ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance, an Atik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance if he strikes, a K\n_ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra and a _K_ andraya _n_ a if blood flows. Therefore let him\nneither raise his hand nor cause blood to flow.\' 7\n\n8\\. (For killing) a Kshatriya (he shall keep the normal vow of continence)\nduring nine years, 8\n\n9\\. (For killing) a Vai _s_ ya during three (years),\n\n10\\. (For killing) a _S_ udra during one year,\n\n11\\. Likewise for killing a woman. 11\n\n12\\. (The penance for killing) a woman who has bathed after temporary\nuncleanness (is) the same (as that) for (the murder of) a Brahma _n_ a. 12\n\np. 213\n\n13\\. He who has defiled the bed of a Guru shall place himself on a heated iron\nbed, 13\n\n14\\. Or embrace a red hot image (of a woman),\n\n15\\. Or cutting off his organ together with the testicles and holding them in\nhis joined hands, he shall walk towards the south-west until he falls down\n(dead).\n\n16\\. A thief shall go to the king with flying hair, carrying on his shoulder a\nclub of Sindhraka wood (and say), \'Strike me with that.\' (Then the king) shall\nstrike him. 16\n\n17\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): \'A thief shall go to the king\ncarrying a club on his shoulder (and say to him), \'Punish me with that, O\nking, remembering the duty of Kshatriyas.\' 17\n\n\'Whether he be punished or be pardoned, the thief is freed from his guilt. But\nif the king does not punish him, that guilt of the thief falls on him.\'\n\n18\\. If he has drunk (the spirituous liquor called) Sura, he shall scald\nhimself to death with hot (liquor of the) same (kind). 18\n\n19\\. For unintentionally drinking (Sura), he shall perform K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra\npenances during three months and be initiated again, 19\n\n20\\. And (on this second initiation) the cutting (of 20\n\np. 214\n\nthe hair and nails), the vows, and (the observance of the) restrictive rules\nmay be omitted.\n\n21\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): \'A Brahma _n_ a, Kshatriya,\nor Vai _s_ ya who has unintentionally drunk (the spirituous liquor called)\nVaru _n_ i or has swallowed urine or faeces must be initiated a second time.\'\n21\n\n22\\. \'But he who drinks water which has stood in a vessel, used for keeping\nSura, shall live six days on milk in which (leaves of) the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khapushpi\nplant have been boiled.\' 22\n\n23\\. If (a pupil) who is employed by his teacher (on some errand) meets with\nhis death, (the teacher) shall perform three K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penances. 23\n\n24\\. The same (penance) is prescribed for not finishing (the education of the\npupil). 24\n\n25\\. If a student assists at the burial of anybody except (at that of his)\nmother, of his father, or of his teacher, he must begin his vow afresh. 25\n\n26\\. If a (student) is sick, he may, at his pleasure, eat all the fragments of\nhis teacher\'s meal as medicine. 26\n\n27\\. He may physic himself with any (medicine) which he may desire. 27\n\np. 215\n\n28\\. When he is unable to move, he may worship the sun, after he has risen,\nreciting this ( _Ri_ k verse): A swan, dwelling in purity.\' 28\n\n29\\. When he has spent his manly strength in the day-time, let him thrice\ndrink water that reaches his heart, reciting the verses which contain the word\nretas. 29\n\n30\\. A student who approaches a woman (is called) an Avakir _n_ in, 30\n\n31\\. Let him offer an ass (in the place of) a sacrificial animal.\n\n32\\. The sacrificial meat-cake (puro _d_ asa shall be offered) to Nir _ri_ ti,\nor to the Rakshasas, or to Yama.\n\n33\\. It is declared in the Veda, \'The piece to be eaten by the sacrificer (pra\n_s_ itra, shall be taken) from the organ (of the animal); and the (other)\nportions shall be offered in water.\' 33\n\n34\\. \'Or he may also heap (fuel) on the fire in the night of the new moon,\nperform the preparatory rites required for the Darvihoma, and offer two 34\n\np. 216\n\noblations of clarified butter (reciting these two sacred texts): "O Lust, I\nhave broken my vow; my vow have I broken, O Lust; to Lust Svaha;" "O Lust, I\nhave done evil; evil have I done, O Lust; to Lust Svaha."\'\n\n35\\. \'After he has made the offering, he shall address the fire, closely\njoining his hands, turning sideways (with the following texts): "May the\nMaruts grant me, may Indra, may B _ri_ haspati, may this fire grant me long\nlife and strength, may it make me long-lived! "\'\n\n36\\. Now the relatives shall empty (the water-pot) of a (grievous offender) at\na (solemn) meeting (and he shall confess), \'I N. N. am (the perpetrator of)\nsuch and such (a deed).\' After (the outcast) has performed (his penance) the\nBrahma _n_ as shall ask him who has touched water, milk, clarified butter,\nhoney, and salt, \'Hast thou performed (thy penance)?\' The other (person) shall\nanswer, \'Om\' (yes)! They shall admit him who has performed (a penance) to all\nsacrificial rites, making no difference (between him and others). 36\n\n37\\. If he unintentionally marries a female who belongs to his own family\n(gotra), he shall support her, (treating her) like his mother. 37\n\np. 217\n\n38\\. If (such a woman) has borne a child; he shall perform K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra\npenances during three months and offer (two burnt oblations reciting) the two\n(Mantras), \'That which is the blemish of my soul\' (and) \'Fire restored my\nsight.\' 38\n\n39\\. \'An elder brother whose younger brother marries first, the younger\nbrother who marries first, the damsel wedded (by the latter), he who gives her\naway, and fifthly, he who sacrifices for them (at the wedding), all sink to a\nregion of torment.\' 39\n\n40\\. The unmarried elder brother and the married younger brother, the giver\n(of the maiden) and the performer of the sacrifices become pure by undergoing\na K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance of twelve days, the female (who has been wedded\nto the younger brother) by (fasting during) three days.\' 40\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[211:2](sbe1455.htm#fr_1046)-3. **1**. Gautama XXII, 4-6; Vish _n_ u L, I-3,\n15. The expression \'staying in the forest\' means that the sinner shall not\nstop in the village or the fields during the day-time, but live in some\nuncultivated tract in the neighbourhood.\n\n[211:4](sbe1455.htm#fr_1047) Gautama XIX, 9-10.

Regarding the\npenances named, see Vasish _th_ a XXI, 20, XXIV, 1-2, XXIII, 45, and below,\nII, 1, 2, 38, IV, 5, 6.\n\n[212:8](sbe1455.htm#fr_1051)-10. Vasish _th_ a XX, 31-33. The words \'shall\nkeep the normal vow of continence\' have been inserted in accordance with\nGovinda\'s explanation, which apparently is based on Gautama XXII, 14. But it\nis also possible that Baudhayana, like Vish _n_ u (L, 15) and others, may have\nintended murderers of Kshatriyas, Vai _s_ yas, &c., too, to perform the\npenance prescribed above, Sutra 4, only for shorter periods.\n\n[212:11](sbe1455.htm#fr_1052) Gautama XXII, 17. Govinda is of opinion that the\nword ka, \'likewise,\' is intended to include \'worthless\' Kshatriyas and Vai _s_\nyas.\n\n[212:12](sbe1455.htm#fr_1053) Vasish _th_ a XX, 34-35.\n\n[213:13](sbe1455.htm#fr_1054)-15.

For that (omission) the same (penance), i.e. three K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ras\n(are to be) performed.\'--Govinda.\n\n[214:25](sbe1455.htm#fr_1064) Vasish _th_ a XXIII; 7-8. \'Assists at a burial (\n_s_ avakarma), i.e. lays out a corpse, and so forth (ala _m_ kara _n_ adi), or\ncarries it out, and so forth.\'--Govinda.\n\n[214:26](sbe1455.htm#fr_1065) Vasish _th_ a XXIII, 9, and note.\n\n[214:27](sbe1455.htm#fr_1066) \'The meaning is that he may cure himself even\nwith such p. 215 (substances) which are forbidden even to his teacher, e.g.\ngarlic, and so forth.\' For a Sm _ri_ ti declares,\' He shall protect himself by\nevery means.\'--Govinda.\n\n[215:28](sbe1455.htm#fr_1067) \'Unable to move,\' i.e. sick. This is a penance\nto be performed by a sick. student when he is unable to fulfil the rules\nenjoining the morning and evening prayers, and the like; and it applies to\nother men also because there is no objection. Regarding the Mantra, see\nTaittiriya Sa _m_ hita I, 8, 15, 2.\n\n[215:29](sbe1455.htm#fr_1068) The rule refers to intercourse with a wife in\nthe day-time; see Vish _n_ u LIII, 4. The Retasyas occur Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka I, 30.\n\n[215:30](sbe1455.htm#fr_1069) Vasish _th_ a XXIII, 1.\n\n[215:33](sbe1455.htm#fr_1070) Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 102; Katyayana _S_ rauta\nSutra I, 1, 15.\n\n[215:34](sbe1455.htm#fr_1071) Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka II, r 8. The \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka\nhas, more appropriately, pra _n_ iya, \'having taken out,\' before upasamadhaya,\n\'may heap (fuel) upon.\' The Dekhan and Gu _g_ arat MSS. insert the words \'am\n_ri_ ta _m_ p. 216 va a _g_ yam am _ri_ tam evatman dhatte,\' which occur also\nin the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, after the Mantra. According to Govinda pari _k_ esh _t_\na, \'preparatory rites,\' refers to the consecration of the clarified butter,\nand so forth, The special rules regarding the Darvihomas are given Katyayana\n_S_ rauta Sutra VI, 10, 17 seq.\n\n[216:36](sbe1455.htm#fr_1072) Vasish _th_ a XV, 12-21. Govinda thinks that\nnirvi _s_ esha _m_ savaniya _m_ kuryu _h_ , \'they shall admit him to all\nsacrificial rites, making no difference,\' may also be interpreted by \'they\nshall perform for him the sacraments just as for a new-born child.\'\n\n[216:37](sbe1455.htm#fr_1073) Colebrooke V, Dig. CCCXL.\n\n[217:38](sbe1455.htm#fr_1074) The Mantras are found, Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita\nIII, 2, 5, 4.\n\n[217:39](sbe1455.htm#fr_1075) Vasish _th_ a XX, 7-8. The MSS. read parivitti\n_h_ parivetta ya _s_ _k_ aina _m_ [na _m_ ] parivindati. But it is absolutely\nnecessary to adopt either the various reading given Manu III, 172, yaya _k_ a\nparividyate, or to read ya _k_ aina _m_ parivindati.\n\n[217:40](sbe1455.htm#fr_1076) The MSS. all read at the end of the verse,\ntristriratre _n_ a or dvistriratre _n_ a. The correct reading appears,\nhowever, to be stri triratre _n_ a; for Govinda says, yaya saha parivetta\nbhutas [bhuttasya C. L, bhutassastri C. T.] tasyas triratre _n_ opavasena _s_\nuddhi _h_ , \'the purification of that female with whom he has become a\nparivett _ri_ takes place through three days, i.e. through fasting (three\ndays).\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Adhyaya 1, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 2](sbe1456.htm)\n\n'
