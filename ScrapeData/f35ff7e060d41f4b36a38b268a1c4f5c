XXVI.\n\nKrishn\xcc\x81a carries off Rukmini: the princes who come to rescue her repulsed by\nBalarama. Rukmin overthrown, but spared by Krishn\xcc\x81a, founds Bhojakat\xcc\x81a.\nPradyumna born of Rukmini.\n\nBH\xc3\x8dSHMAKA was king of Vidarbha, residing at Kundina 1. He had a son named\nRukmin, and a beautiful daughter termed Rukmini. Krishn\xcc\x81a fell in love with\nthe latter, and solicited her in marriage; but her brother who hated Krishn\xcc\x81a,\nwould not assent to the espousals. At the suggestion of Jarasandha, and with\nthe concurrence of his son, the powerful sovereign Bhishmaka affianced Rukmini\nto \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala. In order to celebrate the nuptials, Jarasandha and other princes,\nthe friends of \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala, assembled in the capital of Vidarbha; and Krishn\xcc\x81a,\nattended by Balabhadra and many other Yadavas, also went to Kundina to witness\nthe wedding. When there, Hari contrived, on the eve of the nuptials, to carry\noff the princess 2, leaving Rama and his kinsmen to sustain the weight of his\nenemies. Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka, the illustrious Dantavakra, Viduratha, \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala,\nJarasandha, \xc5\x9aalya, and other kings, indignant at the insult, exerted\nthemselves to kill Krishn\xcc\x81a, but were repelled by Balarama and the Yadavas.\nRukmin, vowing that he would never enter Kundina again until he had slain\nKe\xc5\x9bava in fight, pursued and overtook him. In the combat that ensued, Krishn\xcc\x81a\ndestroyed with his discus, as if in sport, the host of Rukmin, with all its\nhorse, and elephants, and foot, and chariots, and overthrew him, and hurled\nhim on the ground, and would have put him to death, but was withheld by the\nentreaties of Rukmini. "He is my only brother," she exclaimed, "and must not\nbe slain by\n\np. 574\n\nthee: restrain your wrath, O divine lord, and give me my brother in charity."\nThus addressed by her, Krishn\xcc\x81a, whom no acts affect, spared Rukmin 3; and he\n(in pursuance of his vow) founded the city Bhojakat\xcc\x81a 4, and ever afterwards\ndwelt therein. After the defeat of Rukmin, Krishn\xcc\x81a married Rukmini in due\nform, having first made her his own by the Rakshasa ritual 5. She bore him the\ngallant Pradyumna, a portion of the deity of love. The demon Sambara carried\nhim off, but he slew the demon.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[573:1](vp143.htm#fr_1534) Vidarbha is the country of Berar, and the name\nremains in the present city of Beder: the capital however, Kundinapur, is\ncommonly identified with a place called Kundapur, about forty miles north-east\nof Amaravati (in Berar).\n\n[573:2](vp143.htm#fr_1535) When she had gone forth from the city to worship\nAmbika: Bhagavata.
