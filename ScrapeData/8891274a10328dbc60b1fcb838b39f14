Now this--to wit, the sacrifice--is the self of all beings, and of\nall gods: after its successful consummation the Sacrificer prospers in\noffspring (or, people) and cattle; but he whose Gharma (pot) is shattered is\ndeprived of his offspring and cattle. In that case there is an expiation.\n\n14:3:2:22\\. He offers an oblation of a full (spoon of ghee); for the full\nmeans everything: with everything he thus heals whatever has been unsuccessful\nin the sacrifice.\n\n14:3:2:33\\. [He offers, with Va _g_. S. XXXIX, 1,] 'Hail to the vital airs\nwith their over-lord!'--the over-lord of the vital airs, doubtless, is the\nmind (soul), for in the mind all the vital airs are established: it is thus by\nmeans of the mind that he thereby heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the\nsacrifice.\n\np. 505\n\n14:3:2:44\\. 'To the Earth hail!'--the earth, doubtless, is a place of abode\nfor all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals\nwhatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.\n\n14:3:2:55\\. 'To Agni hail!'--Agni, doubtless, is the self of all the gods: it\nis thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been\nunsuccessful in the sacrifice.\n\n14:3:2:66\\. 'To the Air hail!'--the air, doubtless, is a place of abode for\nall the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever\nhas been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.\n\n14:3:2:77\\. 'To Vayu hail!'--Vayu (the wind), doubtless, is the self of all\nthe gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has\nbeen unsuccessful in the sacrifice.\n\n14:3:2:88\\. 'To the Sky hail!'--the sky, doubtless, is a place of abode for\nall the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever\nhas been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.\n\n14:3:2:99\\. 'To Surya hail!'--Surya (the sun), doubtless, is the self of all\nthe gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has\nbeen unsuccessful in the sacrifice.\n\n14:3:2:1010\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXIX, 2,] 'To the Regions hail!'--the regions,\ndoubtless, are a place of abode for all the gods: it is thus by means of all\nthe deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.\n\n14:3:2:1111\\. 'To _K_ andra hail!'-- _K_ andra (the moon), doubtless, is the\nself of all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals\nwhatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.\n\n14:3:2:1212\\. 'To the Nakshatras hail!'--the Nakshatras\n\np. 506\n\n[paragraph continues] (lunar asterisms), doubtless, are a place of abode for\nall the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever\nhas been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.\n\n14:3:2:1313\\. 'To the Waters hail!'--the waters, doubtless, are a place of\nabode for all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals\nwhatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.\n\n14:3:2:1414\\. 'To Varu _n_ a hail!'--Varu _n_ a, doubtless, is the self of all\nthe gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has\nbeen unsuccessful in the sacrifice.\n\n14:3:2:1515\\. 'To the Navel hail! To the Purified one 1 hail!'--This is\nundefined, for undefined is Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is the sacrifice:\nit is thus Pra _g_ apati, the sacrifice, he thereby heals.\n\n14:3:2:1616\\. These are thirteen oblations,--for there are thirteen months in\nthe year, and the year is Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is the sacrifice:\nit is thus Pra _g_ apati, the sacrifice, he thereby heals.\n\n14:3:2:1717\\. [Va _g_. S.

With (Va _g_. S. XXXIX, 4), 'The mind's purpose,'--by the mind,\nindeed, everything is gained here: by the mind he thus heals whatever has been\nunsuccessful in the sacrifice;--\n\n14:3:2:2020\\. 'The truth of speech may I freely obtain,'--by speech everything\nis gained here: by speech he thus heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the\nsacrifice;--'may the form of cattle, the essence of food, fame, and prosperity\naccrue unto me, hail!'--a blessing he thereby invokes.\n\n14:3:2:2121\\. Thereupon, having pounded that spare (clay), and mixed it with\npowdered clay, he makes (a pot) in proper form, and bakes it in proper form\nfor the purpose of the 'setting out'; and let him perform (the sacrifice) with\nwhichever of the two reserve (pots) may be firm.\n\n14:3:2:2222\\. The Pravargya, indeed, is the year; for the year is everything,\nand the Pravargya is everything: when it is placed on the fire then it is\nspring; when it is burning-hot then it is summer; when it is flowing over then\nit is the rainy season;--but, indeed, when the rains overflow, all the gods\nand all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the rains overflow for him who\nthus knows this.\n\n14:3:2:2323\\. The Pravargya, indeed, is these worlds, for these worlds are\neverything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it is placed on the fire\nthen it is this (terrestrial) world; when it is burning-hot then it is the\nair-world; and when it flows over then it is yonder (heavenly) world;--but,\n\np. 508\n\nindeed; when yonder world overflows, all the gods and all beings subsist\nthereon; and, verily, yonder world overflows for him who thus knows this.\n\n14:3:2:2424\\.

The Pravargya, indeed, is the Sacrificer, his own self, his\noffspring (or people) and cattle; for the Sacrificer is everything, and the\nPravargya is everything when it is placed on the fire then it is his own self;\nwhen it is burning-hot then it is his offspring; and when it flows over then\nit is his cattle;--but, indeed, when the cattle overflow (with milk) all the\ngods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the cattle overflow for him\nwho thus knows this.\n\n14:3:2:2626\\. The Pravargya, indeed, is the Agnihotra, for the Agnihotra is\neverything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the Agnihotra milk) is\nput on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; when it is ladled out\nthen it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then it is the\noverflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when the Agnihotra overflows all the gods\nand all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the Agnihotra overflows for him\nwho thus knows this.\n\n14:3:2:2727\\. The Pravargya, indeed, is the New and Full-moon sacrifices; for\nthe New and Full-moon sacrifices\n\np. 509\n\nare everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the havis) is put on\nthe fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; when it is standing ready\nthen it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then it is the\noverflowing (Gharma); but, indeed, when the New and Full-moon sacrifices\noverflow all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the New and\nFull-moon sacrifices overflow for him who thus knows this.\n\n14:3:2:2828\\. The Pravargya, indeed, is the Seasonal sacrifices, for the\nSeasonal sacrifices are everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it\n(the havis) is put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; when it\nis standing ready then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered\nthen it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when the Seasonal\nsacrifices overflow then all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and,\nverily, the Seasonal sacrifices overflow for him who thus knows this.\n\n14:3:2:2929\\. The Pravargya, indeed, is the Animal sacrifice, for the Animal\nsacrifice is everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the meat)\nis put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; and when it is\nstanding ready then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered\nthen it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when the animal offering\noverflows all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the animal\noffering overflows for him who thus knows this.\n\n14:3:2:3030\\. The Pravargya, indeed, is Soma, for Soma is everything, and the\nPravargya is everything: when it is poured out then it is the (Gharma) placed\non the fire; when it is drawn (into the\n\np. 510\n\ncups) then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then it is\nthe overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when Soma overflows all the gods and\nall beings avail themselves thereof; and, verily, Soma overflows for him who\nthus knows this; and, verily, no sacrifice whatever is offered without the\nPravargya for him who thus knows this.\n\n14:3:2:3131\\. And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this\n(Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance of the rule\nthereof is the same as at the creation 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[506:1](sbe44124.htm#fr_1325) Mahidhara takes 'puta' in the sense of 'the\npurifier ( _s_ odhaka)' and apparently the name of a god (as he does also the\nNavel (nabhyai devatayai)).\n\n[510:1](sbe44124.htm#fr_1326) See [p. 458](sbe44118.htm#page_458), note\n[1](sbe44118.htm#fn_1211).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Index to Parts III, IV, and V.](sbe44125.htm)\n\n"
