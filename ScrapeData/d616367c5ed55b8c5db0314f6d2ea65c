They who have risen out of the drink of the white-backed one, have entered\nthe two parents, the seven sounds. The (all-)encompassing parents come\ntogether; they go forth to aspire after long life\n[1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:1:1).\n\n2\\. The milch-cows dwelling in heaven [1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:2:1) are the\nmares of the manly one. He has bestridden the goddesses who carry the sweet\n(food) [2](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:2:2). Thee who livest in peace in the abode of\n_Ri_ ta, the one cow [3](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:2:3) circumambulates, making her\nway.\n\n3\\. He has mounted the (mares) [1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:3:1) that became well-\nmanageable, the wise lord, the finder of riches. He with the dark blue back,\nwith many faces, has made them depart from the drink of the brush-wood\n[2](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:3:2).\n\n4\\. Giving mighty vigour to the never-ageing son of Tvash _t_ _ri_\n[1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:4:1), the streams [2](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:4:2) carry\nHim the firmly fixed one. Flashing in his abode with his limbs he has entered\nupon the two worlds as if they were one.\n\n5\\. They know friendship towards the manly, the red one, and they delight in\nthe command of ruddy (Agni), (the gods) shining from heaven, resplendent with\nbright shine, to whose host I _l_ a belongs, the mighty praise.\n\n6\\. And finding it out by following the noise they brought to the great one\'s\ngreat parents a song of praise, when the bull about nightfall (?) has grown\nstrong according to the singer\'s own law [1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:6:1).\n\np. "9"\n\n7\\. With the five Adhvaryus the seven priests watch the beloved footstep which\nthe bird has made [1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:7:1). Turned forwards the never-\nageing bulls [2](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:7:2) rejoice: for they, being gods, have\nfollowed the laws of the gods.\n\n8 = III, 4, 7.\n\n9\\. The many (mares) are full of desire for the mighty stallion. For the\nmanly, bright one, the reins easily direct (the horses)\n[1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:9:1). Divine Hot _ri_! Thou who art a great joy-giver\nand wise, bring hither the great gods and the two worlds\n[2](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:9:2).\n\n10\\. The dawns, O wealth-giver, the mighty sacrificers\n[1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:10:1), well spoken and bright have shone with wealth.\nAnd by the earth\'s greatness [2](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:10:2), O Agni, forgive us\neven committed sin [3](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:10:3), that we may be great.\n\n11 = III, 1, 23.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--No verse of this hymn occurs in the other Sa _m_\nhitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. On the meaning of this difficult verse conjectures only can be given.\nThe white-backed one may be Agni. If this is right, \'they who have risen out\nof Agni\'s drink,\' may be Agni\'s rays or flames (ye ra _s_ maya _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 prakarshe\n_n_ odga _k_ _kh_ anti, Saya _n_ a); these flames enter upon the two mothers,\ni. e. Heaven and Earth, and upon the seven sounds, the sacrificial songs which\nare identified with the terrestrial and celestial seven rivers (comp. above,\nIII, 1, 6). All this rests on the supposition that the traditional text is\ncorrect. Now Ludwig remarks with reference\n\np. 250\n\nto the pronoun ye: \'Warscheinlicher ist, dass wir hier eine archaistische\nanwendung der form auf e fur fem. vor uns haben,\' and Griffith says that ye is\n\'apparently used for the feminine.\' I do not believe in this possibility, but\nfor ye (ya) the true reading may be ya\xc2\xb4( _h_ ). In this case the seven va _n_\nis would be subject: \'They who have risen out of the drink of the white-backed\none, the seven sounds have entered the two parents.\' The meaning of this may\nbe: The sacrificial songs, rising as it were out of the offering made to Agni,\nand in the same way the streams of water which, in the shape of clouds of\nsmoke rise out of the offering (comp. I, 164, 51), have gone to Heaven and\nEarth.\n\nThat the parents in the third Pada are again Heaven and Earth is shown by X,\n65, 8. parikshita pitara \xe2\x80\xa6 dya\xc2\xb4vap _ri_ thivi\xc2\xb4. It may be observed that the\nauthor of X, 65 (see especially the verses 6-8) evidently imitated the\nexpressions of the hymn, III, 7. \'The coming together of Heaven and Earth\nmarks the beginning of the day and of the year.\' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. On divakshas, comp. Joh. Schmidt, Pluralbildungen der Neutra, 417 seq.\n\nNote 2. The milch-cows, mares, or goddesses seem to be the celestial waters or\nDawns.\n\nNote 3. Comp. X, 65, 6, quoted at the end of this note. Is the cow (Va _k_ ,\naccording to Saya _n_ a) the Dawn which daily returns in her due way? Or the\nbutter offered to Agni? In our verse and in the parallel passage, X, 65, 6,\nthe vartani of the cow is mentioned; it may be observed that the vartani of\nUshas is referred to in X, 172, 1. 4. And Ushas is represented in I, 123, 9 as\ncoming to the nishk _ri_ ta: comp. X, 65, 6. ya\xc2\xb4 gau _h_ vartanim pari-eti ni\n_h_ -k _ri_ tam.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. See verse 2.\n\nNote 2. The meaning may possibly be the following. The Waters dwell in the\nplants as their sap (comp. H. O.,\n\np. 251\n\n[paragraph continues] Religion des Veda, 113). Agni, when burning or drinking\nas it were, the brushwood, destroys this dwelling of the Waters; he makes the\nWaters depart from the wood.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. On Agni as the son of Tvash _t_ _ri_ , see Hillebrandt, Vedische\nMythologie, I, 522 seq.\n\nNote 2. \'Could vahata _h_ be the suyama _h_ of verse 3?\' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Or, \'when the singer\'s bull \xe2\x80\xa6 has grown strong according to his own\nlaw\'? The bull, of course, is Agni.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. See above, 5, 5. 6.\n\nNote 2. The flames of Agni?\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Ra _s_ maya _h_ , \'the reins,\' at the same time means \'the rays\' (of\nAgni). Suyama\xc2\xb4 _h_ being an apposition to ra _s_ maya _h_ , one is tempted to\nderive it from the root yam, \'to direct,\' but it may contain the word ya\xc2\xb4ma,\n\'the way,\' and mean \'having a good way.\'--It is difficult to believe that ra\n_s_ maya _h_ suyama\xc2\xb4 _h_ is a second subject of v _ri_ shayante, in which case\nthe translation would be: \'The many (mares) are desirous of the mighty\nstallion, the \xe2\x80\xa6 reins (or rays) of the manly, bright one.\'\n\nNote 2. \'Bring hither to the two worlds the great gods.\' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. On p _ri_ ksha-praya _g_ a _h_ , comp. M. M., val. xxxii, p. 335;\nPischel, Vedische Studien, I, 98.\n\nNote 2. The meaning seems to be: By thy greatness which is equal to that of\nthe earth.\n\nNote 3. Comp. X, 63, 8. k _ri_ ta\xc2\xb4t ak _ri_ tat enasa _h_. See also I, 24, 9;\nVI, 51, 8.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 8](sbe46068.htm)\n\n'
