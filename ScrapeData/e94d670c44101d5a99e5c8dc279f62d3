He (the sun), who shines, honoured this world (the body of the worshipper,\nby entering into it), in the form of man 2 (the worshipper who meditates on\nbreath). For he who shines (the sun) is (the same as) the breath. He honoured\nthis (body of the worshipper) during a hundred years, therefore there are a\nhundred years in the life of a man. Because he honoured him during a hundred\nyears, therefore there are (the poets of the first Ma _n_ _d_ ala of the Rig-\nveda, called) the Satar _k_ in, (having honour for a\n\np. 215\n\nhundred years.) Therefore people call him who is really Pra _n_ a (breath),\nthe Satar _k_ in poets 1.\n\n2\\. He (breath) placed himself in the midst of all whatsoever exists. Because\nhe placed himself in the midst of all whatsoever exists, therefore there are\n(the poets of the second to the ninth Ma _n_ _d_ ala of the Rig-veda, called)\nthe Madhyamas. Therefore people call him who is really Pra _n_ a (breath), the\nMadhyama poets.\n\n3\\. He as up-breathing is the swallower (g _ri_ tsa), as down-breathing he is\ndelight (mada). Because as up-breathing he is swallower (g _ri_ tsa) and as\ndown-breathing delight (mada), therefore there is (the poet of the second Ma\n_n_ _d_ ala of the Rig-veda, called) G _ri_ tsamada. Therefore people call him\nwho is really Pra _n_ a (breath), Gritsamada.\n\n4\\. Of him. (breath) all this whatsoever was a friend. Because of him all (vi\n_s_ vam) this whatsoever was a friend (mitram), therefore there is (the poet\nof the third Ma _n_ _d_ ala of the Rig-veda, called) Vi _s_ vamitra. Therefore\npeople call him who is really Pra _n_ a (breath), Vi _s_ vamitra.\n\n5\\. The Devas (speech, &c.) said to him (the breath): 'He is to be loved by\nall of us.' Because the Devas said of him, that he was to be loved (vama) by\nall of them, therefore there is (the poet of the fourth Ma _n_ _d_ ala of the\nRig-veda, called) Vamadeva. Therefore people call him who is really Pra _n_ a\n(breath), Vamadeva.\n\n6\\. He (breath) guarded all this whatsoever from evil. Because he guarded\n(atrayata) all this whatsoever\n\np. 216\n\nfrom evil, therefore there are (the poets of the fifth Ma _n_ _d_ ala of the\nRig-veda, called) Atraya _h_. Therefore people call him who is really Pra _n_\na (breath), Atraya _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[214:1](sbe01210.htm#fr_527) In the first adhyaya various forms of meditating\non Uktha, conceived as Pra _n_ a (life), have been declared. In the second\nsome other forms of meditation, all extremely fanciful, are added. They are of\ninterest, however, as showing the existence of the hymns of the Rig-veda,\ndivided and arranged as we now possess them, at the time when this \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka was composed.\n\n[214:2](sbe01210.htm#fr_528) The identity of the sun and of breath as living\nin man has been established before. It is the same power in both, conceived\neither adhidaivatam (mythological) or adhyatmam (physiological).\n\n[215:1](sbe01210.htm#fr_529) The real ground for the name is that the poets of\nthe first Ma _n_ _d_ ala composed on an average each about a hundred _Ri_ _k_\n, verses.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 2](sbe01211.htm)\n\n"
