Be it known\nthat in his youth, when he loved to go a-hunting, he heard in the jungle\ndepths one evening a gurgling of water, and thought an elephant or a deer had\ncome to drink from a hidden stream. He drew his bow; he aimed at the sound and\ndischarged an arrow. . . . A human voice uttered a cry of agony. . . .\nBreaking through the tangled jungle growth, Dasaratha discovered that he had\nmortally wounded a young hermit who had come to draw water for his aged\nparents. The poor victim forgave the king and counselled him, saying: "Hasten\nto my sire and inform him of my fate, lest his curse should consume thee as a\nfire consumes a withered tree." Then he expired.\n\nDismayed and sorrowing deeply, Dasaratha went towards the dwelling of the\nboy\'s parents, who were blind and old. He heard the father cry: "Ah! why hast\nthou lingered, my son? I am athirst, and thy mother longs for thee."\n\nIn broken accents the king informed the lonesome\n\np. 395\n\nparents of their son\'s death. The sire lamented aloud, and said: "Oh! lead me\nto my son. Let me embrace him for the last time."\n\nDasaratha conducted the weeping parents to the spot where the lad lay lifeless\nand stained with blood. The sire clasped the body, and cried: "Oh! wilt thou\nnot speak and greet me, my son? Thou liest on the ground; thou dost not answer\nme when I call. Alas! thou canst not love me any longer. . . . Thy mother is\nhere. Oh! thou who wert dutiful and kind, speak but one tender word to her and\nto me. . . . Who will now read to us each morning the holy books? Who will now\nfind roots and fruits to feed us? . . . Oh! tarry with us yet a little longer,\nmy son. Wait for us ere thou dost depart to the Kingdom of Death--stay but one\nday longer, and on the morrow thy father and mother will go with thee on the\nweary and darksome path of no returning. . . . How can we live now that our\nchild and protector is taken from us?"\n\nSo the blind old hermit lamented. Then he spake to the king, and said: "I had\nbut this one child and thou hast made me childless. Now slay me also, because\nDeath is blunted and unable to hurt me any more. . . . A father cannot feel\ngreater agony than when he sorrows for a beloved son. This peculiar sharp\nsorrow thou wilt yet know, O king. As I weep now, and as I am hastened to\ndeath, mourning for my son, so wilt thou suffer in like manner, sorrowing for\na dearly-beloved and righteous son. Thy death, O Dasaratha, will cleanse thee\nof this crime."\n\nHaving spoken thus, the hermit built the funeral pyre for the dead boy, and\nwhen it was lit he and his wife leapt amidst the flames and entered the\nKingdom of Death.\n\np. 396\n\nAfter Rama had departed from Ayodhya, his mother, Kausalya, reproached\nDasaratha, saying: "Thou wouldst not break thy promise to Kaikeyi, but thou\ndidst break thy promise made to thy counsellors that Rama should be thy\nsuccessor."\n\nThe Maharajah was bowed down with grief; and cried: "Oh! forgive me, Kausalya,\nbecause my heart is breaking while I mourn for my beloved son. Oh! do not\nwound me again, I pray thee."\n\nKausalya wept and said: "Alas! my grief hath made me speak cruelly to thee."\n\nIn the middle of the second night after Rama had departed, Dasaratha awoke and\ncried: "O Kausalya, I am dying with grief. Mine eyes have grown blind with\nweeping. Take my hand in thine and speak unto me. Oh! bitterly I grieve now\nthat I cannot look upon Rama ere I die. Happy are they whose eyes behold him .\n. . My heart beats feebly." . . .\n\nWhen he had spoken thus, Dasaratha fell back and was silent. Kausalya, mother\nof Rama, and Sumitra, mother of Lakshmana, knelt beside him, and they swooned\nwhen his spirit fled.\n\nIn the morning messengers were sent speedily to Bharata, who sojourned in the\nkingdom of the Kaikeyas with his mother\'s sire, the rajah Aswapati, bidding\nhim to return without delay. Seven nights passed while the prince journeyed\ntowards Ayodhya. He knew not that Dasaratha had died until he reached the\npalace. Then Kaikeyi, his mother, informed him without tears. Bharata wept,\nand flung himself down upon the floor and cried aloud.\n\nKaikeyi said: "Thou shouldst not thus give way to grief; my son."\n\nSaid Bharata: "If the Maharajah were alive, he would\n\np. 397\n\nhave embraced and kissed me on my return. But where is Rama, who is now as a\nsire unto me?"\n\nThen Kaikeyi told him all that had taken place, and said: "For thy sake, my\nson, I have accomplished this. Sorrow not, because thou wilt be installed as\nruler here."\n\nSaid Bharata: "I have lost my father and my elder brother. Of what good is a\nkingdom unto me now? O evil-hearted woman, thou hast bereft this house of all\njoy; thou hast slain my sire and banished Rama. . . . But I will bring my\nbrother back from the jungle; he shall be seated on the throne."\n\nSatrughna sorrowed like Bharata, and when he beheld the wicked hunchback\nManthara he threw her down and dragged her across the floor, saying: "This\nhateful  creature is the cause of our calamities. I will slay her."\n\nKaikeyi flew away in terror, and Bharata said: "Slay her not, because she is a\nwoman. I would have killed my wicked mother, but, had I done so, Rama would\nne\'er have forgiven me nor have spoken to me again. Spare this wretch, O\nSatrughna, lest Rama should be angry with thee."\n\nKausalya, mother of Rama, then approached Bharata and said: "The raj is now\nthine, O ambitious one. Thy mother hath secured it for thee."\n\nBharata fell at her feet and vowed that he would never sit on the throne, but\nwould hasten after Rama to entreat him to return.\n\nThen Kausalya wept and embraced him because that he was loyal to his elder\nbrother.\n\nWhen Bharata had performed the funeral rites for the Maharajah, he left\nAyodhya with a strong army to search for Rama.\n\nThe two brothers met in the jungle of Chitra-kuta,\n\np. 398\n\nand they embraced one another and wept for their dead sire.\n\nIn the morning Bharata spake to Rama in the presence of the army, saying:\n"This raj, which was given unto me against my will, I now gift unto thee, mine\nelder brother. Accept it and remove the stain of my mother\'s sin."\n\nSaid Rama: "O Bharata, my royal sire, fulfilling his vow, banished me to the\njungle and appointed thee to the raj. A faithful son cannot recall the mandate\nof his sire."\n\nThen Java\xc2\xb4li, the Brahmanic counsellor of Dasaratha, spake and said: "O Rama,\nwhy dim thine understanding with empty maxims? Thou hast already obeyed thy\nsire. It is foolish to think that thou shouldst continue this allegiance to\none who is dead. A man enters the world alone and departs alone; he owns not\nfriendship to kindred. His parents are to him like a wayside inn which he\nleaves in the morning; his allegiance to them is temporary. He meets them like\na traveller who tarries on his journey and then goes on his way as before. In\nthis world we have only one life to live. If thou wilt refuse this raj thou\nwilt destroy thy one life. I am sorry for those who scorn the blessings of\nthis world so long as they are alive in the hope that they will reach a\nParadise which does not exist. When this life is spent we are extinguished for\never. Alas! that men should make to their ancestors useless offerings. Can a\ndead man eat thereof? These offerings are a waste of food. If the soul endures\nand passes into a new body how can it benefit from food eaten by another?\nThese practices were invented by cunning priests with selfish motives. . . .\nThere is no Hereafter. Therefore snatch the joys of life while thou canst, O\nRama, take the raj which is offered to thee and return to Ayodhya."\n\np. 399\n\nSaid Rama, whose heart was filled with anger: "O Javali, thy motive is\nexcellent but thy doctrines are false. A good man is distinguished from an\nevil man by his deeds. How can I, who have embraced a virtuous life, turn now\ninto the path of evildoing? The gods who read a man\'s heart would curse me for\nmy sins. Vain are thine idle words; thy reasoning is cunning but false. Truth\nis our ancient path. Truth endures when all else passes away. The venom of\nfalsehood is more deadly than the venom of a serpent\'s sting. Thou hast said\nthat there is no Hereafter, and that we should snatch pleasures while life\nendures. If that is so, why do wise men condemn what is evil if the vicious\nare simply pursuing the quest of happiness? Why do sages live austere lives,\neating fruits and roots, instead of feasting on flesh and drinking wine? There\nwould be no sciences if we believed only those things we behold. Inferential\nproof must be permitted. Is a woman to consider herself a widow when her\nhusband is out of sight? . . . Know, all of ye, that I will be faithful to the\nmandate of my sire. I will keep my promise which I cannot recall. Let Bharata\nreign, for I will dwell in the jungle."\n\nBharata said: "If my sire\'s wish must be fulfilled, let me remain in the\njungle for fourteen years so that Rama may return to Ayodhya."\n\nSaid Rama: "Neither Bharata nor I can recall or change the commands of\nDasaratha."\n\nThereafter Bharata gave to Rama a pair of new sandals decked with gold,\nsaying: "Put these upon thy feet and they shall accomplish the good of all."\n\nRama put on the sandals and then returned them to his brother, who said: "I\nwill live as a devotee for fourteen years with matted hair and in a robe of\nbark.\n\np. 400\n\n[paragraph continues] These sandals, O Rama, will be placed upon the throne\nwhich I will guard for thee. If thou dost not return when the time of thy\npenance is ended, I will perish upon the pyre."\n\nThe brethren then took leave of one another. Bharata returned to Ayodhya, and\nto his counsellors spake, saying: "I will dwell outside the city in Nandigrama\nuntil Rama returns again."\n\nThen he clad himself in bark and went to the jungle. There he conducted the\naffairs of government, holding the royal umbrella over Rama\'s sandals. All\npresents which were given were first presented to the sandals, because Bharata\nruled the kingdom for his elder brother. The sandals of Rama were the symbol\nof royal authority.\n\nMeanwhile Rama with Sita and Lakshmana went southward towards deeper jungles,\nvisiting various holy sages, and having crossed the Vindhya mountains, they\nwandered together in the Deccan and Southern India. At Panchavati 1, nigh to\nthe sources of the river Godavari, the royal exiles built a hut with four\nrooms, and lived peaceful and pious lives. Thirteen years and a half went over\ntheir heads.\n\nIt came to pass that one day there came to the quiet hermitage a Rakshasa\nwoman, named Surpa-nakha, the sister of Ravana, the demon King of Lanka,\nCeylon. She was misshapen and ugly and her voice was harsh and unpleasant.\nWhen she beheld Rama, who was comely as a lotus, and of lofty and loyal\nbearing, her heart was filled with love for him. Made bold with this love, she\nresolved to assume another form so as to induce him to leave the faithful\nSita. . . . In time she stood before the prince in the guise of a young and\nbeautiful woman, and said: "Who art thou who hast\n\n\n\n[![RAMA SPURNS THE DEMON LOVER<br> <i>From the painting by Warwick\nGoble</i>.](tn/40000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/40000.jpg)  \nRAMA SPURNS THE DEMON LOVER  \n_From the painting by Warwick Goble_.  \n\n\n\np. 401\n\ncome hither with thy bride to dwell in this lone jungle which is haunted by\nRakshasas?"\n\nSaid Rama: "I am Rama, the elder son of a Maharajah named Dasaratha. I dwell\nhere in exile in fulfilment of my sire\'s vow, with Sita, my spouse, and\nLakshmana, my brother. Why dost thou, O fair one, who art as beautiful as the\nbride of Vishnu, wander about here all alone?"\n\nSurpa-nakha said: "I am a Rakshasa woman, the sister of Ravana, and have come\nhither because I love thee. I have chosen thee for my husband, and thou shalt\nrule over my great empire. Thy Sita is pale and deformed and unworthy of thee,\nbut I am of surpassing beauty and have power to assume any form at will. I\nmust devour Sita and thy brother, so that we may range the jungle together and\nvisit the lofty hills."\n\nSaid Rama: "Sita is my beloved bride, nor would I leave her. But Lakshmana\nhath no consort and is a fit husband for thee."\n\nSurpa-nakha at once departed from Rama, and went and found Lakshmana, who\njested with her.\n\nThen the enraged Rakshasa woman sprang towards Sita in jealous anger, but Rama\nthrust her back. Like to lightning Lakshmana leapt forward with his sword and\ncut off the ears and nose of the evil-hearted Surpa-nakha, whereat she\nshrieked and fled away, wailing like to the storm wind. The rocks answered\nback her awesome cries.\n\nSurpa-nakha hastened to one of her brothers who was named Khara, and when he\nsaw her disfigured and bleeding, he cried: "None but a Celestial could have\ndone this deed. This day will I drink the blood of Indra as a crane drinks\nmilk and water."\n\nThen Surpa-nakha related what had taken place, and\n\np. 402\n\nsaid: "Rama and Lakshmana attacked me to protect the woman Sita, whose life-\nblood I desired to drink. I entreat thee to bring her to me now."\n\nKhara called upon fourteen Rakshasas and commanded them to capture the three\nroyal hermits who dwelt in Dandaka jungle. They hastened away and Surpa-nakha\nwent with them, but soon she returned wailing, because Rama had slain the\nRakshasas with Celestial arrows.\n\nKhara immediately called upon his brother Dush\xc2\xb4ana, saying: "Assemble an army\nof fourteen thousand Rakshasas, and bring my weapons and my chariot with white\nhorses, for, verily, this day I must kill the hateful Rama."\n\nEvil were the omens as the army marched to battle. Jackals howled and birds\nscreamed at dawn; the sky was blood-red, and Rahu endeavoured to swallow the\nsun and caused an awesome eclipse; a headless horror appeared in mid air. The\narrows of Rama emitted smoke, and he said to Lakshmana: "Hasten with Sita to a\nsecret cave in the mountains and protect her there. I will battle with the\ndemons alone."\n\nLakshmana did as his brother commanded. Then Rama girt on his glowing armour,\nand, armed with a Celestial bow and many arrows, he awaited the coming of his\nenemies. When the Rakshasas appeared they quailed before him, because he\nappeared like to Yama at a Yuga end, but Khara drove on in his chariot, urging\nhis followers to attack; they followed him roaring like a tempest, and they\nappeared like to black tremendous clouds rushing towards the rising sun.\n\nThousands of weapons were showered against Rama, who began to discharge\nflaming arrows, which swept among the Rakshasas like fire in a sun-dried\nforest, so that many were mangled and slain. Still Khara and his brother\ncontinued to attack; but Rama seized a great Celestial weapon\n\np. 403\n\nand slew Dushana and scattered the demon army in flight. Khara sought to\navenge his brother\'s death, but Rama drew his bow and shot a blazing arrow\nwhich consumed him instantly. So was the battle won, and Sita came forth from\nthe cave and embraced her heroic husband and kissed him.\n\nOf all the Rakshasa host only Surpa-nakha escaped alive. She hastened to Lanka\nand informed the ten-headed King Ravana of the death of his brothers, and\nsaid: "Thou canst not defeat Rama in battle. But he may be overcome by guile.\nHe hath a beautiful spouse, whose name is Sita, and she is dearer to him than\nlife. If thou wilt take her captive, Rama can be slain, because he is unable\nto exist without her."\n\nSaid Ravana: "I will bring Sita hither in my chariot."\n\nOn the morrow Ravana and his brother Maricha, whom Rama had aforetime driven\nfar across the ocean with a Celestial weapon, went towards the hermitage of\nthe royal exiles in a resplendent chariot which went through the air like a\ngreat bird; it was drawn by asses which had the heads of Rakshasas.\n\nMaricha assumed the shape of a golden deer with silvern spots; its horns were\ntipped with sapphire and its eyes were like to blue lotus blooms. This\nbeautiful animal of gentle seeming grazed below the trees until Sita beheld it\nwith wondering eyes as she came forth to pluck wild flowers. She called to\nRama, saying: "A deer of wondrous beauty is wandering through the grove. I\nlong to rest at ease on its golden skin."\n\nSaid Rama: "O Lakshmana, I must fulfil the desire of Sita. Tarry with her\nuntil I obtain this animal for her."\n\nSo speaking, he lifted his bow and hastened away through the trees.\n\np. 404\n\nLakshmana spoke to Sita and said: "My heart is full of misgiving. Sages have\ntold that Rakshasas are wont to assume the forms of deer. Ofttimes have\nmonarchs been waylaid in the forest by artful demons who came to lure them\naway."\n\nRama chased the deer a long time hither and thither through the forest, and at\nlength he shot an arrow which pierced its heart. In his agony Maricha sprang\nout of the deer\'s body, and cried out in imitation of Rama\'s voice: " _Sita,\nSita, save me! O save me, Lakshmana!_ " Then he died, and Rama perceived that\nhe had slain the Rakshasa Maricha, brother of Ravana.\n\nSita\'s heart was filled with alarm when she heard the voice of the Rakshasa\ncalling in imitation of her husband. She spake to Lakshmana, saying: "Hasten\nand help my Rama; he calls for help."\n\nSaid Lakshmana: "Do not fear for Rama, O fair one. No Rakshasa can injure him.\nI must obey his command and remain beside thee. The cry thou hast heard is an\nillusion wrought by demons."\n\nSita was wroth; her eyes sparkled and her voice shook as she spake, saying:\n"Hath thine heart grown callous? Art thou thy brother\'s enemy? Rama is in\nperil, and yet thou dost not hasten to succour him. Hast thou followed him to\nthe forest desiring that he should die, so as to obtain his widow by force? If\nso, thy hope is a delusion, because I will not live one moment after he dies.\nIt is useless, therefore, for thee to tarry here."\n\nSaid Lakshmana, whose eyes were filled with tears: "I do not fear for Rama. .\n. . O Sita! thy words scald me, for thou art as a mother unto me. I cannot\nanswer thee. My heart is free from sin. . . . Alas! that fickle women with\npoisonous tongues should endeavour to set brother against brother."\n\np. 405\n\nSita wept, and Lakshmana, repenting that he had spoken harshly, said: "I will\nobey thee and hasten unto Rama. May the spirits of the forest protect thee\nagainst hidden enemies. I am troubled because I behold evil omens. When I\nreturn, may I behold Rama by thy side."\n\nSaid Sita: "If Rama is slain I will die by drowning, or by poison, or else by\nthe noose. I cannot live without Rama."\n\nRavana kept watch the while, and when he saw Lakshmana leaving the hermitage,\nhe assumed the guise of a forest sage and went towards the lonely and sad-\nhearted Sita. The jungle had grown silent. Ravana saw that Sita was beautiful\nas the solitary moon at midnight when it illumines the gloomy forest. He\nspake, saying: "O woman of golden beauty, O shy one in full bloom, robed in\nsilk and adorned with flowers, art thou Sri, or Gauri, 1 or the goddess of\nlove, or a nymph of the forest? Red as coral are thy lips; thy teeth shine\nlike to jasmine; love dwelleth in thine eyes so soft and lustrous. Slender art\nthou and tall, with shapely limbs, and a bosom like to ripe fruit. . . .\nWherefore, O fair one, with long shining tresses, dost thou linger here in the\nlonesome jungle? More seemly it were if thou didst adorn a stately palace.\nChoose thee a royal suitor; be the bride of a king. What god is thy sire, O\nbeautiful one?"\n\nSita honoured Ravana, believing that he was a Brahman. She told him the story\nof Rama\'s exile, and said: "Rest thyself here until the jungle-ranging\nbrethren return to greet thee."\n\nThen Ravana said: "No Brahman am I, but the ruler of the vengeful Rakshasas. I\nam Ravana, King of Lanka, dreaded by even the gods. Thy beauty, O fair one,\nclad\n\np. 406\n\nin yellow silk, has taken captive my heart. Be my chief queen, O Sita, and\nfive thousand handmaidens will wait upon thee. Share mine empire and my fame."\n\nSaid Sita, whose eyes flashed fiery anger: a Knowest thou Rama, the god-like\nhero who is ever victorious in strife? I am his wedded wife. Knowest thou\nRama, the sinless and saintly one, who is strongly armed and full of valour\nand virtue? I am his wedded wife. What madness hath prompted thee to woo the\nwife of so mighty a warrior? I follow Rama as a lioness follows a lion. Canst\nthou, a prowling jackal, hope to obtain a lioness? Snatch from the jaws of a\nlion the calf which it is devouring, touch the fang of a cobra when it seizeth\na fallen victim, or tear up a mountain by the roots, or seize the sun in\nheaven before thou dost seek to win or capture the wife of Rama, the avenger."\n\nRavana boasted his prowess, saying: "I have power to slay even Yama. I can\ntorture the sun and shoot arrows through the earth. Little dost thou know of\nmy glory and my heroism."\n\nThen he changed his shape and stood up in gigantic demon form with vast body\nand ten heads and twenty arms. . . . Seizing Sita, he soared through the air\nwith her as Garuda carries off the queen of serpents; he placed her in his\nchariot and went away swifter than the wind.\n\nThe unseen spirits of the jungle looked on, and they heard the cries of Sita\nas she called in vain for Rama and Lakshmana. Jatayus 1, Monarch of Vultures,\nwho lay asleep on a mountain top, heard her and awoke; he darted upon Ravana\nlike to the thunderbolt of Indra. A fierce battle was fought in mid air.\nJatayus destroyed the chariot and killed the Rakshasa asses, but Ravana\n\np. 407\n\ntook Sita in his arms, and, soaring higher than the Vulture king, disabled him\nwith his sword.\n\nThen Ravana continued his journey towards Lanka, floating in the air. As he\npassed over the Mountain of Apes, Sita contrived to cast off her ornaments,\nand they dropped through the air like falling stars. . . . The five apes found\nthem and said: "Ravana is carrying away some beautiful woman who calls upon\nRama and Lakshmana."\n\nWhen Ravana reached his palace he delivered Sita to a band of Rakshasa women,\ncommanding them to guard her by day and by night.\n\nLong and loudly did Rama lament when he returned to the forest hut and found\nthat it was empty. He knew that, Sita had been carried away, but whither he\nknew not.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[400:1](iml30.htm#fr_340) Nasik.
