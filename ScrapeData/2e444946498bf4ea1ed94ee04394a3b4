And from this very reason there follows the eternity of the Veda.\n\nAs the eternity of the Veda is founded on the absence of the remembrance of an\nagent only, a doubt with regard to it had been raised owing to the doctrine\nthat the gods and other individuals have sprung from it. That doubt has been\nrefuted in the preceding Sutra.--The present Sutra now confirms the, already\nestablished, eternity of the Veda. The eternity of the word of the Veda has to\nbe assumed for this very reason, that the world with its definite (eternal)\nspecies, such as gods and so on, originates from it.--A mantra also ('By means\nof the sacrifice they followed the trace of speech; they found it dwelling in\nthe _ri_ shis,' _Ri_ g-veda Sa _m_ h. X, 71, 3) shows that the speech found\n(by the _ri_ shis) was permanent.--On this point Vedavyasa also speaks as\nfollows: 'Formerly the great _ri_ shis, being allowed to do so by Svayambhu,\nobtained, through their penance, the Vedas together with the itihasas, which\nhad been hidden at the end of the yuga.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 30](sbe34099.htm)\n\n"
