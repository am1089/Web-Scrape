It is divided into three species, called respectively Nish _th_ ura, A _s_ lila, and Tivra. The punishment for each increases in severity according as the insult is of a more (or less) serious nature.\n\n* 3. 3 Abuse combined with reproaches has to be regarded as Nish _th_ ura; abuse couched in insulting language is A _s_ lila; charging one with an offence causing expulsion from caste is called Tivra by the learned.\n\n* 4. Hurting the limbs of another person with a hand, foot, weapon or otherwise, or defiling him\n\np. 208\n\nwith ashes or other (impure substances), is termed Assault.\n\n* 5. There are three species of that also, as it may be either light, or of a middling sort, or heavy, according as it consists in the raising (of a hand or weapon for the purpose of striking a blow), or in an unexpected attack, or in striking a wound.\n\n* 6. 6 Stealing articles of small, middling, or superior value, is called the three kinds of Sahasa; there the thorny weeds (sinners) should be extirpated.\n\n* 7. 7 In both kinds (of insult) five cases are distinguished, when the respective innocence or guilt of the two parties has to be established.\n\n* 8. 8 When two parties have been guilty of insult, and both have commenced to quarrel at the same time, they shall suffer the same punishment, in case that no difference (in their respective culpability) becomes apparent.\n\n* 9. He who is the first to offer an insult is decidedly criminal; he who returns the insult is likewise culpable; but the one who began shall suffer the heavier punishment (of the two).\n\np. 209\n\n* 10. When both parties are implicated equally, he of the two shall receive punishment who follows up his attack, whether he was (originally) the aggressor or the defendant.\n\n* 11. 11 If a _S_ vapaka, Meda, _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala, cripple, one who gains his substance by killing (animals), an elephant-driver, one deprived of his caste for nonperformance of the ceremony of initiation, a slave, or one who treats a Guru or spiritual teacher with disregard,\n\n* 12. 12 Should offend a superior, he shall be punished by whipping him on the spot. Nor do the sages regard bodily injury done to a man of this stamp as (an offence equal to) theft.\n\n* 13. Should any such low person, abhorred by men, insult another man (his superior), that man himself shall punish him. The king has nothing to do with the penalty (to be inflicted on him).\n\n* 14. For these people are the refuse of human society, and their property is (likewise) impure. The king also is at liberty to whip them, but he must not amerce them with a fine.\n\n15. 15 A Kshatriya who reviles a Brahman must\n\np. 210\n\npay one hundred (Pa _n_ as) as a fine. A Vai _s_ ya (must pay) one and a half\nhundred, or two hundred. A _S_ udra deserves corporal punishment.\n\n16\\. A Brahman shall be fined fifty (Pa _n_ as) for calumniating a Kshatriya;\nin the case of a Vai _s_ ya, the fine shall be half of fifty (i.e. twenty-\nfive); in the case of a _S_ udra, (it shall amount to) twelve (Pa _n_ as).\n\n17. 17 When a twice-born man offends against a member of his own caste, (he shall pay) twelve (Pa _n_ as as a fine). When he utters calumnies which ought never to be uttered, the fine shall be twice as high.\n\n18. 18 Even he who in accordance with fact (contemptuously) calls another man one-eyed, lame, or the like (names), shall be fined by the king not less than one Karshapa _n_ a.\n\n19\\. One must not tax with his offence a man who has done penance according to\nlaw, or who has received due punishment from the king. By transgressing this\nrule one becomes liable to punishment.\n\n20\\. Two persons, a Brahman and a king, are declared to be exempt from censure\nand corporal punishment in this world; for these two sustain the visible\nworld.\n\n* 21. One who calls an outcast an outcast, or a thief a thief, is equally criminal with those whom he taxes (with their offence). (If he reproaches them) without reason, he is twice as guilty as they are.\n\np. 211\n\n22. 22 A once-born man (or _S_ udra), who insults members of a twice-born caste with gross invectives, shall have his tongue cut out; for he is of low origin.\n\n23. 23 If he refers to their name or caste in terms indicating contempt, an iron rod, ten A\xe1\xb9\x85gulas long, shall be thrust red-hot into his mouth.\n\n24. 24 If he is insolent enough to give lessons regarding their duty to Brahmans, the king shall order hot oil to be poured into his mouth and ears.\n\n* 25. 25 With whatever limb a man of low caste offends against a Brahman, that very limb of his shall be cut off; such shall be the atonement for his crime.\n\n26. 26 A low-born man, who tries to place himself on the same seat with his superior in caste, shall be branded on his hip and banished, or (the king) shall cause his backside to be gashed.\n\n27\\. If through arrogance he spits (on a superior), the king shall cause both\nhis lips to be cut off; if he makes water (on him), the penis; if he breaks\nwind (against him), the buttocks.\n\n28. 28 If he pulls (a superior) by the hair, (the king) shall unhesitatingly cause his hands to be cut off, likewise (if he seizes him) by the feet, beard, neck, or scrotum.\n\n29. 29 If a man breaks the skin (of his equal) or\n\np. 212\n\nfetches blood (from him), he shall be fined a hundred (Pa _n_ as); if he cuts\nthe flesh, six Nishkas; if he breaks a bone, he shall be banished.\n\n* 30. If a man censures a king devoted to the discharge of his duties, he shall have his tongue cut out or his entire property confiscated, as an atonement for such crime.\n\n* 31. When an evil-minded man assails a wicked king even, he shall be (fastened) on a stake and burnt in fire; (for he is) more criminal than one who has committed a hundred times the crime of killing a Brahman.\n\n* 32. A father is not liable to be punished for an offence committed by his son; nor is the owner of a horse, dog, or monkey (responsible for any damage caused by one of these animals), unless he should have set them to do it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[207:1](sbe3347.htm#fr_622) XV, XVI, 1. Thus, e.g. when a man says, 'The Gau\n_d_ as (Bengalis) are quarrelsome,' he abuses another man's native country.\nWhen a man says, 'Brahmans are very avaricious,' he abuses another man's\ncaste. When he says, 'The Vi _s_ vamitras are a ferocious race,' he abuses\nanother man's family. The clause 'and so forth' is added, in order to include\nabusive speeches levelled against learned men, artizans, or the like persons,\nwhose learning or art has been abused. 'Violent terms,' i.e. terms which ought\nnever to be used. Mitakshara, p. 285; Viramitrodaya, p. 482.\n\n[207:3](sbe3347.htm#fr_623) 'Abuse combined with reproaches' is when e.g. a\nman says, 'What a fool,' or 'What a rascal.' 'Abuse couched in insulting\nlanguage' is when a man says, 'I will visit your sister,' or the like.\n'Charging one with a mortal sin causing expulsion from caste,' such as e.g.\nthe drinking of spirituous liquor. See loc. cit.\n\n[208:6](sbe3347.htm#fr_624) The above translation of this paragraph follows\nthe reading of the MSS. If that reading be correct, this paragraph contains a\nrule relating to the subject of theft or Sahasa. The quotations have a\ndifferent reading, under which this paragraph has to be closely connected with\nthe preceding one, and has to be referred equally to the three degrees of\nassault.\n\n[208:7](sbe3347.htm#fr_625) The Nepalese MS. and the commentaries insert the\nfollowing paragraph here: * 'When an insult has occurred between two men\nengaged in a violent quarrel, he who suffers the insult patiently is struck,\nbut the offender is punishable.'\n\n[208:8](sbe3347.htm#fr_626) 8-10. The one who has first commenced a quarrel\nshall receive the heavier punishment of the two. That man is liable to\npunishment who persists in hostility. When it is impossible to ascertain any\np. 209 difference in the culpability of the two parties, their punishment\nshall be equal. Viramitrodaya, p. 472. Read purvam.\n\n[209:11](sbe3347.htm#fr_627) _S_ vapaka, literally 'dog-cooking,' is the name\nof a particular degraded tribe, whose only office is to act as public\nexecutioners. Meda is the name of another mixed caste. _K_ a _n_ _d_ alas are\nthe lowest caste of all, see XII, 113. The Nepalese MS. and the commentaries\nread sha _n_ _dh_ a, 'a eunuch,' instead of Meda.\n\n[209:12](sbe3347.htm#fr_628) 12-14. When a _S_ vapaka or the like should have\ninsulted an \xc3\x82rya or member of the three higher castes, honourable men shall be\nentitled to punish them in person. When the (honourable men) are unable to do\nso, the king shall punish them; but he must not confiscate their property.\nViramitrodaya, p. 472.\n\n[209:15](sbe3347.htm#fr_629) 15-17. Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 267-269.\n\n[210:17](sbe3347.htm#fr_630) According to the commentators of Manu, the term\n'calumnies which ought never to be uttered' has to be referred to insinuations\nagainst the honour of a man's mother, sisters, or other female relatives. See\nProfessor Buhler's note on Manu VIII, 269.\n\n[210:18](sbe3347.htm#fr_631) Manu VIII, 274; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 204.\n\n[211:22](sbe3347.htm#fr_632) 'He is of low origin,' because the _S_ udra caste\nhas been produced from Brahman's feet. Identical with Manu VIII, 270.\n\n[211:23](sbe3347.htm#fr_633) Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 271.\n\n[211:24](sbe3347.htm#fr_634) Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 272.\n\n[211:25](sbe3347.htm#fr_635) Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 279.\n\n[211:26](sbe3347.htm#fr_636) 26, 27. Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 281,\n282. In paragraph 27 the Nepalese MS. has 'the nose' instead of 'the beard.'\n\n[211:28](sbe3347.htm#fr_637) Identical with Manu VIII, 283.\n\n[211:29](sbe3347.htm#fr_638) According to the majority of the commentators of\nManu, p. 212 this rule has reference to an equal in caste. Nearly identical\nwith Manu VIII, 284.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Seventeenth Title of Law. Games](sbe3348.htm)\n\n"
