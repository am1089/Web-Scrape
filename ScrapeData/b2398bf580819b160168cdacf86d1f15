This follows also from the connexion (of the stories with the vidyas) in\none coherent whole.\n\nAnd as thus the stories do not subserve the pariplava it\n\np. 306\n\nis appropriate to assume that they are meant to bring nearer to our\nunderstanding the approximate vidyas with which they are seen to form\nconnected wholes; for they serve to render the latter more acceptable and\nfacilitate their comprehension.\n\nIn the Maitreyi-brahma _n_ a we see that the story forms a whole with the\nvidya beginning, 'The Self indeed is to be seen,' &c.; in the account of\nPratardana with the vidya, 'I am pra _n_ a, the conscious Self;' in the legend\nof _G_ ana _s_ ruti with the vidya, 'Air indeed is the end of all.' The case\nof all these stories is analogous to that of stories met with in scriptural\ntexts referring to works, whose purpose is the glorification of injunctions\nstanding in proximity; as e.g. 'He cut out his own omentum.'--The stories\nunder discussion therefore do not subserve the pariplava.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 25](sbe38234.htm)\n\n"
