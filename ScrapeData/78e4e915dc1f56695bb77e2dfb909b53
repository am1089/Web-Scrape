It was a battle of\nnations, for all warlike races in Northern India took a share in it.\n\nDuryodhan\'s army consisted of his own division, as well as the divisions of\nten allied kings. Each allied power is said to have brought one _akshauhini_\ntroops, and if we reduce this fabulous number to the moderate figure of ten\nthousand, including horse and foot, cars and elephants, Duryodhan\'s army\nincluding his own division was over a hundred thousand strong.\n\nYudhishthir had a smaller army, said to have been seven akshauhinis in number,\nwhich we may by a similar reduction reckon to be seventy thousand. His father-\nin-law the king of the Panchalas, and Arjun\'s relative the king of the\nMatsyas, were his principal allies. Krishna joined him as his friend and\nadviser, and as the charioteer of Arjun, but the Vrishnis as a nation had\njoined Duryodhan.\n\nWhen the two armies were drawn up in array and faced each other, and Arjun saw\nhis revered elders and dear friends and relations among his foes, he was\nunwilling to fight. It was on this occasion that Krishna explained to him the\ngreat principles of Duty in that memorable work called the _Bhagavat-gita_\nwhich has been translated into so many European languages. Belief in one\nSupreme Deity is the underlying thought of this work, and ever and anon, as\nProfessor Garbe remarks, "does Krishna revert to the doctrine that for every\nman, no matter to what caste he may belong, the zealous performance of his\nduty and the discharge of his obligations is his most important work."\n\nDuryodhan chose the grand old fighter Bhishma as the commander-in-chief of his\narmy, and for ten days Bhishma held his own and inflicted serious loss on\nYudhishthir\'s army. The principal incidents of these ten days, ending with the\nfall of Bhishma, are narrated in this Book.\n\nThis Book is an abridgment of Book vi. of the original text.\n\n## I\n\n## PANDAVS ROUTED BY BHISHMA\n\nUshas with her crimson fingers oped the portals of the day,  \nNations armed for mortal combat in the field of battle lay,\n\nBeat of drum and blare of trumpet and the sankha\'s lofty sound,  \nBy the answering cloud repeated, shook the hills and tented ground,\n\nAnd the voice of sounding weapons which the warlike archers drew,  \nAnd the neigh of battle chargers as the armed horsemen flew,\n\nMingled with the rolling thunder of each swiftly-speeding car,  \nAnd with pealing bells proclaiming mighty elephants of war!\n\nBhishma led the Kuru forces, strong as Death\'s resistless flail,  \nHuman chiefs nor bright Immortals could against his might prevail,\n\nHelmet-wearing, gallant Arjun came in pride and mighty wrath,  \nHeld aloft his famed _Gandiva_ , strove to cross the chieftain\'s path!\n\nAbhimanyu son of Arjun, whom the fair Subhadra bore,  \nDrove against Kosala\'s monarch famed in arms and holy lore,\n\nHurling down Kosala\'s standard he the dubious combat won,  \nBarely escaped with life the monarch from the fiery Arjun\'s son!\n\nWith his fated. foe Duryodhan, Bhima strove in deathful war,  \nAnd against the proud Duhsasan brave Nakula drove his car,\n\nSahadeva mighty bowman, then the fierce Durmukha sought,  \nAnd the righteous king Yudhishthir with the car-borne Salya fought,\n\nAncient feud and deathless hatred fired the Brahman warrior bold,  \nDrona with the proud Panchalas fought once more his feud of old!\n\nNations from the Eastern regions \'gainst the bold Virata pressed,  \nKripa met the wild Kaikeyas hailing from the furthest West,\n\nDrupad proud and peerless monarch with his cohorts onward bore  \n\'Gainst the warlike Jayadratha chief of Sindhu\'s sounding shore,\n\nChedis and the valiant Matsyas, nations gathered from afar,  \nBhojas and the fierce Kambojas mingled in the dubious war!\n\nThrough the day the battle lasted, and no mortal tongue can tell  \nWhat unnumbered chieftains perished and what countless soldiers fell.\n\nAnd the son knew not his father, and the sire knew not his son,  \nBrother fought against his brother, strange the deeds of valour done!\n\nHorses fell, and shafts of chariots shivered in resistless shock,  \nHurled against the foreman\'s chariots speeding like the rolling rock,\n\nElephants by mahuts driven furiously each other tore,  \nTrumpeting with trunks uplifted on the serried soldiers bore!\n\nCeaseless plied the gallant troopers, with a stern unyielding might,  \nPikes and axes, clubs and maces, swords and spears and lances bright,\n\nHorsemen flew as forked lightning, heroes fought in shining mail,  \nArchers poured their feathered arrows like the bright and glistening hail!\n\nBhishma leader of the Kurus, as declined the dreadful day,  \nThrough the shattered Pandav legions forced his all-resistless way,\n\nOnward went his palm-tree standard through the hostile ranks of war,  \nMatsyas, Kasis, nor Panchalas faced the mighty Bhishma\'s car!\n\nBut the fiery son of Arjun, filled with shame and bitter wrath,  \nTurned his car and tawny coursers to obstruct the chieftain\'s path,\n\nVainly fought the youthful warrior though his darts were pointed well,  \nAnd dissevered from his chariot Bhishma\'s palm-tree standard fell,\n\nAnger stirred the ancient Bhishma and he rose in all his might,  \nAbhimanyu pierced with arrows fell and fainted in the fight!\n\nThen to save the son of Arjun, Matsya\'s gallant princes came,  \nBrave Uttara, noble Sweta, youthful warriors known to fame,\n\nAh! too early fell the warriors in that sad and fatal strife,  \nMatsya\'s dames and dark-eyed maidens wept the princes\' shortened life!\n\nSlain by cruel fate untimely fell two brothers young and good,  \nDauntless still the youngest brother, proud and gallant Sankha stood,\n\nBut the helmet-wearing Arjun came to stop the victor\'s path,  \nAnd to save the fearless Sankha from the ancient Bhishma\'s wrath,\n\nDrupad too, Panchala\'s monarch, swiftly rushed into the fray,  \nStrove to shield the broken Pandavs and to stop the victor\'s way.\n\nBut as fire consumes the forest, wrathful Bhishma slew the foe,  \nNone could face his sounding chariot and his ever-circled bow,\n\nAnd the fainting Pandav warriors marked the foe, resistless, bold,  \nShook like unprotected cattle tethered in the blighting cold!\n\nOnward came the mighty Bhishma and the slaughter fiercer grew  \nFrom his bow like hissing serpents still the glistening arrows flew,\n\nOnward came the ancient warrior and his path was strewn with dead,  \nAnd the broken Pandav forces, crushed and driven, scattered fled,\n\nFriendly night and gathering darkness closed the slaughter of the day,  \nTo their tents the sons of Pandu held their sad and weary way!\n\n## II\n\n## KURUS ROUTED BY ARJUN\n\nGrieved at heart the good Yudhishthir wept the losses of the day,  \nSought the aid of gallant Krishna for the morning\'s fresh array,\n\nAnd when from the eastern mountains SURYA drove his fiery car,  \nBhishma and the helmed Arjun strove to turn the tide of war.\n\nBhishma\'s glorious palm-tree standard o\'er the field of battle rose,  \nArjun\'s monkey-standard glittered cleaving through the serried foes,\n\nDevas from their cloud-borne chariots, and _Gandharvas_ from the sky,  \nGazed in mute and speechless wonder on the human chiefs from high!\n\nWhile with dauntless valour Arjun still the mighty Bhishma sought,  \nWarlike prince of fair Panchala with the doughty Drona fought,\n\nCeaseless \'gainst the proud preceptor sent his darts like summer rain,  \nBaffled by the skill of Drona, Dhrista-dyumna strove in vain!\n\nBut the fiercer darts of Drona pierced the prince\'s shattered mail,  \nHurtling on his battle chariot like an angry shower of hail,\n\nAnd they rent in twain his bowstring and they cut his pond\'rous mace,  \nSlew his steeds and chariot-driver, streaked with blood his godlike face.\n\nDauntless still Panchala\'s hero, springing from his shattered car,  \nLike a hungry desert lion with his sabre rushed to war,\n\nDashed aside the darts of Drona with his broad and ample shield,  \nWith his sabre brightly flaming fearless trod the reddened field!\n\nIn his fury and his rashness he had fallen on that day,  \nBut the ever-watchful Bhima stopped the proud preceptor\'s way,\n\nProud Duryodhan marked with anger Bhima rushing in his car,  \nAnd he sent Kalinga\'s forces to the thickening ranks of war.\n\nOnward came Kalinga\'s forces with the dark tornado\'s might,  \nDusky chiefs, Nishada warriors, gloomy as the sable night,\n\nRose the shout of warring nations surging to the battle\'s fore,  \nLike the angry voice of tempest and the ocean\'s troubled roar,\n\nAnd like darkly rolling breakers ranks of serried warriors flew,  \nScarcely in the thickening darkness friends and kin from foemen knew!\n\nFell the young prince of Kalinga by the wrathful Bhima slain,  \nBut against Kalinga\'s monarch baffled Bhima fought in vain,\n\nSafely sat the eastern monarch on his _howda\'s_ lofty seat,  \nTill upon the giant tusker Bhima sprang with agile feet,\n\nThen he struck with fatal fury, brave Kalinga fell in twain,  \nScattered fled his countless forces when they saw their leader slain!\n\nDarkly rolled the tide of battle where Duryodhan\'s valiant son  \nStrove against the son of Arjun famed for deeds of valour done,\n\nProud Duryodhan marked the contest with a father\'s anxious heart,  \nCame to save his gallant Lakshman from brave Abhimanyu\'s dart,\n\nAnd the helmet-wearing Arjun marked his son among his foes,  \nWheeled from far his battle-chariot and in wrath terrific rose!\n\n"Arjun!" "Arjun!" cried the Kurus, and in panic broke and fled,  \nSteed and tusker turned from battle, soldiers fell among the dead,\n\nGodlike Krishna drove the coursers of resistless Arjun\'s car,  \nAnd the sound of Arjun\'s _sankha_ rose above the cry of war,\n\nAnd the voice of his _Gandiva_ spread a terror far and near,  \nCrushed and broken, faint and frightened, fled the Kurus in their fear,\n\nOnward still through scattered foemen conquering Arjun held his way,  \nTill the evening\'s gathering darkness closed the action of the day!\n\n## III\n\n## BHISHMA AND ARJUN MEET\n\nAnxious was the proud Duryodhan when the golden morning came,  \nFor before the car of Arjun fled each Kuru chief of fame,\n\nBrave Duryodhan shook in anger and a tremor moved his frame  \nAs he spake to ancient Bhishma words of wrath in bitter shame:\n\n"Bhishma! dost thou lead the Kurus in this battle\'s crimson field,  \nWarlike Drona, doth he guard us like a broad and ample shield?\n\nWherefore then before yon Arjun do the valiant Kurus fly,  \nWherefore doth our leader linger when he hears the battle cry?\n\nDoth a secret love for Pandavs quell our leader\'s matchless might,  \nWith a halting zeal for Kurus doth the noble Bhishma fight?\n\nPardon, chief, if for the Pandavs doth thy partial heart incline,  \nYield thy place, let faithful Karna lead my gallant Kuru line!\n\nAnger flamed on Bhishma\'s forehead and the tear was in his eye,  \nAnd in accents few and trembling thus the warrior made reply:\n\n"Vain our toil, unwise Duryodhan! Nor can Bhishma warrior old,  \nNor can Drona skilled in weapons, Karna archer proud and bold,\n\nWash the stain of deeds unholy and of wrongs and outraged laws,  \nConquer with a load of cunning \'gainst a right and righteous cause,\n\nDeaf to wisdom\'s voice, Duryodhan, deaf to parents and to kin,  \nThou shalt perish in thy folly, in thy unrepented sin!\n\nFor the wrongs and insults offered unto good Yudhishthir\'s wife,  \nFor the kingdom from him stolen, for the plots against his life,\n\nFor the dreadful oath of Bhima, for the holy counsel given,  \nVainly given by saintly Krishna, thou art doomed by righteous Heaven!\n\nMeanwhile since he leads thy forces, Bhishma still shall meet his foe,  \nOr to conquer or to perish to the battle\'s front I go."\n\nSpeaking thus, unto the battle ancient Bhishma held his way,  \nSweeping all before his chariot as he swept them day by day,\n\nAnd the army of Yudhishthir shook from end to farthest end,  \nArjun nor the valiant Krishna could against the tide contend!\n\nCars were shattered, fled the coursers, elephants were pierced and slain.  \nShafts of chariots, broken standards, lifeless soldiers strewed the plain,\n\nCoats of mail were left by warriors as they ran with streaming hair,  \nSoldiers fled like herds of cattle stricken by a sudden fear!\n\nKrishna, Arjun\'s chariot-driver, and a chief of righteous fame,  \nMarked the broken Pandav forces, spake in grief and bitter shame:\n\n"Arjun! not in hour of battle hath it been they wont to fly,  \nForward lay thy path of glory, or to conquer or to die!\n\nIf to-day with angry Bhishma, Arjun shuns the dubious fight,  \nShame on Krishna! if he joins thee in this sad inglorious flight,\n\nBe it mine alone, O Arjun! warrior\'s wonted work to know,  \nKrishna with his fiery discus smites the all-resistless foe!"\n\nThen he flung the reins to Arjun, left the steeds and sounding car,  \nLeaped upon the field of battle, rushed into the dreadful war,\n\n"Shame!" cried Arjun in his anger, "Krishna shall not wage the fight,  \nNor shall Arjun like a recreant seek for safety in his flight!"\n\nAnd he dashed behind the warrior and on foot the chief pursued,  \nCaught him as the angry Krishna still his distant foeman viewed,\n\nStalwart Arjun lifted Krishna, as the storm lifts up a tree,  \nPlaced him on his battle-chariot and he bent to him his knee:\n\n"Pardon, Krishna, this compulsion, pardon this transgression bold,  \nBut while Arjun lives, O chieftain! weapon of thy wrath withhold!\n\nBy my warlike Abhimanyu, fair Subhadra\'s darling boy,  \nBy my brothers, dearer, truer, than in hours of pride and joy,\n\nBy my troth I pledge thee, Krishna,--let thy angry discus sleep,--  \nArcher Arjun meets his foeman, and his plighted word will keep."\n\nForthwith rushed the fiery Arjun in his sounding battle-car,  \nAnd like waves before him parted serried ranks of hostile war,\n\nVainly hurled his lance Duryodhan \'gainst the valiant warrior\'s face,  \nVainly Salya, king of Madra, threw with skill his pond\'rous mace,\n\nWith disdain the godlike Arjun dashed the feeble darts aside,  \nHold aloft his famed _Gandiva_ as he stood with haughty pride,\n\nBeat of drum and blare of _sankha_ and the thunder of his car,  \nAnd his weapon\'s fearful accents rose terrific near and far!\n\nCame resistless Pandav forces, sweeping onward wave on wave,  \nChedis, Matsyas, and Panchalas, chieftains true and warriors brave,\n\nOnward too came forth the Kurus by the matchless Bhishma led,  \nShouts arose and cry of anguish midst the dying and the dead,\n\nBut the evening closed in darkness and the night-fires fitful flared,  \nFainting troops and bleeding chieftains to their various tents repaired!\n\n## IV\n\n## DURYODHAN\'S EIGHT BROTHERS SLAIN\n\nDawned another day of battle; Kurus knew that day too well,  \nWidowed queens of fair Hastina wept before the evening fell,\n\nFor as whirlwind of destruction Bhima swept in mighty wrath,  \nBroke the serried line of tuskers vainly sent to cross his path,\n\nSmote Duryodhan with his arrows, three terrific darts and five,  \nSmote proud Salya; from the battle scarce they bore the chiefs alive!\n\nThen Duryodhan\'s fourteen brothers rushed into the dreadful fray,  \nFatal was the luckless moment, inauspicious was the day,\n\nLicked his mouth the vengeful Bhima, and he shook his bow and lance,  \nAs the lion lolls his red tongue when he see his prey advance,\n\nShort and fierce the furious combat; six pale princes turned and fled,  \nEight of proud Duryodhan\'s brothers f ell and slumbered with the dead!\n\n## V\n\n## SATYAKI\'S SONS SLAIN\n\nMorning with her fiery radiance oped the portals of the day,  \nShone once more on Kuru warriors, Pandav chiefs in dread array,\n\nBhima and the gallant Arjun. led once more the van of war,  \nBut the proud preceptor Drona faced them in his sounding car!\n\nStill with gallant son of Arjun, Lakshman strove with bow and shield,  \nVainly strove; his faithful henchman bore him bleeding from the field,\n\nLakshman son of proud Duryodhan, Abhimanyu Arjun\'s son,  \nDoomed to die in youth and glory \'neath the same revolving sun!\n\nSad the day for Vrishni warriors! Brave Satyaki\'s sons of might  \n\'Gainst the cruel Bhuri-sravas strove in unrelenting fight,\n\nTen brave brothers, pride of Vrishni, fell upon that fatal day,  \nSlain by mighty Bhuri-sravas on the battle\'s red field lay!\n\n## VI\n\n## BHIMA\'S DANGER AND RESCUE\n\nDawned another day of slaughter; heedless Bhima forced his way  \nThrough Duryodhan\'s serried legions, where dark death and danger lay,\n\nAnd a hundred foemen gathered and unequal was the strife,  \nBhima strove with furious valour, for his forfeit was his life!\n\nFair Panchala\'s watchful monarch saw the danger from afar,  \nForced his way where bleeding Bhima fought beside his shattered car,\n\nAnd he helped the fainting warrior, placed him on his chariot-seat,  \nBut the Kurus darkly gathered, surging round as waters meet!\n\nArjun\'s son and twelve brave chieftains dashed into the dubious fray,  \nRescued Bhima and proud Drupad from the Kurus\' grim array,\n\nSurging still the Kuru forces onward came with ceaseless might,  \nDrona smote the scattered Pandavs till the darksome hours of night!\n\n## VII\n\n## PANDAVS ROUTED BY BHISHMA\n\nMorning came and angry Arjun rushed into the dreadful war,  \nKrishna drove his milk-white coursers, onward flew his sounding car,\n\nAnd before his monkey banner quailed the faint and frightened foes,  \nTill like star on billowy ocean Bhishma\'s palm-tree banner rose!\n\nVainly then the good Yudhishthir, stalwart Bhima, Arjun brave,  \nStrove with useless toil and valour shattered ranks of war to save,\n\nVainly too the Pandav brothers on the peerless Bhishma fell,  \nGods in sky nor earthly warriors Bhishma\'s matchless might could quell!\n\nFell Yudhishthir\'s lofty standard, shook his chariot battle-tost,  \nFell his proud and fiery coursers, and the dreadful day was lost,\n\nSahadeva and Nakula vainly strove with all their might,  \nTill their broken scattered forces rested in the shades of night!\n\n## VIII\n\n## IRAVAT SLAIN\n\nMorning saw the turn of battle; Bhishma\'s charioteer was slain,  \nAnd his coursers uncontrolled flew across the reddened plain,\n\nIll it fared with Kuru forces when their leader went astray,  \nAnd their foremost chiefs and warriors with the dead and dying lay.\n\nBut Gandhara\'s mounted princes rode across the battle-ground,  \nFor its steeds and matchless chargers is Gandhara\'s realm renowned,\n\nAnd to smite the young Iravat fierce Gandhara\'s princes swore,  \nBrave Iravat son of Arjun, whom a Naga, princess bore!\n\nMounted on their milk-white chargers proudly did the princes sweep,  \nLike the sea-birds skimming gaily o\'er the bosom of the deep,\n\nFive of stout Gandhara\'s princes in that fatal combat fell,  \nAnd a sixth in fear and faintness fled the woeful tale to tell!\n\nShort, alas, Iravat\'s triumph, transient was the victor\'s joy,  \nAlumbusha dark and dreadful came against the gallant boy,\n\nFierce and fateful was the combat, mournful is the tale to tell,  \nLike a lotus rudely severed gallant son of Arjun fell!\n\nArjun heard the tale of sorrow and his heart was filled with grief,  \nAnd he spake a father\'s anguish in his accents few and brief:\n\n"Wherefore, Krishna, for a kingdom mingle in this fatal fray,  \nKinsmen killed and comrades slaughtered,-dear, alas, the price we pay!\n\nWoe unto Hastina\'s empire built upon our children\'s grave,  \nDearer than the throne of monarchs was Iravat young and brave,\n\nYoung in years and rich in beauty, with thy mother\'s winsome eye,  \nArt thou slain, my gallant warrior, and thy father was not nigh?\n\nBut thy young blood calls for vengeance! noble Krishna, drive the car,  \nLet them feel the father\'s prowess, those who slew the son in war!"\n\nAnd he dashed the rising tear-drop and his words were few and brief,  \nBroken ranks and slaughtered chieftains spoke an angry father\'s grief,\n\nBhima too revenged Iravat, and as onward still he flew,  \nBrothers of the proud Duryodhan in that fatal combat slew,\n\nStill advanced the fatal carnage till the darksome close of day,  \nWhen the wounded and the weary with the dead and lying lay!\n\n## IX\n\n## PANDAVS ROUTED BY BHISHMA\n\nFell the thickening shades of darkness on the red and ghastly plain,  \nTorches by the white tents flickered, red fires showed the countless slain,\n\nWith a bosom sorrow-laden proud Duryodhan drew his breath,  \nWept the issue of the battle and his warlike brother\'s death.\n\nSpent with grief and silent sorrow slow the Kuru monarch went  \nWhere arose in dewy starlight Bhishma\'s proud and snowy tent,\n\nAnd with tears and soft entreaty thus the sad Duryodhan spoke,  \nAnd his mournful bitter accents oft by heaving sighs were broke:\n\n"Bhishma! on thy matchless prowess Kuru\'s hopes and fates depend,  \nGods nor men with warlike Bhishma can in field of war contend,\n\nBrave in war are sons of Pandu, but they face not Bhishma\'s might,  \nIn their fierce and deathless hatred slay my brothers in the fight!\n\nMind thy pledge, O chief of Kurus, save Hastina\'s royal race,  \nOn the ancient king my father grant thy never-failing grace,\n\nIf within thy noble bosom,--pardon cruel words I say,--  \nSecret love for sons of Pandu holds a soft and partial sway,\n\nIf thy inner heart\'s affection unto Pandu\'s sons incline,  \nGrant that Karna lead my forces \'gainst the foeman\'s hostile line!"\n\nBhishma\'s heart was full of sadness and his eyelids dropped a tear,  \nSoft and mournful were his accents and his vision true and clear:\n\n"Vain, Duryodhan, is this contest, and thy mighty host is vain,  \nWhy with blood of friendly nations drench this red and reeking plain?\n\nThey must win who, strong in virtue, fight for virtue\'s stainless laws,  \nDoubly armed the stalwart warrior who is armed in righteous cause,\n\nThink, Duryodhan, when _Gandharvas_ took thee captive and a slave,  \nDid not Arjun rend thy fetters, Arjun righteous chief and brave,\n\nWhen in Matsya\'s fields of pasture captured we Virata\'s kine,  \nDid not Arjun in his valour beat thy countless force and mine?\n\nKrishna now hath come to Arjun, Krishna drives his battle-car,  \nGods nor men can face these heroes in the field of righteous war,\n\nRuin frowns on thee, Duryodhan, and upon thy impious State,  \nIn thy pride and in thy folly thou hast courted cruel fate,\n\nBhishma still will do his duty, and his end it is not far,  \nThen may other chieftains follow,-fatal is this Kuru war!\n\nDawned a day of mighty slaughter and of dread and deathful war,  \nAncient Bhishma, in his anger drove once more his sounding car,\n\nMorn to noon and noon to evening none could f ace the victor\'s wrath,  \nBroke and shattered, faint and frightened, Pandavs fled before his path,\n\nStill amidst the dead and dying moved his proud resistless car,  \nTill the gathering night and darkness closed the horrors of the war!\n\n## X\n\n## FALL OF BHISHMA\n\nGood Yudhishthir gazed with sorrow on the dark and ghastly plain,  \nShed his tears on chiefs and warriors by the matchless Bhishma slain:\n\n"Vain this unavailing battle, vain this woeful loss of life,  \n\'Gainst the death-compelling Bhishma hopeless in this arduous strife!\n\nAs a lordly tusker tramples on a marsh of feeble reeds,  \nAs a forest conflagration on the parched woodland feeds,\n\nBhishma tramples on my forces in his mighty battle-car,  \nGod nor mortal chief can face him in the gory field of war!\n\nVain our toil and vain the valour of our kinsmen loved and lost,  \nVainly fight my faithful brothers by a luckless fortune crost,\n\nNations pour their lifeblood vainly, ceaseless wakes the sound of woe,  \nKrishna, stop this cruel carnage, unto woods once more we go!"\n\nSad they held a midnight council and the chiefs in silence met,  \nAnd they went to ancient Bhishma, love and mercy to entreat,\n\nBhishma loved the sons of Pandu with a father\'s loving heart,  \nBut from troth unto Duryodhan righteous Bhishma would not part!\n\n"Sons of Pandu!" said the chieftain, "Prince Duryodhan is my lord,  \nBhishma is no faithless servant nor will break his plighted word,\n\nValiant are ye, noble princes, but the chief is yet unborn,  \nWhile I lead the course of battle, who the tide of war can turn!\n\nListen more. With vanquished foeman, or who falls or takes to fight,  \nCasts his weapons, craves for mercy, ancient Bhishma doth not fight,\n\nBhishma doth not fight a rival who submits, fatigued and worn,  \nBhishma doth not fight the wounded, doth not fight a woman born!"\n\nBack unto their tents the Pandavs turn with Krishna deep and wise,  \nHe unto the anxious Arjun thus in solemn whisper cries:\n\n"Arjun, there is hope of triumph! Hath not truthful Bhishma sworn  \nHe will fight no wounded warrior, he will fight no woman born?\n\nFemale child was brave Sikhandin, Drupad\'s youngest son of pride,  \nGods have turned him to a warrior, placed. him by Yudhishthir\'s side,\n\nPlace him in the van of battle, mighty Bhishma. leaves the strife,  \nThen with ease we fight and conquer, and the forfeit is his life!"\n\n"Shame!" exclaimed the angry Arjun, "not in secret heroes fight,  \nNot behind a child or woman screen their valour and their might,\n\nKrishna, loth is archer Arjun to pursue this hateful strife,  \nTrick against the sinless Bhishma, fraud upon his spotless life!\n\nListen, good and noble Krishna; as a child I climbed his knee,  \nAs a boy I called him father, hung upon him lovingly,\n\nPerish conquest dearly purchased by a mean deceitful strife,  \nPerish crown and jewelled sceptre won with Bhishma\'s saintly life!"\n\nGravely answered noble Krishna: "Bhishma falls by close of day,  \nVictim to the cause of virtue, he himself hath showed the way,\n\nDear or hated be the foeman, Arjun, thou shalt fight and slay,  \nWherefore else the blood of nations hast thou poured from day to day?"\n\nMorning dawned, and mighty Arjun, Abhimanyu young and bold,  \nDrupad monarch of Panchala, and Virata stern and old,\n\nBrave Yudhishthir and his brothers clad in arms and shining mail,  \nRushed to war where Bhishma\'s standard gleamed slid glittered ill the gale!\n\nProud Duryodhan marked. their onset and its fatal purpose knew,  \nAnd his bravest men and chieftains \'gainst the fiery Pandavs threw,\n\nWith Kamboja\'s stalwart monarch and with Drona\'s mighty soil,  \nWith the valiant bowman Kripa stemmed the battle still unwon!\n\nAnd his younger, fierce Duhsasan, thirsting for the deathful war,  \n\'Gainst the helmet-wearing Arjun drew his mighty battle-car,\n\nAs the high and rugged mountain meets the angry ocean\'s sway,  \nProud Duhsasan warred with Arjun in his wild and onward way,\n\nAnd as myriad white-winged sea-birds swoop upon the darksome wave,  \nClouds of darts and glistening lances drank the red blood of the brave!\n\nOther warlike Kuru chieftains came, the bravest and the best,  \nDrona\'s self and Bhagadatta monarch of the farthest East,\n\nCar-borne Salya mighty warrior, king of Madra\'s distant land,  \nPrinces from Avanti\'s regions, chiefs from Malwa\'s rocky strand,\n\nJayadratha matchless fighter, king of Sindhu\'s sounding shore,  \nChitrasena and Vikarna, countless chiefs and warriors more!\n\nAnd they faced the fiery Pandavs peerless in their warlike might,  \nLong and dreadful raged the combat, darkly closed the dubious fight,\n\nDust arose like clouds of summer, glistening darts like lightning played,  \nDarksome grew the sky with arrows, thicker grew the gloomy shade,\n\nCars went down and mailed horsemen, soldiers fell in dread array,  \nElephants with white tusks broken and with mangled bodies lay!\n\nArjun and the stalwart Bhima piercing through their countless foes,  \nSide by side impelled their chariots where the palm-tree standard rose,\n\nWhere the peerless ancient Bhishma on that dark and fatal day,  \nWarring with the banded nations still resistless held his way!\n\nOn he came, his palm-tree standard still the front of battle knew,  \nAnd like sun from dark clouds parting Bhishma burst on Arjun\'s view,\n\nAnd his eyes brave Arjun shaded at the awe-inspiring sight,  \nHalf he wished to turn for shelter from that chief of godlike might!\n\nBut bold Krishna drove his chariot, whispered low his fatal plan,  \nArjun placed the young Sikhandin in the deathful battle\'s van,\n\nBhishma viewed the Pandav forces with a calm unmoving face,  \nSaw not Arjun\'s fair _Gandiva_ , saw not Bhima\'s mighty mace,\n\nSmiled to see the young Sikhandin rushing to the battle\'s fore,  \nLike the foam upon the billow when the mighty storm-winds roar!\n\nBhishma thought of word he plighted and of oath that he had sworn,  \nDropped his arms before the warrior who a female child was born,\n\nAnd the standard which no warrior ever saw in base retreat,  \nIdly stood upon the chariot, threw its shade on Bhishma\'s seat,\n\nAnd the flagstaff fell dissevered on the crushed and broken oar,  \nAs from azure sky of midnight falls the meteor\'s flaming star!\n\nNot Sikhandin\'s feeble arrows did the palm-tree standard fell,  \nNot Sikhandin\'s feeble lances did the peerless Bhishma quell,\n\nT\'rue to oath and unresisting, Bhishma turned his face away,  \nTurned and fell; the sun declining marked the closing of the day!\n\nEnded thus the fatal battle, truce came with the close of day,  \nKurus and the silent Pandavs went where Bhishma dying lay,\n\nArjun wept as for a father weeps a sad and sorrowing son,  \nGood Yudhishthir cursed the morning Kuru-kshetra\'s war begun,\n\nStood Duryodhan and his brothers mantled in the gloom of grief,  \nFoes like loving brothers sorrowed round the great the dying chief!\n\nArjun\'s keen and pointed arrows made the hero\'s dying bed,  \nAnd in soft and gentle accents to Duryodhan thus he said:\n\n"List unto my words, Duryodhan, uttered with my latest breath,  \nList to Bhishma\'s dying counsel and revere the voice of death,\n\nEnd this dread and deathful battle if thy stony heart can grieve,  \nSave the chieftains doomed to slaughter, bid the fated nations live.\n\nGrant his kingdom to Yudhishthir righteous man beloved of Heaven  \nKeep thy own Hastina\'s regions, be the hapless past forgiven!\n\nVain, alas, the voice of Bhishma like the voice of angel spoke,  \nHatred dearer than his lifeblood in the proud Duryodhan woke!\n\nDarker grew the gloomy midnight and the princes went their way,  \nOn his bed of pointed arrows Bhishma lone and dying lay,\n\nKarna, though he loved not Bhishma whilst the chieftain lived in fame,  \nGently to the dying Bhishma in the midnight darkness came!\n\nBhishma heard the tread of Karna and he oped his glazing eye,  \nSpake in love and spake in sadness and his bosom heaved a sigh:\n\n"Pride and envy, noble Karna, filled our warlike hearts with strife,  \nDiscord ends with breath departing, envy sinks with fleeting life!\n\nMore I have to tell thee, Karna, but my parting breath may fail,  \nFeeble are my dying accents and my parched lips are pale,\n\nArjun beats not noble Karna in the deeds of valour done,  \nNor excels in birth and lineage, Karna, thou art Pritha\'s son!\n\nPritha bore thee, still unwedded, and the Sun inspired thy birth,  \nGod-born man! No mightier archer treads this broad and spacious earth,\n\nPritha cast thee in her sorrow, hid thee with a maiden\'s shame  \nAnd a driver, not thy father, nursed thee, chief of warlike fame,\n\nArjun is thy brother, Karna, end this sad fraternal war,  \nSeek not lifeblood of thy brother nor against him drive thy car!"\n\nVain, alas, the voice of Bhishma like the voice of angel spoke,  \nHatred dearer than his life blood in the vengeful Karna woke!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book IX: Fall of Drona](maha09.htm)\n\n'
