Charm with an amulet derived from the gangida tree, against diseases\nand demons.\n\n1\\. Unto long life and great delights, for ever unharmed and vigorous, do we\nwear the gangida, as an amulet destructive of the vishkandha.  \n2\\. From convulsions, from tearing pain, from vishkandha, and from torturing\npain, the gangida shall protect us on all sides--an amulet of a thousand\nvirtues!  \n3\\. This gangida conquers the vishkandha, and smites the Atrin (devouring\ndemons); may this all-healing gangida protect us from adversity!  \n4\\. By means of the invigorating gangida, bestowed by the gods as an amulet,\ndo we conquer in battle the vishkandha and all the Rakshas.  \n5\\. May the hemp and may gangida protect me against vishkandha! The one\n(gangida) is brought hither from the forest, the other (hemp) from the sap of\nthe furrow.  \n6\\. Destruction of witchcraft is this amulet, also destruction of hostile\npowers: may the powerful gangida therefore extend far our lives!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIX, 34, Charm with an amulet derived from the gafigpida-tree, aoainst\ndiseases and demons](av056.htm)\n\n'
