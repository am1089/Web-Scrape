b"[Sacred-Texts](../../index.htm) [Hindu](../index.htm) [Index](index.htm)\n\n* * *\n\n## The Sankhya Aphorisms of Kapila\n\n### notes to the hypertext transcription\n\n* * *\n\nIn the original text, the Sanskrit of all of the aphorisms was supplied, and\nthat of many of the commentaries was shown in the notes. All of this was\neliminated, and the footnotes remaining were in many cases edited to\ncircumvent direct reference to the Sanskrit that was removed. Where reference\nto the deleted Sanskrit was deemed unavoidable, it was replaced with the ###\nsymbol.\n\nThere are internal references to other parts of the text throughout, and all\nof these have been linked to allow for ease of navigation. In addition, every\naphorism is preceded by a red asterisk link (i.e.: _*_ ), which is a self-\nreferential anchor. This acts as a temporary bookmark, and by clicking on this\nanchor before following other links, you will be able to use your browser's\nback button to return directly to the aphorism that you were reading (and not\nto the beginning of the file) after following internal links.\n\nThere are several places in the text where it was necessary to add matching\nbrakets, quotation marks, and other punctuation that are missing in the\noriginal; these changes are not marked or otherwise noted. The same is true of\nthe diacritical marks in some of the Indian words and names. Also, there was a\nlist of corrections and additions printed at the end of the book. These have\nall been incorporated into this rescension where they emend the English. Some\nhave been changed without further notice, and others have been added as\nadditional footnotes. Added footnotes are referenced by asterisk instead of\nnumber, but all commentary (excepting that enclosed in braces, i.e.: { }, and\nthe minor emendations mentioned above) was the work of the translator or the\noriginal editor.\n\n* * *\n\n[Index](index.htm)\n\n"
