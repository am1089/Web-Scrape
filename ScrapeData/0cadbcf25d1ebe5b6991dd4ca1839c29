Griffith\n\n### 1895\n\n# PREFACE\n\nThe _Samaveda_ , or Veda of Holy Songs, third in the usual order of\nenumeration of the three Vedas, ranks next in sanctity and liturgical\nimportance to the _Rgveda_ or Veda of Recited praise. Its Sanhita, or metrical\nportion, consists chiefly of hymns to be chanted by the Udgatar priests at the\nperformance of those important sacrifices in which the juice of the Soma\nplant, clarified and mixed with milk and other ingredients, was offered in\nlibation to various deities. The Collection is made up of hymns, portions of\nhymns, and detached verses, taken mainly from the _Rgveda_ , transposed and\nre-arranged, without reference to their original order, to suit the religious\nceremonies in which they were to be employed. In these compiled hymns there\nare frequent variations, of more or less importance, from the text of the\n_Rgveda_ as we now possess it which variations, although in some cases they\nare apparently explanatory, seem in others to be older and more original than\nthe readings of the _Rgveda_. In singing, the verses are still further altered\nby prolongation, repetition and insertion of syllables, and various\nmodulations, rests, and other modifications prescribed, for the guidance of\nthe officiating priests, in the Ganas or Song-books. Two of these manuals, the\nGramageyagdna, or Congregational, and the Aranyagana or Forest Song-Book,\nfollow the order of the verses of part I, of the Sanhita, and two others, the\nUhagana, the Uhyagana, of Part II. This part is less disjointed than part I,\nand is generally arranged in triplets whose first verse is often the\nrepetition of a verse that has occurred in part I.\n\nThere is no clue to the date of the compilation of the _Samaveda Hymns_ , nor\nhas the compiler's name been handed down to us. Such a manual was unnecessary\nin the early times when the Aryans first came into India, but was required for\nguidance and use in the complicated ritual elaborated by the invaders after\ntheir expansion and settlement in their new homes.\n\nThere are three recensions of the text of the _Samaveda Sanhita_ , the\nKauthuma Sakha or recension is current in Guzerat, the Jaiminiya in the\nCarnatic, and the Ranayaniya in the Mahratta country. A translation, by Dr.\nStevenson, of the Ranayaniya recension-or, rather, a free version of Sayana's\nparaphrase-was edited by Professor Wilson, in 1842; in 1848 Professor Benfey\nof Gottingen brought out an excellent edition of the same text with a metrical\ntranslation, a complete glossary, and explanatory notes; and in 1874-78 Pandit\nSatyavrata Samasrami of Calcutta published in the Bibliotheca Indicaa. most\nmeritorious edition of the Sanhita according to the same recension, with\nSayana's commentary, portions of the Song-books, andi other illustrative\nmatter. I have followed Benfey's text, and have, made much use of his glossary\nand notes. Pandit Satyavrata Samasrami's edition also has been of the greatest\nservice to me. To Mr. Venis, Principal of the Benares Sanskrit College, I am\nindebted for, the loan of the College manuscripts of the text and commentary.\n\nI repeat the expression of my obligations to those scholars whose works\nassisted me in my translation of the _Hymns of the Rgveda_. For help in\ntranslating the non-Rgvedic Hymns of the _Samaveda_ , I am additionally\nindebted to the late Professor Benfey and to Professor Ludwig whose version\nwill be found in his _Der Rgveda_ , vol. III, pp. 19-25.\n\nFor further information regarding the _Samaveda_ Weber's _History Of Indian\nLiterature_ , and Max Muller's _History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature_ , or\nthe article on the Veda in _Chamber's Encyclopaedia_ should be consulted.\n\n**\n\nR.T.H.

Om.\n\n#### DECADE I Agni\n\n1\\. Come, Agni, praised with song, to feast and sacrificial offering: sit  \nAs Hotar on the holy grass!  \n2\\. O Agni, thou hast been ordained Hotar of every sacrifice,  \nBy Gods, among the race of men.  \n3\\. Agni we choose as envoy, skilled performer of this holy rite,  \nHotar, possessor of all wealth.  \n4\\. Served with oblation, kindled, bright, through love of song may Agni, bent  \nOn riches, smite the Vritras dead!  \n5\\. I laud your most beloved guest like a dear friend, O Agni, him  \nWho, like a chariot, wins us wealth.  \n6\\. Do thou, O Agni, with great might guard us from all malignity,  \nYea, from the hate of mortal man!  \n7\\. O Agni, come; far other songs of praise will I sing forth to thee.  \nWax mighty with these Soma-drops!  \n8\\. May Vatsa draw thy mind away even from thy loftiest dwelling place!  \nAgni, I yearn for thee with song.  \n9\\. Agni, Atharvan brought thee forth by rubbing from the sky, the head  \nOf all who offer sacrifice.  \n10\\. O Agni, bring us radiant light to be our mighty succour, for  \nThou art our visible deity!\n\n#### DECADE II Agni\n\n1\\. O Agni, God, the people sing reverent praise to thee for strength:  \nWith terrors trouble thou the foe  \n2\\. I seek with song your messenger, oblation-bearer, lord of wealth,  \nImmortal, best at sacrifice.  \n3\\. Still turning to their aim in thee the sacrificer's sister hymns  \nHave come to thee before the wind.  \n4\\. To thee, illuminer of night, O Agni, day by day with prayer,  \nBringing thee reverence, we come.  \n5\\. Help, thou who knowest lauds, this work, a lovely hymn in Rudra's praise,  \nAdorable in every house!  \n6\\. To this fair sacrifice to drink the milky draught art thou called forth:  \nO Agni, with the Maruts come!  \n7\\. With homage will I reverence thee, Agni, like a long-tailed steed,  \nImperial lord of holy rites.  \n8\\. As Aurva and as Bhrigu called, as Apnavana called, I call  \nThe radiant Agni robed with sea.  \n9\\. When he enkindles Agni, man should with his heart attend the song:  \nI kindle Agni till he glows.  \n10\\. Then, verily, they see the light refulgent of primeval seed,  \nKindled on yonder side of heaven.\n\n#### DECADE III Agni\n\n1\\. Hither, for powerful kinship, I call Agni, him who prospers you,  \nMost frequent at our solemn rites.  \n2\\. May Agni with his pointed blaze cast down each fierce devouring fiend:  \nMay Agni win us wealth by war!  \n3\\. Agni, be gracious; thou art great: thou hast approached the pious man,  \nHast come to sit on sacred grass.  \n4\\. Agni, preserve us,from distress consume our enemies, O God,  \nEternal, with thy hottest flames  \n5\\. Harness, O Agni, O thou God, thy steeds which are most excellent!  \nThe fleet ones bring thee rapidly.  \n6\\. Lord of the tribes, whom all must seek, we worshipped Agni set thee down,  \nRefulgent, rich in valiant men.  \n7\\. Agni is head and height of heaven, the master of the earth is he  \nHe quickeneth the waters' seed.  \n8\\. O Agni, graciously announce this our good fortune of the Gods,  \nAnd this our newest hymn of praise!  \n9, By song, O Agni, Angiras! Gopavana hath brought thee forth  \nHear thou my call, refulgent one!  \n10\\. Agni, the Sage, the Lord of Strength, hath moved around the sacred gifts,  \nGiving the offerer precious things.  \n11\\. His heralds bear him up aloft, the God who knoweth all that lives,  \nThe Sun, that all may look on him.  \n12, Praise Agni in the sacrifice, the Sage whose holy laws are true  \nThe God who driveth grief away.  \n13\\. Kind be the Goddesses to lend us help, and kind that we may drink:  \nMay their streams bring us health and wealth  \n14\\. Lord of the brave, whose songs dost thou in thine abundance now inspire,  \nThou whose hymns help to win the kine?\n\n#### DECADE IV Agni\n\n1\\. Sing to your Agni with each song, at every sacrifice for strength.  \nCome, let us praise the wise and, everlasting God even as a well-beloved\nfriend,  \n2\\. Agni, protect thou us by one, protect us by the second song,  \nProtect us by three hymns, O Lord of power and might, bright God, by four\nhymns guard us well!  \n3\\. O Agni, with thy lofty beams, with thy pure brilliancy, O God,  \nKindled, most youthful one! by Bharadvaja's hand, shine on us richly, holy\nLord!  \n4\\. O Agni who art worshipped well, dear let our princes be to thee,  \nOur wealthy patrons who are governors of men, who part, as gifts, the stall of\nkine!  \n5\\. Agni, praise-singer! Lord of men, God! burning up the Rakshasas,  \nMighty art thou, the ever-present, household-lord! home-friend and guardian\nfrom the sky.  \n6\\. Immortal Jatavedas, thou bright-hued refulgent gift of Dawn,  \nAgni, this day to him who pays oblations bring the Gods who waken with the\nmorn!  \n7\\. Wonderful, with thy favouring help, send us thy bounties, gracious Lord.  \nThou art the charioteer, Agni, of earthly wealth: find rest and safety for our\nseed!  \n8\\. Famed art thou, Agni, far and wide, preserver, righteous, and a Sage.  \nThe holy singers, O enkindled radiant one, ordainers, call on thee to come.  \n9\\. O holy Agni, give us wealth famed among men and strengthening life!  \nBestow on us, O helper, that which many crave, more glorious still through\nrighteousness!  \n10\\. To him, who dealeth out all wealth, the sweet-toned Hotar-priest of men,  \nTo him like the first vessels filled with savoury juice, to Agni let the lauds\ngo forth.\n\n#### DECADE V Agni\n\n1\\. With this mine homage I invoke Agni for you, the Son of Strength,  \nDear, wisest envoy, skilled in noble sacrifice, immortal messenger of all.  \n2\\. Thou liest in the logs that are thy mothers: mortals kindle thee.  \nAlert thou bearest off the sacrifleer's gift, and then thou shinest to the\nGods.  \n3\\. He hath appeared, best prosperer, in whom men lay their holy acts:  \nSo may our songs of praise come nigh to Agni who was born to give the Arya\nstrength!  \n4\\. Chief Priest is Agni at the laud, as stones and grass at sacrifice.  \nGods! Maruts! Brahmanaspati! I crave with song the help that is most\nexcellent.  \n5\\. Pray Agni of the piercing flame, with sacred songs, to be our help;  \nFor wealth, famed Agni, Purumilha and ye men! He is Suditi's sure defence.  \n6\\. Hear, Agni who hast ears to hear, with all thy train of escort Gods!  \nWith those who come at dawn let Mitra, Aryaman sit on the grass at sacrifice.  \n7\\. Agni of Divodasa, God, comes forth like Indra in his might.  \nRapidly hath he moved along his mother earth: he stands in high heaven's\ndwelling-place.  \n8\\. Whether thou come from earth or from the lofty lucid realm of heaven,  \nWax stronger in thy body through my song of praise: fill full all creatures, O\nmost wise!  \n9\\. If, loving well the forests, thou wentest to thy maternal floods,  \nNot to be scorned, Agni, is that return of thine when, from afar, thou now art\nhere.  \n10\\. O Agni, Manu stablished thee a light for all the race of men:  \nWith Kanva hast thou blazed, Law-born and waxen strong, thou whom the people\nreverence.\n\n### CHAPTER II\n\n#### DECADE I Agni\n\n1\\. The God who giveth wealth accept your full libation poured to, him!  \nPour ye it out, then fill the vessel full again, for so the God regardeth you.  \n2\\. Let Brahmanaspati come forth, let Sunrita the Goddess come,  \nAnd Gods bring to our rite which yields a fivefold gift the hero, lover of\nmankind!  \n3\\. Stand up erect to lend us aid, stand up like Savitar the God,  \nErect as strength-bestower when we call on thee with priests who balm our\nofferings!  \n4\\. The man who bringeth gifts to thee, bright God who fain wouldst lead to\nwealth,  \nWinneth himself a brave son, Agni! skilled in lauds, one prospering in a\nthousand ways.  \n5\\. With hymns and holy eulogies we supplicate your Agni, Lord  \nOf many families who duly serve the Gods, yea, him whom others too inflame.  \n6\\. This Agni is the Lord of great prosperity and hero, strength,  \nOf wealth with noble offspring and with store of kine, the Lord of battles\nwith the foe.  \n7\\. Thou, Agni, art the homestead's Lord, our Hotar-priest at sacrifice.  \nLord of all boons, thou art the Potar, passing wise. Pay worship, and enjoy\nthe good!  \n8\\. We as thy friends have chosen thee, mortals a God, to be our help.  \nThe Waters' Child, the blessed, the most mighty one, swift conqueror, and\nwithout a peer.\n\n#### DECADE II Agni\n\n1\\. Present oblations, make him splendid: set ye as Hotar in his place the\nHome's Lord, worshipped  \nWith gifts and homage where they pour libations! Honour him meet for reverence\nin our houses.  \n2\\. Verily wondrous is the tender youngling's growth who never draweth nigh to\ndrink his mother's milk.  \nAs soon as she who hath no udder bore him, he, faring on his. great errand,\nsuddenly grew strong.  \n3\\. Here is one light for thee, another yonder: enter the third and, be\ntherewith united.  \nBeautiful be thy union with the body, beloved in the Gods' sublimest\nbirthplace!  \n4\\. For Jatavedas, worthy of our praise, will we frame with our mind this\neulogy as 'twere a car;  \nFor good, in his assembly, is this care of ours. Let us not, in thy\nfriendship, Agni, suffer harm!  \n5\\. Agni Vaisvanara, born in course of Order, the messenger of earth, the head\nof heaven,  \nThe Sage, the sovran, guest of men, our vessel fit for their mouth, the Gods\nhave generated.  \n6\\. Even as the waters from the mountain ridges, so sprang the; Gods, through\nlauds, from thee, O Agni.  \nTo thee speed hymns and eulogies, as horses haste, bearing him who loves the\nsong, to battle.  \n7\\. Win to protect you, Rudra, lord of worship, priest of both worlds,\neffectual sacrificer,  \nAgni, invested with his golden colours, before the thunder strike and lay you\nsenseless!  \n8\\. The King whose face is decked with oil is kindled with homage offered by\nhis faithful servant.  \nThe men, the priests adore him with oblations. Agni hath shone forth at the\nflush of morning.  \n9\\. Agni advanceth with his lofty banner: through earth and heaven the Bull\nhath loudly bellowed  \nHe hath come nigh from the sky's farthest limit: the Steer hath waxen in the\nwaters' bosom.  \n10\\. From the two fire-sticks have the men engendered with thoughts, urged by\nthe hand, the glorious Agni,  \nFar-seen, with pointed flame, Lord of the Homestead.\n\n#### DECADE III Agni\n\n1\\. Agni is wakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who cometh like a\nmilch-cow.  \nLike young trees shooting up on high their branches, his flames. are mounting\nto the vault of heaven.  \n2\\. Set forth the gleaming one, the song-inspirer, not foolish with. the\nfoolish, fort-destroyer,  \nWho leadeth with his hymns to thought of conquest, gold-bearded, richly\nsplendid with his armour  \n3\\. Thou art like heaven: one form is bright, one holy, like Day and Night\ndissimilar in colour.  \nAll magic powers thou aidest, self-dependent! Auspicious bethy bounty here, O\nPushan!  \n4\\. As holy food, Agni, to thine invoker give wealth in cattle, lasting, rich\nin marvels!  \nTo us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious will\nto us-ward!  \n5\\. Stablished to fill the juice with vital vigour, giver of wealth, guard of\nhis servant's body,  \nThe great Priest, born, who knows the clouds, abider with men, is seated in\nthe waters' eddy.  \n6\\. Let the song, honouring the best, with longing honour the Asura's most\nfamous sovran,  \nThe deeds of him the mighty, deeds like Indra's, the manly one in whom the\nfolk must triumph!  \n7\\. In the two kindling-blocks lies Jatavedas like the well-cherished germ in\npregnant women,--  \nAgni who day by day must be entreated by men who watch provided with\noblations.  \n8\\. Agni, from days of old thou slayest demons: never shall Rakshasas in fight\no'ercome thee.  \nBurn up the foolish ones, raw flesh devourers: let none of them escape thine\nheavenly arrow!\n\n#### DECADE IV Agni\n\n1\\. Bring us most mighty splendour thou, Agni, resistless on thy way:  \nPrepare for us the path that leads to glorious opulence and strength!  \n2\\. May the brave man, if full of zeal he serve and kindle Agni's flame,  \nDuly presenting sacred gifts, enjoy the Gods' protecting help.  \n3\\. Thy bright smoke lifts itself aloft, and far-extended shines in heaven,  \nFor, Purifier! like the Sun thou beamest with thy radiant glow.  \n4\\. Thou, Agni, even as Mitra, hast a princely glory of thine own.  \nBright, active God, thou makest fame increase like means of nourishment.  \n5\\. At dawn let Agni, much-beloved, guest of the house, be glorified,  \nIn whom, the everlasting one, all mortals make their offerings blaze.  \n6\\. Most moving song be Agni's: shine on high, O rich in radiant light!  \nLike the chief consort of a King riches and strength proceed from thee.  \n7\\. Exerting all our strength with thoughts of power we glorify in speech  \nAgni your dear familiar friend, the darling guest in every house.  \n8\\. His beam hath lofty power of life: sing praise to Agni, to the God  \nWhom men have set in foremost place, like Mitra for their eulogy!  \n9\\. To noblest Agni, friend of man, chief Vritra-slayer, have we come-  \nWho with Srutarvan, Riksha's son, in lofty presence is inflamed.  \n10\\. Born as the loftiest Law commands, comrade of those who grew with him.  \nAgni, the sire of Kasyapa by faith, the mother, Manu, Sage.\n\n#### DECADE V Agni\n\n1\\. We in King Soma place our trust, in Agni, and in Varuna,  \nThe Aditya, Vishnu, Surya, and the Brahman-priest Brihaspati.  \n2\\. Hence have these men gone up on high and mounted to the heights of heaven:  \nOn! conquer on the path by which Angirasas travelled to the skies!  \n3\\. That thou mayst send us ample wealth, O Agni, we will kindler thee:  \nSo, for the great oblation, Steer, pray Heaven and Earth to come to us!  \n4\\. He runs when one calls after him, This is the prayer of him who prays.  \nHe holds all knowledge in his grasp even as the felly rounds the wheel.  \n5\\. Shoot forth, O Agni, with thy flame: demolish them on every side!  \nBreak down the Yatudhana's strength, the vigour of the Rakshasa!  \n6\\. Worship the Vasus, Agni! here, the Rudras and Adityas, all  \nWho know fair sacrifices, sprung from Mann, scattering blessings down!\n\n## BOOK II\n\n### CHAPTER I\n\n#### DECADE I Agni\n\n1\\. Agni, thy faithful servant I call upon thee with many a gift,  \nAs in the keeping of the great inciting God.  \n2\\. To Agni, to the Hotar-priest offer your best, your lofty speech,  \nTo him ordainer-like who bears the light of songs.  \n3\\. O Agni, thou who art the lord of wealth in kine, thou Son of Strength,  \nBestow on us, O Jatavedas, high renown  \n4\\. Most skilled in sacrifice, bring the Gods, O Agni, to the pious, man:  \nA joyful Priest, thy splendour drives our foes afar  \n5\\. Taught by seven mothers at his birth was he, for glory of the wise.  \nHe, firm and sure, hath set his mind on glorious wealth  \n6\\. And in the day our prayer is this: May Aditi come nigh to help,  \nWith loving-kindness bring us weal and chase our foes  \n7\\. Worship thou Jatavedas, pray to him who willingly accepts,  \nWhose smoke wanders at will, and none may grasp his flame  \n8\\. No mortal man can e'er prevail by arts of magic over him  \nWho hath served Agni well, the oblation-giving God.  \n9\\. Agni, drive thou the wicked foe, the evil-hearted thief away,  \nFar, far, Lord of the brave! and give us easy paths!  \n10\\. O hero Agni, Lord of men, on hearing this new laud of mine  \nBurn down the Rakshasas, enchanters, with thy flame!\n\n#### DECADE II Agni\n\n1\\. Sing forth to him the holy, most munificent, sublime with his refulgent\nglow,  \nTo Agni, ye Upastutas  \n2\\. Agni, he conquers by thine aid that brings him store of valiant sons and\ndoes great deeds,  \nWhose bond of friendship is thy choice  \n3\\. Sing praise to him the Lord of light! The Gods have made the God to be\ntheir messenger,  \nTo bear oblation to the Gods.  \n4\\. Anger not him who is our guest! He is the bright God Agni, praised by many\na man,  \nGod Hotar, skilled in sacrifice.  \n5\\. May Agni, worshipped, bring us bliss: may the gift, blessed one! and\nsacrifice bring bliss.  \nYea, may our eulogies bring bliss.  \n6\\. Thee have we chosen skilfullest in sacrifice, immortal Priest among the\nGods,  \nWise finisher of this holy rite.  \n7\\. Bring us that splendour, Agni, which may overcome each greedy fiend in our\nabode,  \nAnd the malicious wrath of men!  \n8\\. Soon as the eager Lord of men is friendly unto Manu's race  \nAgni averteth from us all the Rakshasas!\n\n#### DECADE III Indra\n\n1\\. Sing this, beside the flowing juice, to him your hero, much-invoked,  \nTo please him as a mighty Bull  \n2\\. O Satakratu Indra, now rejoice with that carouse of thine  \nWhich is most glorious of all!  \n3\\. Ye cows, protect the fount: the two mighty ones bless the sacrifice.  \nThe handles twain are wrought of gold.  \n4\\. Sing praises that the horse may come; sing, Srutakaksha, that the cow  \nMay come, that Indra's might may come  \n5\\. We make this Indra very strong to strike, the mighty Vritra dead:  \nA vigorous hero shall he be.  \n6\\. Based upon strength and victory and power, O Indra, is thy birth:  \nThou, mighty one! art strong indeed,  \n7\\. The sacrifice made Indra great when he unrolled the earth, and made  \nHimself a diadem in heaven.  \n8\\. If I, O Indra, were, like thee, the single ruler over wealth  \nMy worshipper should be rich in kine.  \n9\\. Pressers, blend Soma juice for him, each draught most excellent, for him  \nThe brave, the hero, for his joy.  \n10\\. Here is the Soma juice expressed. O Vasu, drink till thou art full:  \nUndaunted God, we give it thee\n\n#### DECADE IV Indra\n\n1\\. Surya, thou mountest up to meet the hero famous for his wealth,  \nWho hurls the bolt and works for man.  \n2\\. Whatever, Vritra-slayer! thou, Surya hast risen upon to-day,  \nThat, Indra, all is in thy power.  \n3\\. That Indra is our youthful friend, who with his trusty guidanceled  \nTurvasa, Yadu from afar.  \n4\\. O Indra, let not ill designs surround us in the sunbeams' light  \nThis may we gain with thee for friend!  \n5\\. Indra, bring wealth that gives delight, the victor's ever-conquering\nwealth,  \nMost excellent, to be our aid  \n6\\. In mighty battle we invoke Indra, Indra is lesser fight,  \nThe friend who bends his bolt at fiends.  \n7\\. In battle of a thousand arms Indra drank Kadru's Soma juice  \nThere he displayed his manly might.  \n8\\. Faithful to thee, we sing aloud, heroic Indra, songs to thee  \nMark, O good Lord, this act of ours!  \n9\\. Hitherward! they who light the flame and straightway trim the sacred\ngrass,  \nWhose friend is Indra ever young.  \n10\\. Drive all our enemies away, smite down the foes who press around,  \nAnd bring the wealth for which we long!\n\n#### DECADE V Indra and others\n\n1\\. I Hear, as though 'twere close at hand, the cracking of the whips they\nhold:  \nThey gather splendour on their way.  \n2\\. Indra, these friends of ours, supplied with Soma, wait and look to thee  \nAs men with fodder to the herd.  \n3\\. Before his hot displeasure all the peoples, all the men bow down,  \nAs rivers bow them to the sea.  \n4\\. We choose unto ourselves that high protection of the mighty Gods,  \nThat it may help and succour us.  \n5\\. O Brahmanaspati, make thou Kakshivan Ausija a loud  \nChanter of flowing Soma juice!  \n6\\. Much honoured with libations may the Vritra-slayer watch for us:  \nMay Sakra listen to our prayer  \n7\\. Send us this day, God Savitar, prosperity with progeny  \nDrive thou the evil dream away!  \n8\\. Where is that ever-youthful Steer, strong-necked and never yet bent down?  \nWhat Brahman ministers to him?  \n9\\. There where the mountains downward slope, there at the meeting of the\nstreams  \nThe Sage was manifest by song.  \n10\\. Praise Indra whom our songs must laud, sole sovran of mankind, the chief  \nMost liberal who controlleth men\n\n### CHAPTER II\n\n#### DECADE I Indra and others\n\n1\\. Indra whose jaws are strong hath drunk of worshipping Sudaksha's draught,  \nThe Soma juice with barley brew.  \n2\\. O Lord of ample wealth, these songs of praise have called aloud to thee,  \nLike milch-kine lowing to their calves!  \n3\\. Then straight they recognized the mystic name of the creative Steer,  \nThere in the mansion of the Moon.  \n4\\. When Indra, strongest hero, brought the streams, the mighty waters down,  \nPushan was standing by his side.  \n5\\. The Cow, the streaming mother of the liberal Maruts, pours her milk,  \nHarnessed to draw their chariots on.  \n6\\. Come, Lord of rapturous joys, to our libation with thy bay steeds, come  \nWith bay steeds to the flowing juice  \n7\\. Presented strengthening gifts have sent Indra away at sacrifice,  \nWith night, unto the cleansing bath.  \n8\\. I from my Father have received deep knowledge of eternal Law:  \nI was born like unto the Sun.  \n9\\. With Indra splendid feasts be ours, rich in all strengthening things,\nwherewith,  \nWealthy in food, we may rejoice  \n10\\. Soma and Pushan, kind to him who travels to the Gods, provide  \nDwellings all happy and secure.\n\n#### DECADE II Indra\n\n1\\. Invite ye Indra with a song to drink your draught of Soma steeds, juice,  \nAll-conquering Satakratu, most munificent of all who live  \n2\\. Sing ye a song, to make him glad, to Indra, Lord of tawny  \nThe Soma-drinker, O my friends!  \n3\\. This, even this, O Indra, we implore: as thy devoted friends  \nThe Kanvas praise thee with their hymns!  \n4\\. For Indra, lover of carouse, loud be our songs about the juice  \nLet poets sing the song of praise.  \n5\\. Here, Indra, is thy Soma draught, made pure upon the sacred grass:  \nRun hither, come and drink thereof  \n6\\. As a good cow to him who milks, we call the doer of good deeds  \nTo our assistance duy by day.  \n7\\. Hero, the Soma being shed, I pour the juice for thee to drink  \nSate thee and finish thy carouse!  \n8\\. The Soma, Indra, which is shed in saucers and in cups for thee,  \nDrink thou, for thou art lord thereof!  \n9\\. In every need, in every fray we call, as friends, to succour us,  \nIndra, the mightiest of all.  \n10\\. O come ye hither, sit ye down: to Indra sing ye forth your song,  \nCompanions, bringing hymns of praise\n\n#### DECADE III Indra\n\n1\\. So, Lord of affluent gifts, this juice hath been expressed for thee with\nstrength:  \nDrink of it, thou who lovest song!  \n2\\. Great is our Indra from of old; greatness be his, the Thunderer  \nWide as the heaven extends his might.  \n3\\. Indra, as one with mighty arm, gather for us with thy right hand  \nManifold and nutritious spoil!  \n4\\. Praise, even as he is known, with song Indra the guardian of the kine,  \nThe Son of Truth, Lord of the brave.  \n5\\. With what help will he come to us, wonderful, ever-waxing friend?  \nWith what most mighty company?  \n6\\. Thou speedest down to succour us this ever-conquering God of yours  \nHim who is drawn to all our songs.  \n7\\. To the assembly's wondrous Lord, the lovely friend of Indra, I  \nHad prayed for wisdom and successs.  \n8\\. May all thy paths beneath the sky whereby thou speddest Vyasva on,  \nYea, let all spaces hear our voice  \n9\\. Bring to us all things excellent, O Satakratu, food and strength,  \nFor, Indra, thou art kind to us!  \n10\\. Here is the Soma ready pressed: of this the Maruts, yea, of this,  \nSelf-luminous the Asvins drink.\n\n#### DECADE IV Indra and others\n\n1\\. Tossing about, the active ones came nigh to Indra at his birth,  \nWinning themselves heroic might.  \n2\\. Never, O Gods, do we offend, nor are we ever obstinate  \nWe walk as holy texts command.  \n3\\. Evening is come: sing loudly thou Atharvan's nobly singing son:  \nGive praise to Savitar the God!  \n4\\. Now Morning with her earliest light shines forth, dear daughter of the\nSky:  \nHigh, Asvins, I extol your praise.  \n5\\. Armed with the bones of dead Dadhyach, Indra, with unresisted might  \nThe nine-and-ninety Vritras slew.  \n6\\. Come, Indra, and delight thee with the juice at all our Soma feasts,  \nProtector, mighty in thy strength  \n7\\. O thou who slayest Vritras, come, O Indra, hither to our side,  \nMighty one, with thy mighty aids!  \n8\\. That might of his shone brightly forth when Indra brought together, like  \nA skin, the worlds of heaven and earth,  \n9\\. This is thine own Thou drawest near, as turns a pigeon to his mate:  \nThou carest, too, for this our prayer.  \n10\\. May Vata breathe his balm on us, healthful, delightful to our heart:  \nMay he prolong our days of life\n\n#### DECADE V Indra and others\n\n1\\. Ne'er is he injured whom the Gods Varuna, Mitra, Aryam.  \nThe excellently wise, protect.  \n2\\. According to our wish for kine, for steeds and chariots, as of old,  \nBe gracious to our wealthy chiefs  \n3\\. Indra, these spotted cows yield thee their butter and the milky draught,  \nAiders, thereby, of sacrifice.  \n4\\. That thou much-lauded! many-named! mayst, with this thought, that longs\nfor milk,  \nCome to each Soma sacrifice.  \n5\\. May bright Sarasvati, endowed with plenteous wealth and spoil, enriched  \nWith prayer, desire the sacrifice.  \n6\\. Why 'mid the Nahusha tribes shall sate this Indra with his Soma juice?  \nHe shall bring precious things to us.  \n7\\. Come, we have pressed the juice for thee; O Indra, drink this Soma here:  \nSit thou on this my sacred grass  \n8\\. Great, unassailable must be the heavenly favour of the Three,  \nVaruna, Mitra, Aryaman.  \n9\\. We, Indra, Lord of ample wealth, our guide, depend on one like thee,  \nThou driver of the tawny steeds!\n\n## BOOK III\n\n### CHAPTER I\n\n#### DECADE I Indra\n\n1\\. Let Soma juices make thee glad! Display thy bounty, Thunderer:  \nDrive off the enemies of prayer!  \n2\\. Drink our libation, Lord of hymns! with streams of meath thou art bedewed:  \nYea, Indra, glory is thy gift.  \n3\\. Indra hath ever thought of you and tended you with care. The God,  \nHeroic Indra, is not checked.  \n4\\. Let the drops pass within thee as the rivers flow into the sea  \nO Indra, naught excelleth thee!  \n5\\. Indra, the singers with high praise, Indra reciters with their lauds,  \nIndra the choirs have glorified.  \n6\\. May Indra give, to aid us wealth handy that rules the skilful ones!  \nYea, may the Strong give potent wealth  \n7\\. Verily Indra, conquering all, drives even mighty fear away,  \nFor firm is he and swift to act.  \n8\\. These songs with every draught we pour come, lover of the song, to thee  \nAs milch-kine hasten to their calves.  \n9\\. Indra and Wishan will we call for friendship and prosperity,  \nAnd for the winning of the spoil.  \n10\\. O Indra, Vritra-slayer, naught is better, mightier than thou  \nVerily there is none like thee!\n\n#### DECADE II Indra\n\n1\\. Him have I magnified, our Lord in common, guardian of your folk,  \nDiscloser of great wealth in kine.  \n2\\. Songs have outpoured themselves to thee, Indra, the strong, the guardian\nLord,  \nAnd with one will have risen to thee!  \n3\\. Good guidance hath the mortal man whom Arya-man, the Marut host,  \nAnd Mitras, void of guile, protect.  \n4\\. Bring us the wealth for which we long, O Indra, that which is concealed  \nIn strong firm place precipitous.  \n5\\. Him your best Vritra-slayer, him the famous champion of mankind  \nI urge to great munificence.  \n6\\. Indra, may we adorn thy fame, fame of one like thee, hero! deck,  \nSakra! thy fame at highest feast!  \n7\\. Indra, accept at break of day our Soma mixt with roasted corn,  \nWith groats, with cake, with eulogies!  \n8\\. With waters' foam thou torest off, Indra, the head of Namuchi,  \nWhen thou o'ercamest all the foes.  \n9\\. Thine are these Soma juices, thine, Indra, those still to be expressed:  \nEnjoy them, Lord of princely wealth!  \n10\\. For thee, O Indra, Lord of light, Somas are pressed and grass is strewn:  \nBe gracious to thy worshippers!\n\n1\\. We seeking strength, with Soma drops fill full your Indra like a well,  \nMost liberal, Lord of boundless might.  \n2\\. O Indra, even from that place come unto us with food that gives  \nA hundred, yea, a thousand powers!  \n3\\. The new-born Vritra-slayer asked his mother, as he seized his shaft,  \nWho are the, fierce and famous ones?  \n4\\. Let us call him to aid whose hands stretch far, the highly-lauded, who  \nFulfils the work to favour us  \n5\\. Mitra who knoweth leadeth us, and Varuna who guideth straight,  \nAnd Aryaman in accord with Gods.  \n6\\. When, even as she were present here, red Dawn hath shone from far away,  \nShe spreadeth light on every side.  \n7\\. Varuna, Mitra, sapient pair, pour fatness on our pastures, pour  \nMeath on the regions of the air!  \n8\\. And, at our sacrifices, these, sons, singers, have enlarged their bounds,  \nSo that the cows must walk knee-deep.  \n9\\. Through all this world strode Vishnu: thrice his foot he planted, and the\nwhole  \nWas gathered in his footstep's dust.\n\n#### DECADE IV Indra\n\n1\\. Pass by the wrathful offerer; speed the man who pours libation, drink  \nThe juice which he presents to thee!  \n2\\. What is the word addressed to him, God great and excellently wise?  \nFor this is what exalteth him.  \n3, His wealth who hath no store of kine hath ne'er found out recited laud,  \nNor song of praises that is sung.  \n4\\. Lord of each thing that giveth strength, Indra delighteth most in lauds,  \nBorne by bay steeds, libations' friend.  \n5\\. With wealth to our libation come, be not thou angry with us, like  \nA great man with a youthful bride.  \n6\\. When, Vasu, wilt thou love the laud? Now let the Channel bring the stream.  \nThe juice is ready to ferment.  \n7\\. After the Seasons. Indra, drink the Soma from the Brahman's gift:  \nThy friendship is invincible!  \nS. O Indra, lover of the song, we are the singers of thy praise  \nO Soma-drinker, quicken us!  \n9\\. O Indra, in each fight and fray give to our bodies manly strength:  \nStrong Lord, grant ever-conquering might!  \n10\\. For so thou art the brave man's friend; a hero, too, art thou, and\nstrong:  \nSo may thine heart be won to us!\n\n#### DECADE V Indra\n\n1\\. Like kine unmilked we call aloud, hero, to thee, and sing thy praise,  \nLooker on heavenly light, Lord of this moving world, Lord, Indra, of what\nmoveth not!  \n2\\. That we may win us wealth and power we poets, verily, call on thee:  \nIn war men call on thee, Indra, the hero's Lord, in the steed's race-course\ncall on thee:  \n3\\. To you will I sing Indra's praise who gives good gifts as well we know;  \nThe praise of Maghavan who, rich in treasure, aids his singers with wealth\nthousandfold.  \n4\\. As cows low to their calves in stalls, so with our songs we glorify  \nThis Indra, even your wondrous God who checks attack, who takes delight in\nprecious juice.  \n5\\. Loud singing at the sacred rite where Soma flows we priests invoke  \nWith haste, that he may help, as the bard's cherisher, Indra who findeth\nwealth for you  \n6\\. With Plenty for his true ally the active man will gain the spoil.  \nYour Indra, much-invoked, I bend with song, as bends a wright his wheel of\nsolid wood.  \n7\\. Drink, Indra, of the savoury juice, and cheer thee with our milky draught!  \nBe, for our weal, our friend and sharer of the feast, and let thy wisdom guard\nus well!  \n8\\. For thou--come to the worshipper!--wilt find great wealth to make us rich.  \nFill thyself full, O Maghavan, for gain of kine, full, Indra, for the gain of\nsteeds!  \n9\\. Vasishtha will not overlook the lowliest one among you all  \nBeside our Soma juice effused to-day let all the Maruts drink with eager\nhaste!  \n10\\. Glorify naught besides, O friends; so shall no sorrow trouble you!  \nPraise only mighty Indra when the juice is shed, and say your lauds\nrepeatedly!\n\n### CHAPTER II\n\n#### DECADE I Indra\n\n1\\. No one by deed attains to him who works and strengthens evermore:  \nNo, not by sacrifice, to Indra. praised of all, resistless, daring, bold in\nmight.  \n2 He without ligature, before making incision in the neck,  \nClosed up the wound again, most wealthy Maghavan, who healeth the dissevered\nparts.  \n3\\. A thousand and a hundred steeds are harnessed to thy golden car:  \nYoked by devotion, Indra, let the long-maned bays bring thee to drink the Soma\njuice!  \n4\\. Come hither, Indra, with bay steeds, joyous, with tails like peacock's\nplumes!  \nLet no men check thy course as fowlers stay the bird: pass o'er them as o'er\ndesert lands!  \n5\\. Thou as a God, O mightiest, verily blessest mortal man.  \nO Maghavan, there is no comforter but thou: Indra, I speak my words to thee.  \n6\\. O Indra, thou art far-renowned, impetuous Lord of power and might.  \nAlone, the never-conquered guardian of mankind, thou smitest  \ndown resistless foes.  \n7\\. Indra for worship of the Gods, Indra while sacrifice proceeds,  \nIndra, as warriors in the battle-shock, we call, Indra that we may win the\nspoil.  \n8\\. May these my songs of praise exalt thee, Lord, who hast abundant wealth!  \nMen skilled in holy hymns, pure, with the hues of fire, have sung them with\ntheir lauds to thee.  \n9\\. These songs of ours exceeding sweet, these hymns of praise ascend to thee,  \nLike ever-conquering chariots that display their strength gain wealth and give\nunfailing help.  \n10\\. Even as the wild-bull, when he thirsts, goes to the desert's watery pool,  \nCome to us quickly both at morning and at eve, and with the Kanvas drink thy\nfill!\n\n#### DECADE II Indra and others\n\n1\\. Indra, with all thy saving helps assist us, Lord of power and might!  \nFor after thee we follow even as glorious bliss, thee, hero, finderout of\nwealth.  \n2\\. O Indra, Lord of light, what joys thou broughtest from the Asuras,  \nProsper therewith, O Maghavan, him who lauds that deed, and those whose grass\nis trimmed for thee!  \n3\\. To Aryaman and Mitra sing a reverent song, O pious one,  \nA pleasant hymn to Varuna who shelters us: sing ye a laud unto the Kings!  \n4\\. Men with their lauds are urging thee, Indra, to drink the Soma first.  \nThe Ribhus in accord have lifted up their voice, and Rudras sung thee as the\nfirst.  \n5\\. Sing to your lofty Indra, sing, Maruts, a holy hymn of praise  \nLet Satakratu, Vritra-slayer, slay the foe with hundred-knotted thunderbolt!  \n6\\. To Indra sing the lofty hymn, Maruts! that slays the Vritras best,  \nWhereby the holy ones created for the God the light divine that ever wakes.  \n7\\. O Indra, give us wisdom as a sire gives wisdom to his sons  \nGuide us, O much-invoked, in this our way: may we still live and look upon the\nlight!  \n8\\. O Indra, turn us not away: be present with us at our feast  \nFor thou art our protection, yea, thou art our kin: O Indra, turn us not away!  \n9\\. We compass these like waters, we whose grass is trimmed and Soma pressed.  \nHere where the filter pours its stream, thy worshippers round  \nthee, O Vritra-slayer, sit.  \n10\\. All strength and valour that is found, Indra, in tribes of Nahushas,  \nAnd all the splendid fame that the Five Tribes enjoy, bring, yea, all manly\npowers at once!\n\n#### DECADE III Indra\n\n1\\. Yea, verily thou art a Bull, our guardian, rushing like a bull:  \nThou, mighty one, art celebrated as a Bull, famed as a Bull both near and far.  \n2\\. Whether, O Sakra, thou be far, or, Vritra-slayer, near at hand,  \nThence by heaven-reaching songs he who bath pressed the juice invites thee\nwith thy long-maned steeds.  \n3\\. In the wild raptures of the juice sing to your hero with high laud, to him\nthe wise,  \nTo Indra glorious in his name, the mighty one, even as the hymn alloweth it!  \n4\\. O Indra, give us for our weal a triple refuge, triply strong!  \nBestow a dwelling-place on our rich lords and me, and keep thy dart afar from\nthese!  \n5\\. Turning, as 'twere, to meet the Sun enjoy from Indra all good things!  \nWhen he who will be born is born with power we look to treasures as our\nheritage.  \n6\\. The godless mortal gaineth not this food, O thou whose life is long!  \nBut one who yokes the bright-hued horses, Etasas; then Indra yokes his tawny\nsteeds.  \n7\\. Draw near unto our Indra who must be invoked in every fight!  \nCome, thou most mighty Vritra-slayer, meet for praise, come to, libations and\nto hymns!  \n8\\. Thine, Indra, is the lowest wealth, thou cherishest the midmost wealth,  \nThou ever rulest all the highest: in the fray for cattle none resisteth thee.  \n9\\. Where art thou? Whither art thou gone? For many a place attracts thy mind.  \nHaste, warrior, fort-destroyer, Lord of battle's din! haste, holy songs have\nsounded forth!  \n10\\. Here, verily, yesterday we let the thunder-wielder drink his fill.  \nBring him the juice poured forth in sacrifice to-day. Now range you by the\nglorious one!\n\n#### DECADE IV Indra\n\n1\\. He who as sovran Lord of men moves with his chariots unrestrained,  \nThe Vritra-slayer, vanquisher of fighting hosts, pre-eminent, is praised in\nsong.  \n2\\. Indra, give us security from that whereof we are afraid  \nHelp us, O Maghavan, let thy favour aid us thus; drive away foes and enemies!  \n3\\. Strong pillar thou, Lord of the home! armour of Soma-offerers!  \nThe drop of Soma breaketh all the strongholds down, and Indra is the Rishis'\nfriend.  \n4\\. Verily, Surya, thou art great; truly, Aditya, thou art great!  \nO most admired for greatness of thy majesty, God, by thy greatness thou art\ngreat!  \n5\\. Indra! thy friend, when fair of form and rich in chariots, steeds, and\nkine,  \nHath ever vital power that gives him strength, and joins the company with\nradiant men.  \n6\\. O Indra, if a hundred heavens and if a hundred earths were thine,--  \nNo, not a hundred suns could match thee at thy birth, not both the worlds, O\nThunderer!  \n7\\. Though, Indra, thou art called by men eastward and west ward, north and\nsouth,  \nThou chiefly art with Anava and Turvasa, brave champion urged by men to come.  \n8\\. Indra whose wealth is in thyself, what mortal will attack this man?  \nThe strong will win the spoil on the decisive day through faith in thee, O\nMaghavan!  \n9\\. First, Indra! Agni! hath this Maid come footless unto those with feet.  \nStretching her head and speaking loudly with her tongue, she hath gone\ndownward thirty steps.  \n10\\. Come, Indra, very near to us with aids of firmly-based resolve  \nCome, most auspicious, with thy most auspicious help; good kinsman, with good\nkinsmen come!\n\n#### DECADE V Indra.\n\n1\\. Call to your aid the eternal one who shoots and none may shoot at him,  \nInciter, swift, victorious, best of charioteers, unconquered, Tugriya's\nstrengthener!  \n2\\. Let none, no, not thy worshippers, delay thee far away from us  \nEven from faraway come thou unto our feast, or listen if' already here!  \n3\\. For Indra Soma-drinker, armed with thunder, press the Soma juice;  \nMake ready your dressed meats: cause him to favour us! The giver blesses him\nwho gives.  \n4\\. We call upon that Indra who, most active, ever slays the foe  \nWith boundless spirit, Lord of heroes, manliest one, help thou and prosper us\nin fight!  \n5\\. Ye rich in strength, through your great power vouchsafe us blessings day\nand night!  \nThe offerings which we bring to you shall never fail gifts brought by us shall\nnever fail.  \n6\\. Whenever mortal worshipper will sing a bounteous giver's praise,  \nLet him with song inspired laud Varuna who supports the folk who follow varied\nrites.  \n7\\. Drink milk to Indra in the joy of Soma juice, Medhyatithi!  \nTo golden Indra ever close to his bay steeds, the thunder-armed, the golden\none!  \n8\\. Both boons,-may Indra, hitherward turned listen to this prayer of ours,  \nAnd mightiest Maghavar, with thought inclined to us come near to drink the\nSoma juice!  \n9\\. Not for an ample price dost thou, Stone-caster! give thyself away,  \nNot for a thousand, Thunderer! nor ten thousand, nor a hundred, Lord of\ncountless wealth!  \n10\\. O Indra, thou art more to me than sire or niggard brother is.  \nThou and my mother, O good Lord, appear alike, to give me wealth abundantly.\n\n## BOOK IV\n\n### CHAPTER I\n\n#### DECADE I Indra and others\n\n1\\. These Soma juice mixt with curd have been expressed for Indra here:  \nCome with thy bay steeds, Thunder-wielder, to our home, to drink them till\nthey make thee glad!  \n2\\. Indra, these Somas with their lauds have been prepared for thy delight.  \nDrink of the pleasant juice and listen to our songs; lover of song, reward the\nhymn!  \n3\\. I call on thee, Sabardugha, this day, inspirer of the psalm.  \nIndra, the richly-yielding milch-cow who provides unfailing food in ample\nstream.  \n4\\. Indra, the strong and lofty hills are powerless to bar thy way  \nNone stays that act of thine when thou wouldst fain give wealth to one like me\nwho sings thy praise.  \n5\\. Who knows what vital power he wins, drinking beside the flowing juice?  \nThis is the fair-cheeked. God who, joying in the draught, breaks down the\ncastles in his strength.  \n6\\. What time thou castest from his seat and punishest the riteless man,  \nStrengthen for opulence, O Indra Maghavan, our plant desired by many a one!  \n7\\. Let Tvashtar, Brahmanaspati, Parjanya guard our heavenly word,  \nAditi with her sons, the brothers, guard for us the invincible, the saving\nword!  \n8\\. Ne'er art thou fruitless, Indra, ne'er dost thou desert the worshipper:  \nBut now, O Maghavan, thy bounty as a God is poured forth ever more and more.  \n9\\. Best slayer of the Vritras, yoke thy bay steeds, Indra, far away  \nCome with the high ones hither, Maghavan, to us, mighty, to, drink the Soma\njuice!  \n10\\. O Thunderer, zealous worshippers gave thee drink this time yesterday:  \nSo, Indra, listen here to him who offers lauds: come near unto, our dwelling-\nplace!\n\n#### DECADE II\n\n1\\. Advancing, sending forth her rays, the daughter of the Sky is seen.  \nThe mighty one lays bare the darkness with her eye, the friendly Lady makes\nthe light.  \n2\\. These morning sacrifices call you, Asvins, at the break of day.  \nFor help have I invoked you rich in power and might: for, house by house, ye\nvisit all.  \n3\\. Where are ye, Gods? What mortal man, O Asvins, glows with zeal for you,  \nUrging you with the crushing stone and with the stalk of Soma thus or\notherwise?  \n4\\. This sweetest Soma juice hath been expressed for you at morning rites.  \nAsvins, drink this prepared ere yesterday and give treasures to him who offers\nit!  \n5\\. Let me not, still beseeching thee with might and sound of Soma drops,  \nAnger at sacrifice a fierce wild creature! Who would not beseech the almighty\none!  \n6\\. Adhvaryu, let the Soma flow, for Indra longs to drink thereof.  \nHe even now hath yoked his vigorous bay steeds: the Vritraslayer hath come\nnigh.  \n7\\. Bring thou all this unto the good, O Indra, to the old and young!  \nFor, Maghavan, thou art rich in treasures from of old, to be invoked in every\nfight.  \n8\\. If I, O Indra, were the lord of riches ample as thine own,  \nI would support the singer, God who scatterest wealth! and not abandon him to\nwoe.  \n9\\. Thou in thy battles, Indra, art subduer of all hostile bands.  \nFather art thou, all-conquering, cancelling the curse, thou victor of the\nvanquisher!  \n10\\. For in thy might thou stretchest out beyond the mansions of the sky.  \nThe earthly region, Indra, comprehends thee not. Thou hast waxed mighty over\nall.\n\n#### DECADE III\n\n1\\. Pressed is the juice divine with milk commingled: thereto hath Indra ever\nbeen accustomed.  \nWe wake thee, Lord of bays, with sacrifices: mark this our laud in the wild\njoys of Soma!  \n2\\. A home is made for thee to dwell in, Indra: O much-invoked one, with the\nmen go thither!  \nThou, that thou mayest guard us and increase us, givest us wealth and joyest\nin the Somas.  \n3\\. The well thou clavest, settest free the fountains, and gavest rest to\nfloods that were obstructed.  \nThou, Indra, laying the great mountain open, slaying the Ddnava, didst loose\nthe torrents.  \n4\\. When we have pressed the juice we laud thee, Indra, most valorous! even\nabout to win the booty.  \nBring us prosperity, and by thy great wisdom, under thine own protection, may\nwe conquer!  \n5\\. Thy right hand have we grasped in ours, O Indra, longing, thou very Lord\nof wealth, for treasures.  \nBecause we know thee, hero, Lord of cattle: vouchsafe us mighty and\nresplendent riches!  \n6\\. Men call on Indra in the armed encounter that he may make the hymns they\nsing decisive.  \nHero in combat and in love of glory, give us a portion of the stall of cattle!  \n7\\. Like birds of beauteous wing the Priyamedhas, Rishis, imploring, have come\nnigh to Indra.  \nDispel the darkness and fill full our vision: deliver us as men whom snares\nentangle!  \n8\\. They gaze on thee with longing in their spirit, as on a strongwinged bird\nthat mounteth sky-ward;  \nOn thee with wings of gold, Varuna's envoy, the Bird that hasteneth to the\nhome of Yama.  \n9\\. First in the ancient time was Prayer engendered: Vena disclosed the bright\nones from the summit,  \nLaid bare this world's lowest and highest regions, womb of the existent and\nthe non-existent.  \n10\\. They have prepared and fashioned for this hero words never matched, most\nplentiful, most auspicious,  \nFor him the ancient, great, strong, energetic, the very mighty wielder of the\nthunder.\n\n#### DECADE IV Indra\n\n1\\. The black drop sank in Ansumati's bosom, advancing with ten thousand round\nabout it.  \nIndra with might longed for it as it panted: the hero-hearted King laid down\nhis weapons.  \n2\\. Flying in terror from the snort of Vritra all deities who were thy friends\nforsook thee.  \nSo, Indra, with the Maruts be thy friendship: in all these battles thou shalt\nbe the victor.  \n3\\. The old hath waked the young Moon from his slumber who runs his circling\ncourse with many round him.  \nBehold the God's high wisdom in its greatness: he who died yesterday to-day is\nliving.  \n4\\. Then, at thy birth, thou wast the foeman, Indra, of those the seven who\nne'er had met a rival.  \nThe hidden pair, heaven and the earth, thou foundest, and to the mighty worlds\nthou gavest pleasure.  \n5\\. A friend we count thee, sharp-edged, thunder-wielder, Steer strong of\nbody, overthrowing many.  \nThou, helping, causest pious tribes to conquer: Indra, I laud the, heavenly\nVritra-slayer.  \n6\\. Bring to the wise, the great, who waxeth mighty your offerings,. and make\nready your devotion!  \nGo forth to many tribes as man's controller!  \n7\\. Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best hero in this fight where spoil\nis gathered,  \nStrong, listening to give us aid in battles, who slays the Vritras, wins and\ngathers riches!  \n8\\. Prayers have been offered up-through love of glory: Vasishtha, honour\nIndra in the battle!  \nHe who with fame extends through all existence hears words which I, his\nfaithful servant, utter.  \n9\\. May the sweet Soma juices make him happy to cast his quoit that lies in\ndepth of waters!  \nThou from the udder which o'er earth is fastened hast poured the milk into the\nkine and herbage.\n\n#### DECADE V Indra and others\n\n1\\. This vigorous one whom deities commission, the conqueror of cars, the\nstrong and mighty,  \nSwift, fleet to battle, with uninjured fellies, even Tarkshya for our weal\nwill we call hither.  \n2\\. Indra the rescuer, Indra the helper, hero who listens at each invocation,  \nSakra I call, Indra invoked of many. May Indra Maghavan accept our presents!  \n3\\. Indra whose right hand wields the bolt we worship, driver of bay steeds\nseeking sundered courses.  \nShaking his beard with might he hath arisen, terrible with his weapons, with\nhis bounty.  \n4\\. The ever-slaying, bold and furious Indra, the bright bolt's Lord, the\nstrong, the great, the boundless,  \nWho slayeth Vritra and acquireth booty, giver of blessings, Maghavan the\nbounteous.  \n5\\. The man who lies in wait and fights against us, deeming himself a giant or\na hero,--  \nBy battle or with strength destroy him, Indra! With thy help, manly-souled!\nmay we be victors!  \n6\\. He whom men call when striving with their foemen, or speeding onward in\narray of battle,  \nWhom bards incite where heroes win the booty, or in the way to waters, He is\nIndra.  \n7\\. On a high car, O Parvata and Indra, bring pleasant viands, with brave\nheroes, hither!  \nEnjoy our presents, Gods, at sacrifices: wax strong by hymns, rejoice in our\noblation!  \n8\\. In ceaseless flow hath he poured forth his praises, as waters from the\nocean's depth, to Indra,  \nWho to his car on both its sides securely hath fixed the earth and heaven as\nwith an axle.  \n9\\. May our friends turn thee hitherward to friendship! Mayst thou approach us\neven o'er many rivers!  \nMay the Disposer, radiant in this mansion with special lustre, bring the\nfather's offspring!  \n10\\. Who yokes to-day unto the pole of Order the strong and passionate steers\nof checkless spirit,  \nHealth-bringing, bearing in their mouths no fodder? Long shall he live who\nrichly pays their service.\n\n### CHAPTER II\n\n#### DECADE I Indra\n\n1\\. The singers hymn thee, they who chant the psalm of praise are lauding\nthee.  \nThe Brahmans have exalted thee, O Satakratu, like a pole.  \n2\\. All sacred-songs have magnified Indra expansive as the sea,  \nBest of all warriors borne on cars, the Lord of heroes, Lord of strength.  \n3\\. This poured libation, Indra, drink, immortal, gladdening, excellent:  \nStreams of the bright have flowed to thee here at the seat of holy Law.  \n4\\. Stone-darting Indra, wondrous God, what wealth thou hast not given me\nhere,  \nThat bounty, treasure-finder! bring, filling full both thy hands, to us!  \n5\\. O Indra, hear Tiraschi's call, the call of him who serveth thee!  \nSatisfy him with wealth of kine and valiant offspring! Great art thou.  \n6\\. This Soma hath been pressed for thee, O Indra: bold one, mightiest, come!  \nMay Indra-vigour fill thee full, as Surya fills mid-air with rays  \n7\\. Come hither, Indra, with thy bays, come thou to Kanva's eulogy!  \nYe by command of yonder Dyaus, God bright by day! have gone to heaven.  \n8\\. Song-lover! like a charioteer come songs to thee when Soma flows.  \nTogether, they have called to thee as mother-kine unto their calves.  \n9\\. Come now and let us glorify pure Indra with pure Sama hymn!  \nLet milk-blent juice delight him made stronger with pure, pure songs of\npraise!  \n10\\. That which, most wealthy, makes you rich, in splendours most illustrious,  \nSoma is pressed: thy gladdening drink, Indra libation's Lord! is this.\n\n#### DECADE II Indra. Dadhikravan\n\n1\\. Bring forth oblations to the God who knoweth all who fain would drink,  \nThe wanderer, lagging not behind the hero, coming nigh with speed!  \n2\\. To us the mighty, lying in all vital power, who resteth in the deep, who\nstandeth in the east.  \nDrive thou the awful word away.  \n3\\. Even as a car to give us aid, we draw thee nigh to favour us,  \nStrong in thy deeds, quelling attack, Indra, Lord, mightiest! of the brave.  \n4\\. With powers of mighty ones hath he, the friend, the ancient, been\nequipped,  \nThrough whom our father Manu made prayers efficacious with the Gods.  \n5\\. What time the swift and shining steeds, yoked to the chariots, draw them\non,  \nDrinking the sweet delightful juice, there men perform their glorious acts.  \n6\\. Him for your sake I glorify as Lord of Strength who wrongeth none,  \nIndra the hero, mightiest, all-conquering and omniscient.  \n7\\. I with my praise have glorified strong Dadhikravan, conquering steed  \nSweet may he make our mouths: may he prolong the days we have to live!  \n8\\. Render of forts, the young, the wise, of strength unmeasured, was he born,  \nSustainer of each sacred rite, Indra, the Thunderer, much-extolled.\n\n#### DECADE III Indra and others\n\n1\\. Offer the triple sacred draught to Indu hero-worshipper!  \nWith hymn and plenty he invites you to complete the sacrifice.  \n2\\. Those whom they call the attendant pair of Kasyapa who knows the light,  \nLords of each holy duty when the wise have honoured sacrifice.  \n3\\. Sing, sing ye forth your songs of praise, men, Priya-medhas, sing your\nsongs:  \nYea, let young children sing their lauds: yea, glorify our firm stronghold!  \n4\\. To Indra must a laud be said, a joy to him who freely gives,  \nThat Sakra may be joyful in our friendship and the juice we pour.  \n5\\. Your Lord of might that ne'er hath bent, that ruleth over all mankind,  \nI call, that he, as he is wont, may aid the chariots and the men.  \n6\\. Even he who is thine own, through thought of Heaven, of mortal man who\ntoils,  \nHe with the help of lofty Dyaus comes safe through straits of enmity.  \n7\\. Wide, Indra Satakratu, spreads the bounty of thine ample grace:  \nSo, good and liberal giver, known to all men, send us splendid wealth!  \n8\\. Bright Ushas, when thy times return, all quadrupeds and bipeds stir,  \nAnd round about flock winged birds from all the boundaries of heaven.  \n9\\. Ye Gods who yonder have your home amid the luminous realm of heaven,  \nWhat count ye right? what endless life? What is the ancient call on you?  \n10\\. We offer laud and psalm wherewith men celebrate their holy rites.  \nThey govern at the sacred place and bear the sacrifice to Gods.\n\n#### DECADE IV Indra\n\n1\\. Heroes of one accord brought forth and formed for kingship Indra who wins\nthe victory in all encounters,  \nFor power, in firmness, in the field, the great destroyer, fierce and\nexceeding strong,rstalwart and full of vigour.  \n2\\. I trust in thy first wrathful deed, O Indra, when thou slewest Vritra and\ndidst work to profit man;  \nWhen the two world-halves fled for refuge unto thee, and earth even trembled\nat thy strength, O Thunder-armed!  \n3\\. Come all with might together to the Lord of heaven, the only one who is\nindeed the guestof men.  \nHe is the first: to him who fain would come to us all pathways turn; he is in\ntruth the only one.  \n4\\. Thine, Indra, praised of many, excellently rich, are we who trusting in\nthy help draw near to thee.  \nFor none but thou, song-lover, shall receive our lauds: as Earth loves all her\ncreatures, welcome this our hymn!  \n5\\. High hymns have sounded forth the praise of Maghavan, supporter of\nmankind, of Indra meet for lauds;  \nHim who hath waxen mighty, much-invoked with prayers, immortal one whose\npraise each day is sung aloud.  \n6\\. In perfect unison have all your longing hymns that find the light of\nheaven sounded forth Indra's praise.  \nAs wives embrace their lord, the comely bridegroom, so they compass Maghavan\nabout that he may help.  \n7\\. Make glad with songs that Ram whom many men invoke, worthy hymns of\npraise, Indra the sea of wealth;  \nWhose boons spread like the heavens, the - lover of mankind: sing praise to\nhim the Sage, most liberal for our good!  \n8\\. I glorify that Ram who finds the light of heaven, whose hundred strong and\nmighty ones go forth with him.  \nWith prayers may I turn hither Indra to mine aid;-the car which like a swift\nsteed hasteth to the call!  \n9\\. Filled full of fatness, compassing all things that be, wide, spacious,\ndropping meath, beautiful in their form,  \nThe heaven and the earth by Varuna's decree, unwasting, rich in germs, stand\nparted each from each.  \n10\\. As like the Morning, thou hast filled, O Indra, both the earth. and\nheaven,  \nSo as the mighty one, great King of all the mighty race of men, the Goddess\nmother brought thee forth, the blessed mother gave thee life.  \n11\\. Sing, with oblation, praise to him who maketh glad, who with. Rijisvan\ndrove the dusky brood away!  \nLet us, desiring help, call him for friendship, him the strong, the Marut-\ngirt, whose right hand wields the bolt!\n\n#### DECADE V Indra\n\nI. When Somas flow thou makest pure, Indra, thy mind that merits laud  \nFor gain of strength that ever grows: for great is he.  \n2\\. Sing forth to him whom many men invoke, to him whom many laud:  \nInvite the potent Indra with your songs of praise  \n3\\. We sing this strong and wild delight of thine which conquer; in the fray,  \nWhich, Caster of the Stone! gives room and shines like gold,  \n4\\. Whether thou drink the Soma by Vishnu's or Trita Aptya's side,  \nOr with the Maruts, Indra! quaff the following drops.  \n5\\. Come, priest, and of the savoury juice pour forth a yet more gladdening\ndraught:  \nSo is the hero praised who ever prospers us.  \n6\\. Pour out the drops for Indra; let him drink the meath of Soma juice!  \nHe through his majesty sends forth his bounteous gifts.  \n7\\. Come, sing we praise to Indra, friends! the hero who deserves the laud,  \nHim who with none to aid o'ercomes all tribes of men.  \n8\\. Sing ye a psalm to Indra, sing a great song to the lofty Sage,  \nTo him who maketh prayer, inspired who loveth laud!  \n9\\. He who alone bestoweth wealth on mortal man who offereth gifts  \nIs Indra only, potent Lord whom none resist.  \n10\\. Companions, let us learn a prayer to Indra, to the Thunderer,  \nTo glorify your bold and most heroic friend!\n\n## BOOK V\n\n### CHAPTER I\n\n#### DECADE I Indra Adityas\n\n1\\. Indra, this might of thine I praise most highly for the sacrifice  \nThat thou, O Lord of Power, dost slay Vritra with might  \n2\\. For thee this Soma hath been pressed, in whose wild joy thou madest once  \nSambara Divodasa's prey: O Indra, drink!  \n3\\. Come unto us, O Indra, dear, still conquering, unconcealable!  \nWide as a mountain spread on all sides, Lord of heaven!  \n4\\. Joy, mightiest Indra, that perceives, sprung from deep Soma draughts,\nwhereby  \nThou smitest down the greedy fiend,-that joy we crave!  \n5\\. Adityas, very mighty ones, grant to our children and our seed  \nThis lengthened term of life that they may live long days!  \n6\\. Though knowest, Indra, Thunder-armed! how to avoid destructive powers,  \nAs one secure from pitfalls each returning day.  \n7\\. Drive ye disease and strife away, drive ye away malignity:  \nAdityas, keep us far removed from sore distress!  \n8\\. Drive Soma, Indra, Lord of bays! and let it cheer thee: the stone, like a\nwell-guided courser,\n\n#### DECADE II Indra.\n\n1\\. Still, Indra, from all ancient time rivalless ever and companionless art\nthou:  \nThou seekest friendship but in war.  \n2\\. Him who of old hath broucht to us this and that blessing, him I magnify\nfor you,  \nEven Indra, O my friends, for help.  \n3\\. Fail not when marching onward: come hither, like-spirited, stay not far\naway  \nYe who can tame even what is firm!  \n4\\. Come hither to the dropping juice, O Lord of cornland. Lord of horses,\nLord of kine:  \nDrink thou the Soma, Soma's Lord!  \n5\\. Hero, may we, with thee for friend, withstand the man who pants against us\nin his wrath,  \nIn fight with people rich in kine!  \n6\\. Yea, kin by common ancestry, the Maruts, even the oxen, close united\nfriends!  \nAre licking one another's back.  \n7\\. O Indra, bring great strength to us, bring valour, Satakratu, thou most\nactive, bring  \nA hero conquering in war!  \n8\\. So, Indra, friend of song, do we draw nigh to thee with longing; we have\nstreamed to thee  \nComing like floods that follow floods  \n9\\. Sitting like birds beside thy meath, mingled with milk, which gladdeneth\nand exalteth thee,  \nIndra, to thee we sing aloud.  \n10\\. We call on thee, O matchless one! We, seeking help, possessing nothing\nfirm ourselves,  \nCall on thee, wondrous, Thunder-armed.\n\n#### DECADE III Indra\n\n1\\. The juice of Soma thus diffused, sweet to the taste the bright cows drink,  \nWho travelling in splendour close to mighty Indra's side rejoice, good in\ntheir own supremacy.  \n2\\. Thus hath the Soma, gladdening draught, produced the prayer that giveth\njoy:  \nThou, mightiest, Thunder-armed, hast driven by force the Dragon from the\nearth, lauding thine own supremacy.  \n3\\. By men hath Indra been advanced, the Vritra-slayer, to joy and strength.  \nHim only we invoke for help in battles whether great or small: be he our aid\nin deeds of might!  \n4\\. Unconquered strength is only thine, Indra, Stonecaster, Thunder-armed!  \nWhen thou with thy surpassing power smotest to death that guileful beast,\nlauding thine own supremacy.  \n5\\. Go forward, meet the foe, be bold; thy bolt of thunder is not checked!  \nManliness, Indra, is thy strength. Slay Vritra, make the waters thine, lauding\nthine own supremacy!  \n6\\. When war and battles are on foot, booty is offered to the bold.  \nYoke thou thy wildly-rushing bays. Whom wilt thou slay, and whom enrich? Do\nthou, O Indra, make us rich!  \n7\\. Wcll have they eaten and rejoiced; the friends have risen and passed away:  \nThe sages luminous in themselves have praised thee with their latest hymn.\nNow, Indra, yoke thy two bay steeds!  \n8\\. Graciously listen to our songs. Maghavan, be not negligent!  \nWhen wilt thou make us glorious? Make this, only this thine end and aim. Now,\nIndra! yoke thy two bay steeds.  \n9\\. Within the waters runs the Moon, he with the beauteous wings in heaven.  \nYe lightnings with your golden wheels, men find not your abiding-place. Mark\nthis my woe, ye Earth and Sky!  \n10\\. To meet your treasure-bringing car, the mighty car most dear to us.  \nAsvins, the Rishi is prepared, your worshipper, with songs of praise. Lovers\nof sweetness, hear my call!\n\n#### DECADE IV Agni and others.\n\n1\\. O Agni, God, we kindle thee, refulgent, wasting not away,  \nThat this more glorious fuel may send forth for thee its shine to heaven.\nBring food to those who sing thy praise!  \n2\\. With offerings of our own we choose thee, Agni, as our Hotar priest,  \nPiercing and brightly shining-at your glad carouse-served with trimmed grass\nat sacrifice. Thou waxest great.  \n3\\. O heavenly Dawn, awaken us to ample opulence to-day,  \nEven as thou didst waken us with Satyasravas, Vayya's son, high born!\ndelightful with thy steeds!  \n4\\. Send us a mind that brings delight, send energy and mental power.  \nThen-at your glad carouse-let men joy in thy love, sweet juice! as kine in\npasturage. Thou waxest great,  \n5\\. Great, as his nature is, through power, terrible, he hath waxed in\nstrength,  \nLord of bay steeds, strong-jawed, sublime, he in joined hands for glory's sake\nhath grasped his iron thunderbolt.  \n6\\. He, Indra, verily will mount the powerful car that finds the kine,  \nWho thinks upon the well-filled bowl, the tawny coursers' harnesser. Now,\nIndra, yoke thy two bay steeds!  \n7\\. I think of Agni who is kind, whom, as their home, the milch-kine seek:  \nWhom fleet-foot coursers seek as home, and strong enduring steeds as home.\nBring food to those who sing thy praise!  \n8\\. No peril, no severe distress, ye Gods, affects the mortal man  \nWhom Aryaman and Mitra lead, and Varuna, of one accord, beyond his foes.\n\n#### DECADE V Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Flow forth, O Soma, flow thou onward, sweet to Indra's Mitra's, Pushan's,\nBhaga's taste.  \n2\\. Run forth to battle, conquering the Vritras; thou speedest to quell the\nfoes like one exacting debts.  \n3\\. Flow onward, Soma, as a mighty sea, as Father of the Gods, to every form.  \n4\\. Flow onward, Soma, flow for mighty strength, as a strong courser, bathed,\nto win the prize.  \n5\\. Fair Indu hath flowed on for rapturous joy, sage, for good fortune, in the\nwaters' lap.  \n6\\. In thee, effused. O Soma, we rejoice ourselves for great supremacy in\nfight:  \nThou, Pavamana, enterest into mighty deeds.  \n7\\. Who are these radiant men in serried rank, Rudra's young heroes, too, with\nnoble steeds?  \n8\\. Agni, with hymns may we now accomplish that which thou lovest,  \nStrength, like a horse, auspicious strength with service.  \n9\\. The strong youths have come forth to view, to show their strength, God\nSavitar's quickening energy:  \nYe warrior horsemen, win the heavens.  \n10\\. Soma, flow splendid with thy copious stream in due succession through the\nample fleece.\n\n### CHAPTER II\n\n#### DECADE I. Indra\n\n1\\. Giver from all sides, bring to us from every side, thou whom as strongest\nwe entreat!  \n2\\. This Brahman, comer at due time, named Indra, is renowned and praised.  \n3\\. The Brahmans with their hymns exalting Indra increased his strength that\nhe might slaughter Ahi.  \n4\\. Anavas wrought a chariot for thy courser, and Tvashtar, much-invoked! the\nbolt that gitters:  \n5\\. Rest, wealth to him who longs for wealth! the riteless stirs not his love\nnor wins his way to riches.  \n6\\. The cows are ever pure and all-supporting, the Gods are ever free from\nstain and blemish.  \n7\\. With all thy beauty come! The kine approaching with full udders follow on\nthy path.  \n8\\. May we, inhabiting a meath-rich dwelling, increase our wealth, and think\nof thee, O Indra!  \n9\\. The Maruts with fair hymns chant out their praise-song: this Indra, famed\nand youthful, shouts accordant.  \n10\\. Sing to your Indra, mightiest Vritra-slayer, sing to the Sage the song\nthat he accepteth!\n\n#### DECADE II Agni Indra\n\n1\\. Observant Agni hath appeared, oblation-bearer with his car.  \n2\\. O Agni, be our nearest friend, yea, our protector and our kind deliverer!  \n3\\. Like wondrous Bhaga, Agni deals treasure among the mighty.  \n4\\. Far off or present even now, send forth thy shouting first of all!  \n5\\. Dawn drives away her sister's gloom, and through her excellence makes her\nretrace her path.  \n6\\. May we, with Indra and the Gods to aid us, bring these existing worlds to\nfull completion!  \n7\\. Like streams of water on their way, let bounties, Indra, flow from thee!  \n8\\. With this may we obtain strength god-appointed, happy with brave sons\nthrough a hundred winters!  \n9\\. With strength let Mitra, Varuna swell oblations; do thou prepare for us\nrich food, O Indra!  \n10\\. Indra is King of all the world.\n\n#### DECADE III Indra and others\n\n1\\. At the Trikadrukas the great and strong enjoyed the barley-brew. With\nVishnu did he drink the pressed-out Soma juice, even as he would.  \nThat hath so heightened him the great, the wide to do his mighty work. So did\nthe God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true.  \n2\\. This God who sees for thousands of mankind, the light, the thought of\npoets, and the Law,  \nThe brilliant one, hath sent forth hither all the Dawns: spotless, one-minded,\nzealous in their home they dwell, with thought upon the Steer.  \n3\\. Come to us, Indra, from afar, conducting us, as, to the gatherings, a Lord\nof heroes, as an archer King, the heroes' Lord!  \nWe come with gifts of pleasant food, with flowing juice, invoking thee, as\nsons invite a sire, that we may win the spoil, thee, bounteousest, for gain of\nspoil.  \n4\\. Loudly I call that Indra Maghavan, the mighty, resistless, evermore\npossessing many glories.  \nHoly, most liberal, may he lead us on to riches, through songs, and, thunder-\narmed make all our pathways pleasant!  \n5\\. Heard be our prayer! In thought I honour Agni first: now straightway we\nelect this heavenly company, Indra and Vayu we elect.  \nFor when our latest thought is raised and on Vivasvan centred well, then do\nour holy songs go forward on their way, our songs as 'twere unto the Gods.  \n6\\. To Vishnu, to the mighty whom the Maruts follow, let your hymns born in\nsong go forth, Evayamarut!  \nTo the strong, very holy band adorned with bracelets, that rushes on in joy\nand ever roars for vigour!  \n7\\. With this his golden splendour purifying him, be with his own allies\nsubdues all enemies, as Sura with his own allies.  \nCleansing himself with stream of juice he shines forth yellow-hued and red,\nwhen with the praisers he encompasses all, forms, with praisers having seven\nmouths.  \n8\\. I praise this God, parent of heaven and earth, exceeding wise, possessed\nof real energy, giver of treasure, thinker dear to all,  \nWhose splendour is sublime, whose light shone brilliant in, creation, who,\nwise and golden-handed, in his beauty mader the sky.  \n9\\. Agni I deem our Hotar-priest, munificent wealth-giver, Son of Strength,\nwho, knoweth all that is, even as the Sage who, knoweth all.  \nLord of fair rites, a God with form erected turning to the Gods, he, when the\nflame hath sprung forth from the holy oil, the offered fatness, longs for it\nas it glows bright.  \n10\\. This, Indra! dancer! was thy hero deed, thy first and ancient work,\nworthy to be told forth in heaven,  \nEven thine who furtheredst life with a God's own power, freeing the floods.\nAll that is godless may he conquer with his might, and, Lord of Hundred\nPowers, find for us strength and food!\n\n#### DECADE IV Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. High is thy juice's birth: though set it heaven, on earth it hath obtained\ndread sheltering power and great renown.  \n2\\. In sweetest and most gladdening stream flow pure, O Soma, on thy way,\npressed out for Indra, for his drink!  \n3\\. Flow onward mighty with thy stream, inspiriting the Maruts' Lord, winning\nall riches with thy power!  \n4\\. Flow onward with that juice of thine most excellent, that brings delight,\nslaying the wicked, dear to Gods!  \n5\\. Three several words are uttered: kine are lowing, cows who give the milk;\nthe tawny-hued goes bellowing on.  \n6\\. For Indra girt by Maruts, flow, thou Indu, very rich in meath, to seat\nthee in the place of song!  \n7\\. Strong, mountain-born, the stalk hath been pressed in the streams for\nrapturous joy. Hawk-like he settles in his home.  \n8\\. Gold-hued! as one who giveth strength flow on for Gods to drink, a draught\nfor Vayu and the Marut host!  \n9\\. Soma, the dweller on the hills, effused, hath flowed into the sieve. All-\nbounteous art thou in carouse.  \n10\\. The Sage of heaven whose heart is wise, when laid between both hands,\nwith roars, gives us delightful powers of life.\n\n#### DECADE V Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The rapture-shedding Somas have flowed forth in our assembly, pressed to\nglorify our liberal lords.  \n2\\. The Somas, skilled in song, the waves, have led the water forward, like\nbuffaloes speeding to the woods.  \n3\\. Indu flow on, a mighty juice; glorify us among the folk: drive all our\nenemies away!  \n4\\. For thou art strong by splendour: we, O Pavamana, call on thee, the\nbrilliant looker on the light.  \n5\\. Indu, enlightener, dear, the thought of poets, hath flowed clearly, like a\ncharioteer who starts the steed.  \n6\\. Through our desire of heroes, kine, and horses, potent Soma drops,\nbrilliant and swift, have been effused.  \nGod, working with mankind, flow on; to Indra go thy gladdening juice: to Vayu\nmount as Law commands!  \nFrom heaven hath Pavamana made, as 'twere, the marvellous thunder, and the\nlofty light of all mankind.  \n9\\. Pressed for the gladdening draught the drops flow forth abundantly with\nsong, flow onward with the stream of meath.  \n10\\. Reposing on the river's wave, the Sage hath widely flowed around, bearing\nthe bard whom many love.\n\n## BOOK VI\n\n### CHAPTER I\n\n#### DECADE I Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The Gods have come to Indu well-descended, beautified with milk, the\nactive crusher of the foe.  \n2\\. Active, while being purified, he hath assailed all enemies: they deck the\nSage with holy hymns.  \n3\\. Pouring all glories hither, he, effused, hath passed within the jar: Indu\non Indra is bestowed.  \n4\\. From the two press-boards is the juice sent, like a car-horse, to the\nsieve: the steed steps forward to the goal.  \n5\\. Impetuous, bright, have they come forth, unwearied in their speed, like\nbulls, driving the black skin far away.  \n6\\. Soma, thou flowest chasing foes, finder of wisdom and delight: drive thou\nthe godless folk afar!  \nFlow onward with that stream wherewith thou gavest splendour to the Sun,\nspeeding the waters kind to man!  \n8\\. Flow onward thou who strengthenedst Indra to slaughter Vritra who\ncompassed and stayed the mighty floods!  \n9\\. Flow onward, Indu, with this food for him who in thy wild delights\nbattered the nine-and-ninety down!  \n10\\. Flow, pressed, into the filter, speed the heavenly one who winneth\nwealth, who bringeth booty through our juice!\n\n#### DECADE II Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The tawny Bull hath bellowed, fair as mighty Mitra to behold: he gleams\nand flashes with the Sun.  \n2\\. We choose to-day that chariot-steed of thine, the strong, that brings us\nbliss, the guardian, the desire of all.  \n3\\. Adhvaryu, to the filter lead the Soma juice expressed with stones: make\nthou it pure for Indra's drink.  \n4\\. Swift runs this giver of delight, even the stream of flowingjuice: Swift\nruns this giver of delight.  \n5\\. Pour hitherward, O Soma, wealth in thousands and heroic strength, and keep\nrenown secure for us!  \n-6. The ancient living ones have come unto a newer resting-place. They made the Sun that he might shine.  \n7\\. Soma, flow on exceeding bright with loud roar to the reservoirs, resting\nin wooden vats, thy home!  \n8\\. O Soma, thou, art strong and bright, potent, O God, with potent sway:\nthou, mighty one, ordainest laws.  \n9\\. For food, flow onward with thy stream, cleansed and made bright by sapient\nmen: Indu. with sheen approach the milk!  \n10\\. Soma, flow on with pleasant stream, strong and devoted to the Gods, our\nfriend, unto the woollen sieve.  \n11\\. By this solemnity, Soma, thou, though great, hast been increased: in joy\nthou, verily actest like a bull!  \n12\\. Most active and benevolent, this Pavamana sent to us for lofty friendship\nmeditates.  \n13\\. Indu, to us for this great rite, bearing as 'twere thy wave to Gods,\nunwearied, thou art flowing on.  \n14\\. Chasing our foemen, driving off the godless, Soma floweth on, going to\nIndra's settled place.\n\n#### DECADE III Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Cleansing thee, Soma, in thy stream, thou flowest in a watery robe: giver\nof wealth, thou sittest in the place of Law, O God, a fountain made of gold.  \n2\\. Hence sprinkle forth the juice effused, Soma, the best of sacred gifts,\nwho, friend of man, hath run amid the water-streams! He hath pressed Soma out\nwith stones.  \n3\\. Expressed by stones, O Soma, and urged through the long wool of the sheep,\nthou, entering the press-boards even as men a fort, gold-hued hast settled in\nthe vats.  \n4\\. O Soma,--for the feast of Gods, river-like he hath swelled with surge,\nsweet with the liquor of the stalk, as one who wakes, into the vat that drops\nwith meath.  \n5\\. Pressed out by pressers, Soma goes over the fleecy backs of sheep, goes,\neven as with a mare, in tawny-coloured stream, goes in a sweetly-sounding\nstream.  \n6\\. O Soma, Indu, every day thy friendship hath been my delight. Many fiends\nfollow me help me, thou tawny-hued: pass on beyond these barriers!  \n7\\. Deft-handed! thou when purified liftest thy voice amid the sea. Thou,\nPavamana, makest riches flow to us, yellow, abundant, much desired.  \n8\\. The living drops of Soma juice pour, as they flow, the gladdening drink,\nintelligent drops above the station of the sea, exhilarating, dropping meath.  \n9\\. Soma, while thou art cleansed, most dear and watchful in the sheep's long\nwool, most like to Angiras! thou hast become a sage. Sprinkle our sacrifice\nwith mead!  \n10\\. Soma, the gladdening juice, flows pressed for Indra with his Marut host:\nhe hastens o'er the fleece with all his thousand streams: him, him the men\nmake pure and bright.  \n11\\. Flow on, best winner of the spoil, to precious gifts of every sort! Thou\nart a sea according to the highest law, joy-giver, Soma! to the Gods  \n12\\. Over the cleansing sieve have flowed the Pavamanas in a stream, girt by\nthe Maruts, gladdening, steeds with Indra's strength, for wisdom and for\ndainty food.\n\n#### DECADE IV Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Run onward to the reservoir and seat thee: cleansed by the men speed\nforward to the battle!  \nMaking thee glossy like an able courser, forth to the sacred grass with reins\nthey lead thee.  \n2\\. The God declares the deities' generations, like Uaana, proclaiming lofty\nwisdom.  \nWith brilliant kin, far-ruling, sanctifying, the wild boar, singing with his\nfoot, advances.  \n3\\. Three are the voices that the car-steed utters: he speaks the lore of\nprayer, the thought of Order.  \nTo the cows' master come the cows inquiring: the hymns with eager longing come\nto Soma.  \n4\\. Made pure by this man's urgent zeal and impulse, the God hath with his\njuice the Gods pervaded.  \nPressed, singing, to the sieve he goes, as passes the Hotar to enclosures\nholding cattle.  \n5\\. Father of holy hymns Soma flows onward, the father of the earth, father of\nheaven;  \nFather of Agni, Surya's generator, the father who begat Indra and Vishnu  \n6\\. To him, praiseworthy, sacred tones have sounded, Steer of the triple\nheight, the life-bestower.  \nDwelling in wood, like Varuna, a river, lavishing treasure, he distributes\nblessings.  \n7\\. Guard of all being, generating creatures, loud roared the sea as highest\nlaw commanded.  \nStrong, in the filter, on the fleecy summit, pressed from the stone, Soma hath\nwaxen mighty.  \n8\\. Loud neighs the tawny steed when started, settling deep in the wooden\nvessel while they cleanse him.  \nLed by the men he makes the milk his raiment; then shall he, of himself,\nengender worship.  \n9\\. This thine own Soma, rich in meath, O Indra, the Strong, hath flowed into\nthe Strong One's filter.  \nThe swift steed, bounteous, giving hundreds, thousands, hath reached the\nsacred grass which never fails him.  \n10\\. Flow onward, Soma, rich in meath, and holy, enrobed in waters, on the\nfleecy summit!  \nSettle in vessels that are full of fatness, as cheering and most gladdening\ndrink for Indra!\n\n#### DECADE V Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. In forefront of the cars forth goes the hero, the leader, seeking spoil:\nhis host rejoices.  \nSoma endues his robe of lasting colours, and blesses, for his friends, their\ncalls on Indra.  \n2\\. Thy streams have been poured forth with all their sweetness, when,\ncleansed thou passest through the woollen filter.  \nThe race of kine thou cleansest, Pavamana! Thou didst beget: and speed the Sun\nwith splendours.  \n3\\. Let us sing praises to the Gods: sing loudly, send ye the Soma forth for\nmighty riches!  \nLet him flow, sweetly-flavoured, through the filter: let the God Indu settle\nin the beaker!  \n4\\. Urged on, the father of the earth and heaven hath gone forth like a car to\ngather booty.  \nGoing to Indra, sharpening his weapons, and in his hands containing every\ntreasure.  \n5\\. When, by the law of the Most High, in presence of heaven and earth, the\nfond mind's utterance formed him.  \nThen, loudly lowing, came the cows to Indu, the chosen, wellloved master in\nthe beaker.  \n6\\. Ten sisters, pouring out the rain together, the sage's quickly-moving\nthoughts, adorn him.  \nHither hath run the gold-hued child of Surya, and reached the vat like a fleet\nvigorous courser.  \n7\\. When beauties strive for him as for a charger, then strive the songs as\npeople for the sunlight.  \nA mighty Sage, he flows enrobed in waters and hymns as 'twree a stall that\nkine may prosper.  \n8\\. Strong Indu, bathed in milk, flows on for Indra, Soma exciting, strength,\nfor his carousal.  \nHe quells malignity and slays the demons, King of the homestead, he who gives\nus comfort.  \n9\\. Pour forth this wealth with this purification: flow onward to the yellow\nlake, O Indu!  \nHere, too, the bright one, wind-swift, full of wisdom, shall give a son to him\nwho cometh quickly.  \n10\\. Soma, the mighty, when, the waters' offspring, he chose the Gods,\nperformed that great achievement.  \nHe, Pavamana, granted strength to Indra: he, Indu, generated light in Surya.  \n11\\. As for a chariot-race, the skilful speaker, first hymn, inventor, hath\nwith song been started.  \nThe sisters ten upon the fleecy summit adorn the car-horse in the resting-\nplaces.  \n12\\. Hastening onward like the waves of waters our holy hymns are coming forth\nto Soma.  \nTo him they go with lowly adoration, and, longing, enter him who longs to meet\nthem.\n\n### CHAPTER II\n\n#### DECADE I Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. For first possession of your juice. for the exhilarating drink,  \nDrive ye away the dog, my friends, drive ye the long-tongued dog away!  \n2\\. As Pushan. Fortune, Bhaga, comes this Soma while they make him pure.  \nHe, Lord of all the multitude, hath looked upon the earth and heaven.  \n3\\. The Somas, very rich in sweets, for which the sieve is destined,. flow  \nEffused, the source of Indra's joy: may your strong juices reach the Gods!  \n4\\. For us the Soma juices flow, the drops best furtherers of weal,  \nEffused as friends, without a spot, benevolent, finders of the. light.  \n5\\. Stream on us riches that are craved by hundreds, best at winning spoil,  \nRiches, O Indu, thousandfold, most splendid, that surpass the light!  \n6\\. The guileless ones are singing praise to Indra's well-beloved friend,  \nAs, in the morning of its life, the mothers lick the new-born calf.  \n7\\. They for the bold and lovely one ply manly vigour like a bow;  \nBright, glad, in front of songs they spread to form a vesture for the Lord.  \n8\\. Him with ths fleece they purify, brown, golden-hued, beloved of all,  \nWho with exhilarating juice goes forth to all the deities.  \n9\\. Let him, as mortal, crave this speech, for him who presses, of the juice,  \nAs Bhrigu's sons chased Makha, so drive ye the niggard hound away!\n\n#### DECADE II Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Graciously-minded he is flowing on his way to win dear names o'er which\nthe youthful one grows great.  \nThe mighty and far-seeing one hath mounted now the mighty Surya's car which\nmoves to every side.  \n2\\. Spontaneous let our drops of Soma juice flow on, pressed out and tawny-\ncoloured, mightily, to the Gods!  \nStill let our enemies, the godless, be in want, though filled with food; and\nlet our prayers obtain success!  \n3\\. Most beauteous of the beauteous, Indra's thunderbolt, this Soma, rich in\nsweets, hath clamoured in the vat.  \nDropping with oil, abundant, streams of sacrifice flow unto him, and milch-\nkine, lowing, with their milk.  \n4\\. Indu hath started forth for Indra's settled place, and slights not, as a\nfriend, the promise of his friend.  \nSoma comes onward like a youth with youthful maids, and gains the beaker by a\ncourse of hundred paths.  \n5\\. On flows the potent juice, sustainer of the heavens; the strength of Gods,\nwhom men must hail with shouts of joy.  \nThou, gold-hued, started like a courser by brave men, art lightly showing\nforth thy splendour in the streams.  \n6\\. Far-seeing Soma flows, the Steer, the Lord of hymns, the furtherer of\ndays, of mornings, and of heaven.  \nBreath of the rivers, he hath roared into the jars, and with the help of sages\nentered Indra's heart.  \n7\\. The three-times seven milch-kine in the loftiest heaven have for this Soma\npoured the genuine milky draught.  \nFour other beauteous creatures hath he made for his adornment when he waxed in\nstrength through holy rites.  \n8\\. Flow on to indra, Soma, carefully effused: let sickness stay afar together\nwith the fiend!  \nLet not the double-tongued delight them with thy juice: here be thy flowing\ndrops laden with opulence!  \n9\\. Even as a King hath Soma, red and tawny Bull, been pressed: the wondrous\none hath bellowed to the kine.  \nWhile purified thou passest through the filtering fleece to seat thee hawk-\nlike on the place that drops with oil.  \n10\\. The drops of Soma juice, like cows who yield their milk, have flowed\nforth, rich in meath, unto the diety,  \nAnd, seated on the grass, raising their voice, assumed the milk, the covering\nrobe wherewith the address stream.  \n11\\. They balm him, balm him over, balm him thoroughly, caress the mighty\nstrength and balm it with the meath.  \nThey seize the flying Steer at the stream's breathing-place: cleansing with\ngold they grasp the animal herein.  \n12\\. Spread is thy cleansing filter, Brahmanaspati: as prince thou enterest\nits limbs from every side.  \nThe raw, whose mass hath not been heated, gains not this: they only which are\ndressed, which bear, attain to it.\n\n#### DECADE III Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. To Indra, to the mighty one, let these gold-coloured juices go,  \nDrops born as Law prescribes, that find the light of heavenj  \n2\\. Flow vigilant for Indra, thou Soma, yea, Indu, run thou forth;  \nBring hither splendid strength that finds the light of heaven!  \n3\\. Sit down, O friends, and sing aloud to him who purifies himself.  \nDeck him for glory, like a child, with holy rites!  \n4\\. Friends, hymn your Lord who makes him pure for rapturous  \ncarouse: let them  \nSweeten him, as a child, with lauds and sacred gifts!  \n5\\. Breath of the mighty Dames, the Child, speeding the plan of' sacrifice,  \nSurpasses all things that are dear, yea, from of old!  \n6\\. In might, O Indu, with thy streams flow for the banquet of the Gods:  \nRich in meath, Soma, in our beaker take thy seat!  \n7\\. Soma, while filtered, with his wave flows through the long wool of the\nsheep,  \nRoaring, while purified, before the voice of song.  \n8\\. The speech is uttered for the Sage, for Soma being purified:  \nBring meed as 'twere to one who makes thee glad with hymns!  \n9\\. Flow to us, Indu, very strong, effused, with wealth of kine and, steeds,  \nAnd do thou lay above the milk thy radiant hue!  \n10\\. Voices have sung aloud to thee as finder-out of wealth for us:  \nWe clothe the hue thou wearest with a robe of milk.  \n11\\. Gold-hued and lovely in his course through tangles of the wooli he flows:  \nStream forth heroic fame upon the worshippers!  \n12\\. On through the long wool of the sheep to the meath-dropping vat he flows:  \nThe Rishis' sevenfold quire hath sung aloud to him.\n\n#### DECADE IV Soma Pavamana\n\nI. For Indra flow, thou Soma, on, as most inspiring drink, exceeding rich in\nsweets.  \nGreat, most celestial, gladdening drink!  \n2\\. Make high and splendid glory shine hitherward, Lord of food, God, on the\nfriend of Gods:  \nUnclose the cask of middle air!  \n3\\. Press ye and pour him, like a steed, laud-worthy, speeding through the\nregion and the flood,  \nWho swims in water, dwells in wood!  \n4\\. Him, even this Steer who milks the heavens, him with a thousand streams,\ndistilling rapturous joy,  \nHim who brings all things excellent.  \n5\\. Effused is he who brings good things, who brings us store of' wealth and\nsweet refreshing food,  \nSoma who brings us quiet homes.  \n6\\. For, verily, Pavamana, thou, divine! endued with brightest splendour\ncalling all  \nCreatures to immortality.  \n7\\. Effused, he floweth in a stream, best rapture-giver, in the longwool of\nthe sheep,  \nSporting, as 'twere the waters' wave.  \n8\\. He who from out the rocky cavern with his might took forth the red-\nrefulgent cows--  \nThou drewest to thyself the stall of kine and steeds: burst it,  \nbrave Lord, like one in mail; yea, burst it, O brave Lord, like one in mail!\n\n# PART SECOND\n\n## BOOK I\n\n### CHAPTER I\n\nOm. Glory to the Samaveda! to Lord Ganesa glory! Om.\n\n#### I Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Sing forth to Indu, O ye men, to him who now is purified,  \nFain to pay worship to the Gods!  \n2, Together with thy pleasant juice the Atharvans have commingled. milk.  \nDivine, God-loving, for the God.  \n3\\. Bring health to cattle with thy flow, health to the people, health, to\nsteeds,  \nHealth, O thou King, to growing plants!\n\n#### II Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Bright are these Somas blent with milk, with light that flashes\nbrilliantly,  \nAnd form that shouteth all around.  \n2\\. Roused by his drivers and sent forth, the strong Steed hath come: nigh for\nspoil,  \nAs warriors when they stand arrayed.  \n3\\. Specially, Soma, Sage, by day, coming together for our weal,  \nLike Surya, flow for us to see!\n\n#### III Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The streams of Pavamana, thine, Sage, mighty one, have poured them forth,  \nLike coursers eager for renown.  \n2\\. They have been poured upon the Reece towards the meath-distilling vat:  \nThe holy songs have rung aloud.  \n3\\. Like milch-kine coming home, the drops of Soma juice have reached the\nlake,  \nHave reached the shrine of sacrifice\n\n#### IV Agni\n\n1\\. Come, Agni, praised with song to feast and sacrificial offerings: sit  \nAs Hotar on the holy grass!  \n2\\. So, Angiras, we make thee strong with fuel and with holy oil.  \nBlaze high, thou youngest of the Gods!  \n3\\. For us thou winnest, Agni, God, heroic strength exceeding great, Far-\nspreading and of high renown.\n\n#### V Mitra Varuna\n\n1\\. Varuna, Mitra, sapient pair, pour fatness on our pastures, pour  \nMeath on the regions of the air!  \n2, Gladdened by homage, ruling far, ye reign by majesty of might,  \nPure in your ways, for evermore.  \n3\\. Lauded by Jamadagni's song, sit in the shrine of sacrifice:  \nDrink Soma, ye who strengthen Law!\n\n#### VI Indra\n\n1\\. Come, we have pressed theJuice for thee; O Indra, drink this Soma here:  \nSit thou on this my sacred grass!  \n2\\. O Indra, let thy long-maned bays, yoked by prayer, bring thee hitherward!  \nGive ear and listen to our prayers!  \n3\\. We Soma-bearing Brahmans call thee Soma-drinker with thy friend,  \nWe, Indra, bringing Soma juice.\n\n#### VII Indra Agni\n\n1\\. Indra and Agni, moved by songs, come to the juice, the precious dew:  \nDrink ye thereof, impelled by prayer!  \n2\\. Indra and Agni, with the man who lauds comes visible sacrifice:  \nSo drink ye both this flowing juice!  \n3\\. With force of sacrifice I seek Indra, Agni who love the wise:  \nWith Soma let them sate them here!\n\n#### VIII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. High is thy juice's birth: though set in heaven, on earth it hath obtained  \nDread sheltering power and great renown.  \n2\\. Finder of room and freedom, flow for Indra whom we must adore,  \nFor Varuna and the Marut host!  \n3\\. Striving to win, with him we gain all riches from the enemy,  \nYea, all the glories of mankind,\n\n#### IX Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Cleansing thee, Soma, in thy stream, thou flowest in watery robe.  \nGiver of wealth, thou sittest in the place of Law, O God, a fountain made of\ngold.  \n2\\. He, milking for dear meath the heavenly udder, hath sat in the ancient\ngathering-place.  \nWashed by the men, far-sighted, strong, thou streamest to ther honourable\nreservoir.\n\n#### X Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Run onward to the reservoir and seat thee: cleansed by the men speed\nforward to the battle.  \nMaking thee glossy like an able courser, forth to the sacred grass with reins\nthey lead thee.  \n2\\.

Like kine unmilked we call aloud, hero, to thee, and sing thy  \npraise,  \nLooker on heavenly light, Lord of this moving world, Lord, Indra! of what\nmoveth not.  \n2\\. None other like to thee, of earth or of the heavens, hath been or ever\nwill be born.  \nDesiring horses, Indra Maghavan! and kine, as men of might we call on thee.\n\n#### XII Indra\n\n1\\. With what help will he come to us, wonderful, everwaxing friend?  \nWith what most mighty company?  \n2\\.

For first possession of your juice, for the exhilarating drink,  \nDrive ye away the dog, my friends, drive ye the long-tongued dog away!  \n2\\.

Graciously- minded he is flowing on his way to win dear names o'er which\nthe youthful one grows great.  \nThe mighty and far-seeing one hath mounted now the mighty  \nSurya's car which moves to every side.  \n2\\. The speaker, unassailable master of this prayer, the tongue of sacrifice,\npours forth the pleasant meath.  \nAs son be sets the name of mother and of sire in the far distance, in the\nthird bright realm of heaven.  \n3\\. Sending forth flashes he hath bellowed to the jars, led by the men into\nthe golden reservoir.  \nThe milkers of the sacrifice have sung to him: Lord of three heights, thou\nshinest brightly o'er the Dawns.\n\n#### XX Agni\n\n1\\.

So, Indra, friend of song, do we draw near to thee with longing; we have\nstreamed to thee  \nComing like floods that follow floods.  \n2\\. As rivers swell the ocean, so, hero, our prayers increase thy might,  \nThough of thyself, O Thunderer, waxing day by day.  \n3\\. With holy song they bind to the broad wide-yoked car the bay steeds of the\nquickening God,  \nBearers of Indra, yoked by word.\n\n### CHAPTER II\n\n#### I Indra\n\nI. Invite ye Indra with a song to drink your draught of Soma juicel  \nAll-conquering Satakratu, most munificent of all who live!  \n2\\.

This, even this, O Indra, we implore: as thy devoted friends,  \nThe Kanvas praise thee with their hymns.  \n2\\. Naught else, O Thunderer, have I praised in the skilled singer's eulogy;  \nOn thy laud only have I thought.  \n3\\. The Gods seek him who presses out the Soma; they desire not sleep:  \nThey punish sloth unweariedly\n\n#### IV Indra\n\n1\\. For Indra, lover of carouse, loud be our songs about the juice:  \nLet poets sing the song of praise  \n2\\. We summon Indra to the draught, in whom all glories rest, in whom  \nThe seven communities rejoice.  \n3\\. At the Trikadrukas the Gods span sacrifice that stirs the mind:  \nLet our songs aid and prosper it!\n\n#### V Indra\n\n1\\. Here, Indra, is thy Soma draught, made pure upon the sacred grass:  \nRun hither, come and drink thereof!  \n2\\.

Hero when thou wouldst give thy gifts, neither the Gods nor mortal men  \nRestrain thee like a fearful bull.\n\n**\n\nVII Indra\n\n**\n\n1\\. Hero, the Soma being shed, I pour the juice for thee to drink:  \nSate thee and finish thy carouse!  \n2\\. Let not the fools, or those who mock, beguile thee when they seek thine\naid:  \nLove not the enemy of prayer!  \n3\\. Here let them cheer thee well supplied with milk to great munificence:  \nDrink as the wild bull drinks the lake!\n\n#### VIII lndra\n\nI. Here is the Soma juice expressed: O Vasu, drink till thou art full!  \nUndaunted God, we give it thee!  \n2\\. Washed by the men, pressed out with stones, strained through the filter\nmade of wool,  \n'Tis like a courser bathed in streams.  \n3\\. This juice have we made sweet for thee like barley, blending it with milk.  \nIndra, I call thee to our feast.\n\n#### IX Indra\n\n1\\. So, Lord of affluent gifts, this juice hath been expressed for thee with\nstrength:  \nDrink of it, thou who lovest song!  \n2\\.

O Indra, let it enter both thy flanks, enter thy head with prayer,  \nWith bounty, hero! both thine arms!\n\n#### X Indra\n\n1\\. O Come ye hither, sit ye down; to Indra sing ye forth your song,  \nCompanions, bringing hymns of praise,  \n2\\.

May he stand near us in our need with all abundance, for our wealth:  \nWith strength may he come nigh to us!\n\n#### XI Indra\n\n1\\. In every need, in every fray we call, as friends to succour us,  \nIndra, the mightiest of all.  \n2\\. I call him, mighty to resist, the hero of our ancient home,  \nThee whom my sire invoked of old.  \n3\\. If he will hear us, let him come with succour of a thousand kinds,  \nWith strength and riches, to our call!\n\n#### XI Indra\n\n1\\. When Somas flow thou makest pure, Indra, thy mind that merits laud,  \nFor gain of strength that ever grows: for great is he.  \n2\\. In heaven's first region, in the seat of Gods, is he who brings success,  \nMost glorious, prompt to save, who wins the waterfloods.  \n3\\. Him I invoke, to win the spoil, even mighty Indra for the fray.  \nBe thou most near to us for bliss, a friend to aid!\n\n#### XIII Agni\n\n1\\. With this mine homage I invoke Agni for you, the Son of Strength.  \nDear, wisest envoy, skilled in noble sacrifice, immortal, messanger of all.  \n2\\. His two red horses, all-supporting, let him yoke: let him, well-\nworshipped, urge them fast!  \nThen hath the sacrifice good prayers and happy end, the heavenly gift of\nwealth to men.\n\n#### XIV Dawn\n\n1\\. Advancing, sending forth her rays, the daughter of the Sky is seen.  \nThe mighty one lays bare the darkness with her eye, the friendly Lady makes\nthe light.  \n2\\. The Sun ascending, the refulgent star, pours down his beams. together with\nthe Dawn.  \nO Dawn, at thine arising, and, the Sun's, may we attain the share allotted us!\n\n#### XV Asvins\n\n1\\. These morning sacrifices call you, Asvins, at the break of day.  \nFor help have I invoked you rich in power and might: for, house by house, ye\nvisit all.  \n2\\. Ye, heroes, have bestowed wonderful nourishment: send it to him whose\nsongs are sweet.  \nOne-minded, both of you, drive your car down to us: drink yethe savoury Soma\njuice!\n\n#### XVI Soma Pavamana.\n\n1\\. After his ancient splendour, they, the bold, have drawn the bright milk\nfrom  \nThe Sage who wins a thousand spoils.  \n2\\. In aspect he is like the Sun: he runneth forward to the lakes: Seven\ncurrents flowing to the sky.  \n3\\.

Father of holy hymns, Soma flows onward, the father of the earth, father\nof heaven.  \nFather of Agni, Surya's generator, the father who begat Indra and Vishnu.  \n2\\. Brahman of Gods, the leader of the poets, Rishi of sages, chief of savage\ncreatures,  \nFalcon amid the vultures, axe of forests, over the cleansing sieve goes Soma\nsinging.  \n3\\. He, Soma Pavamana, like a river, hath stirred the wave of voice, our songs\nand praises  \nBeholding these inferior powers, the hero, well knowing, takes his stand among\nthe cattle.\n\n#### XX Agni\n\nI. Hither, for powerful kinship, I call Agni, him who prospers you,  \nMost frequent at our solemn rites.  \n2\\. That through this famed one's power he may stand by us, even as Tvasbtar\ncomes  \nUnto the forms that must be shaped.  \n3\\. This Agni is the Lord supreme above all glories' mid the Gods:  \nMay he come nigh to us with strength.\n\n#### XXI Indra\n\n1\\. This poured libation, Indra drink, immortal, gladdening, excellent!  \nStreams of the bright have flowed to thee here at the seat of holy Law.  \n2\\. When, Indra, thou dost guide thy bays, there is no better charioteer:  \nNone hath surpassed thee in thy might, none with good steeds o'ertaken thee.  \n3\\. Sing glory now to Indra, say to him your solemn eulogies!  \nThe drops poured forth have made him glad: pay reverence to his noblest might!\n\n#### XII Indra\n\n1\\. Indra, be pleased: drive forward, hero, striker of thy bays!  \nFair, like a sage, delighting in the meath, drink of the juice for rapturous\njoy.  \n2\\. O Indra, fill thy belly anew with meath that seems to flow from heaven.  \nThe sweet-voiced raptures of this juice have come, as 'twere to heaven. to\nthee.  \n3\\. Indra, victorious, Mitra-like, smote, like a Yati, Vritra dead.  \nAs Bhrigu quelled his foes, he cleft Vala in Soma's rapturous joy.\n\n### CHAPTER II\n\n#### I Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Winner of gold and gear and cattle flow thou on, set as impregner, Indu!\n'mid the worlds of life!  \nRich in brave men art thou, Soma, who winnest all: these holy singers wait\nupon thee with song.  \n2\\. O Soma, thou beholdest men from every side: O Pavamana, Steer, thou\nwanderest through these.  \nPour out upon us wealth in treasure and in gold: may we have strength to live\namong the things that be!  \n3\\. Thou passest to these worlds as sovran Lord thereof, O Indu, harnessing\nthy tawny well-winged mares.  \nMay they pour forth for thee milk and oil rich in sweets:  \nO Soma, let the folk abide in thy decree!\n\n#### II Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The streams of Pavamana, thine, finder of all I have been ettused,  \nEven as Surya's rays of light.  \n2\\. Making the light that shines from heaven thou flowest on to every form,  \nSoma, thou swellest like a sea.  \n3\\. Shown forth thou sendest out thy voice, O Pavamana, with a roar.  \nLike Surya, God, as Law commands.\n\n#### III Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Hitherward have the Somas streamed, the drops while they are purified:  \nWhen blent, in waters they are raised.  \n2\\. The milk hath run to meet them like floods rushing down a precipice:  \nThey come to Indra, being cleansed.  \n3\\. O Soma Pavamana, thou flowest as Indra's gladdener: The men have seized\nand lead thee forth.  \n4\\. Thou, Indu, when, expressed by stones, thou runnest to the filter, art  \nReady for Indra's high decree.  \n5\\. Victorious, to be hailed with joy, O Soma, flow delighting men,  \nAs the supporter of mankind!  \n6\\. Flow on, best Vritra-slayer; flow meet to be hailed with joyful lauds,  \npure, purifying, wonderful  \n7\\. Pure, purifying, is he called, Soma effused and full of sweets,  \nSlayer of sinners, dear to Gods.\n\n#### IV Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The Sage hath robed him in the sheep's wool for the banquet of the Gods,  \nSubduing all our enemies.  \n2\\. For he, as Pavamana, sends thousandfold riches in the shape  \nOf cattle to the worshippers.  \n3\\. Thou graspest all things with thy mind, and purifiest thee with thoughts:  \nAs such, O Soma, find us fame!  \n4\\. Pour on us lofty glory, send sure riches to our liberal lords:  \nBring food to those who sing thy praise!  \n5\\. As thou art cleansed, O wondrous steed, O Soma, thou hast entered, like  \nA pious king, into the songs,  \n6\\. He, Soma, like a courser in the floods invincible, made bright  \nWith hands, is resting in the press.  \n7\\. Disporting, like a liberal chief, thou goest. Soma to the sieve,  \nLending the laud heroic strength.\n\n#### V Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Pour on us with thy juice all kinds of corn, each sort of nourishment!  \nAnd, Soma, all felicities!  \n2\\. As thine, O Indu, is the praise, and thine what springeth from, the juice,  \nSeat thee on the dear sacred grass!  \n3\\. And, finding for us steeds and kine, O Soma, with thy juice flow on  \nThrough days that fly most rapidly!  \n4\\. As one who conquers, ne'er subdued, attacks and slays the enemy,  \nThus, vanquisher of thousands! flow!\n\n#### VI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Thou, Indu, with thy streams that drop sweet juices, which were poured for\nhelp,  \nHast settled in the cleansing sieve.  \n2\\. So flow thou onward through the fleece, for Indra flow to be his drink,  \nSeating thee in the shrine of Law!  \n3\\. As giving room and freedom, as most sweet, pour butter forth and milk,  \nO Soma, for the Angirasas!\n\n#### VII Agni\n\n1\\. Thy glories are, like lightnings from the rainy cloud, visible, Agni, like\nthe comings of the Dawns,  \nWhen, loosed to wander over plants and forest trees, thou crammest by thyself\nthy food into thy mouth.  \n2\\. When, sped and urged by wind, thou spreadest thee abroad, soon piercing\nthrough thy food according to thy will,  \nThe hosts, who ne'er decayest, eager to consume, like men on chariots, Agni!\nstrive on every side.  \n3\\. Agni, the Hotar-priest who fills the assembly full, waker of wisdom, chief\ncontroller of the thought-  \nThee, yea, none other than thyself, doth man elect priest of the holy\noffering, great and small, alike.\n\n#### VIII Mitra-Varuna\n\n1\\. Even far and wide, O Varuna and Mitra, doth your help extend:  \nMay I obtain your kind good-will!  \n2\\. True Gods, may we completely gain food and a dwelling place from you:  \nYe Mitras, may we be your own!  \n3\\. Guard us, ye Mitras, with your guards, save us, ye skilled to save: may we  \nSubdue the Dasyus by ourselves!\n\n#### IX Indra\n\nI. Arising in thy might, thy jaws thou shookest Indra, having drunk  \nThe Soma which the press had shed.  \n2\\. Indra, both world gave place to thee as thou wast fighting, when thou wast  \nThe slayer of the Dasyu hosts.  \n3\\. From Indra, have I measured out a song eight-footed with nine parts,  \nDelicate, strengthening the Law.\n\n#### X Indra-Agni\n\n1\\. Indra and Agni, these our songs of praise have sounded forth to you:  \nYe who bring blessings! drink the juice  \n2\\. Come, Indra, Agni, with those teams, desired of many, which ye have,  \nO heroes, for the worshipper  \n3\\. With those to his libation poured, ye heroes, Indra, Agni, come:  \nCome ye to drink the Soma-juice!\n\n#### XI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Soma, flow on exceeding bright with loud roar to the reservoirs,  \nResting in wooden vats thy home!  \n2\\. Let water winning Somas flow to Indra, Vayu, Varuna,  \nTo Vishnu and Marut host!  \n3\\. Soma, bestowing food upon our progeny, from every side  \nPour on us riches thousandfold.\n\n#### XII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Pressed out by pressers Soma goes over the fleecy backs of sheep,  \nGoes even as with a mare in tawny-coloured stream, goes in a sweetly-sounding\nstream.  \n2\\. Down to the water Soma, rich in kine, bath flowed with cows, with cows\nthat have been milked.  \nThey have approached the mixing-vessels as a sea: the cheerer streams for the\ncarouse.\n\n#### XIII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. O Purifying Soma, bring to us the wondrous treasure, meet.  \nFor lauds, that is in earth and heaven!  \n2\\. Cleansing the lives of men, thou, Steer, bellowing on the sacred grass,  \nGold-hued, hast settled in thy home.  \n3\\. For ye twain, Indra, Soma, are Lords of heaven's light, Lords of the kine:  \nProsper, as mighty ones, our prayers\n\n#### XIV Indra\n\n1\\. By men hath Indra been advanced, the Vritra-sIayer, to joy and strength.  \nHim only we invoke for help in battles whether great or small be he our aid in\ndeeds or might!  \n2\\. For, hero, thou art like a host, art giver of abundant spoil.  \nStrengthening e'en the feeble, thou aidest the sacrificer, thou givest great\nwealth to him who pours.  \n3\\. When war and battles are on foot, booty is offered to the bold.  \nYoke thou thy wildly-rushing bays! Whom wilt thou slay, and whom enrich? Do\nthou, O Indra, make us rich!\n\n#### XV Indra\n\nI. The juice of Soma thus diffused, sweet to the taste, the bright cows drink,  \nWho travelling in splendour close to mighty Indra's side rejoice, good in\ntheir own supremacy.  \n2\\. Craving his touch the dappled kine mingle the Soma with their milk.  \nThe milch-kine dear to Indra send forth his death dealing thunder-bolt, good\nin their own supremacy.  \n3\\. With veneration, passing wise, they honour his victorious might.  \nThey follow close his many laws to win them due preeminence, good in their own\nsupremacy.\n\n#### XVI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Strong, mountain-born, the stalk hath been pressed in the streams for\nrapturous joy.  \nHawk-like he settles in his home.  \n2\\. Fair is the juice beloved of Gods, washed in the waters, pressed by men:  \nThe milch kine sweeten it with milk  \n3\\. Then, like a steed, have they adorned the inciter for eternal life,  \nThe meath's juice at the festival.\n\n#### XVII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Make high and splendid glory shine hitherward, Lord of food, God, on the\nfriend of Gods  \nUnclose the cask of middle air  \n2\\.

Breath of the mighty Dames, the Child, speeding the plan of sacrifice,  \nSurpasses all things that are dear, yea, from of old.  \n2\\. The place that is concealed hath gained a share of Trita's pressing-\nstones,  \nBy the seven laws of sacrifice, even that dear place.  \n3\\. He hath sent forth unto the heights the three, in stream, as Trita's\nwealth:  \nHe who is passing wise measures his pathways out.\n\n#### XIX Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Flow to the filter with thy stream, effused, to win us spoil and wealth,  \nSoma exceeding rich in meath for Indra, Vishnu, and the Gods  \n2\\. The hymns that know not guile, caress thee, golden-coloured, in the sieve.  \nAs mothers, Pavamana, lick the new-born calf, as Law commands.  \n3\\. Lord of great sway, thou liftest thee above the heavens, above the earth.  \nThou, of Pavamana, hast assumed thy coat of mail with majesty.\n\n#### XX Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Strong Indu, bathed in milk, flows on for Indra, Soma exciting strength,\nfor his carousal.  \nHe quells malignity and slays the demons, King of the homestead, he who gives\nus comfort.  \n2\\. Then in a stream he flows, milked out with press-stones, mingled with\nsweetness, through the fleecy filter--  \nIndu rejoicing in the love of Indra, the God who gladdens for the God's\nenjoyment.  \n3\\. He flows, as he is cleansed, to sacred duties, a God bedewing Gods with\nhis own juices.  \nIndu hath, clothed in powers that suit the season, on the raised fleece\nengaged the ten swift fingers.\n\n#### XXI Agni\n\n1\\. O Agni, God, we kindle thee, refulgent, wasting not away,  \nThat this more glorious fuel may send forth for thee its shine to heaven.\nBring food to those who sing thy praise!  \n2\\. To thee the splendid, Lord of light! bright! wondrous! prince of men! is\nbrought.  \nOblation with the holy verse, O Agni, bearer of our gifts! Bring food to those\nwho sing thy praise!  \n3\\.

Bring food to\nthose who sing thy praise!\n\n#### XXII Indra\n\n1\\. Sing ye a psalm to Indra; sing a great song to the lofty Sage,  \nTo him who maketh prayer, inspired, who loveth laud.  \n2\\. Thou, Indra, art the conqueror: thou gavest splendour to the Sun.  \nMaker of all things, thou art mighty and All-God.  \n3\\. Radiant with light thou wentest to the sky, the luminous realm of -heaven.  \nThe Gods, O Indra, strove to win thy friendly love.\n\n#### XXIII Indra\n\n1\\. This Soma hath been pressed for thee, O Indra, bold one, mightiest, come!  \nMay Indra vigour fill thee full, as Surya fills mid-air with rays  \n2\\. Slayer of Vritra, mount thy car! The bay steeds have been yoked by prayer.  \nMay, with its voice, the pressing-stone draw thine attention hitherward!  \n3\\. His pair of tawny coursers bring Indra, resistless in his might.  \nHither to Rishis' songs of praise and sacrifice performed by men.\n\n## BOOK IV\n\n### CHAPTER I\n\n#### I Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\.

The Lord of heaven, the vigorous and far-seeing one, flowsshouting to the\nbeaker with his thousand streams.  \nColoured like gold he rests in seats where Mitra dwells, the Steer made\nbeautiful by rivers and by sheep.  \n3\\. As Pavamana thou flowest before the streams: thou goest on, before the\nhymn, before the kine.  \nThou sharest mighty booty in the van of war Soma, well-armed, thou art pressed\nout by men who press.\n\n#### II Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Through our desire of heroes, kine, and horses, vigorous Somadrops,  \nBrilliant and swift, have been effused.  \n2\\. They, beautified by holy men and purified in both the hands,  \nAre flowing through the fleecy cloth.  \n3\\. These Soma juices shall pour forth all treasures for the worshipper,  \nFrom heaven and earth and firmament.\n\n#### III Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\.

As mighty food speed hitherward, Indu, as a most splendid steer:  \nSit in thy place as one with power  \n3\\. The well-loved meath was made to flow, the stream of the creative juice:  \nThe Sage drew waters to himself.  \n4\\. The mighty waters, yea, the floods accompany thee mighty one,  \nWhen thou wilt clothe thee with the milk.  \n5\\. The lake is brightened in the floods. Soma, our friend, heaven's prop and\nstay,  \nFalls on the purifying cloth.  \n6\\. The tawny Bull hath bellowed. fair as mighty Mitra to behold  \nHe gleams and flashes with the Sun.  \n7\\. Songs, Indra, active in their might, are beautified for thee, wherewith  \nThou deckest thee for rapturous joy.  \n8\\.

So may we be acquainted with thine innermost benevolence:  \nNeglect us not; come hitherward!\n\n#### XVI Indra\n\n1\\. As, like the Morning, thou has filled, O Indra, both the earth and heaven,  \nSo as the mighty one, great King of all the mighty race of men, the Goddess\nmother brought thee forth, the blessed mother gave thee life.  \n2\\. Thou bearest in thine hand a lance like a long hook, great counsellor.  \nAs with his foremost foot a goat, draw down the branch O Maghavan. The Goddess\nmother brought thee forth, the blessed mother gave thee life.  \n3\\. Relax that mortal's stubborn strength whose heart is bent on wickedness.  \nTrample him down beneath thy feet who watches for and aims at us. The Goddess\nmother brought thee forth, the blessed mother gave thee life.\n\n#### XVII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Soma, the dweller on the hills, effused, hath flowed into the sieve.  \nAll-bounteous art thou in carouse.  \n2\\.

Effused is he who brings good things, who brings us store of wealth, and\nsweet refreshing food,  \nSoma who brings us quiet homes:  \n2\\. He whom our Indra and the Marut host shall drink, Bhaga shall drink with\nAryaman,  \nBy whom we bring to us Mitra and Varuna, and Indra for our great defence.\n\n#### XIX Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Friends, hymn your Lord who makes him pure for rapturous carouse: let them  \nSweeten him, as a child, with lauds and sacred gifts  \n2\\. Like as a calf with mother cows, so Indu is urged forth and sent,  \nGlorified by our hymns;, the god-delighting juice.  \n3\\. Effectual help to power is he. he is a banquet for the troop,  \nHe who hath been effused, more rich in meath, for Gods.\n\n#### XX Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. For us the Soma juices flow, the drops best furtherers of weal,  \nEffused as friends, without a spot, benevolent, finders of the light.  \n2\\. These Soma juices, skill.ed in song, purified, blent with milk and curd,  \nHastening on and firmly set in oil resemble beauteous suns.  \n3\\. Effused by means of pressing- stones, upon the oxhide visible,  \nThey, treasure-finders, have announced food unto us from every side.\n\n#### XXI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Pour forth this wealth with this purification: flow onward to the yellow\nlake, O Indu!  \nHere, too, the bright one, wind-swift, full of wisdom, shall give a son to him\nwho cometh quickly.  \n2\\. Flow on for us with this purification to the famed ford of thee whose due\nis glory!  \nMay the foe-queller shake us down, for triumph, like a tree's ripe fruit,\nsixty thousand treasures!  \n3\\. Eagerly do we pray for those two exploits, at the blue lake and Prisana,\nwrought in battle.  \nHe sent our enemies to sleep and slew them, and turned away the foolish and\nunfriendly.\n\n#### XXII Agni\n\n1\\. O Agni, be our nearest friend, yea, our protector and our kind deliverer!  \n2\\. As gracious Agni, famed for treasures, come, and, most resplendent, give\nus store of wealth!  \n3\\. To thee then, O most bright, O radiant God, we come with prayer for\nhappiness for our friends.\n\n#### XXIII Indra\n\n1\\. May we, with Indra and the Gods to aid us, bring these existing worlds to\nfull completion!  \n2\\. Our sacrifice, our bodies, and our offspring, let Indra with the Adityas-\nform and finish!  \n3\\. With the Adityas, with the band of Maruts, let Indra send us medicines to\nheal us!\n\n#### XXIV Indra\n\n1\\. Sing to your Indra, mightiest Vritra-slayer, sing to the Sage the song\nthat he accepteth!\n\n### CHAPTER II\n\n#### I Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The God declares the deities' generations, like Usana, proclaiming lofty\nwisdom.  \nWith brilliant kin far-ruling, sanctifying, the wild boar, singing with his\nfoot, advances.  \n2\\. The swans, the Vrishagnas from anear us, restless, have brought their\nclamour to our dwelling--  \nFriends come to Pavamana, meet for praises-and sound in concert their\nresistless music.  \n3\\. He takes the swiftness of the great Far strider: cows low as, 'twere to\nhim who sports at pleasure.  \nHe with the sharpened horns brings forth abundance: the silvery shines by\nnight, by day the golden.  \n4\\. Like cars that thunder on their way, like coursers eager for renown,  \nHave Soma drops flowed forth for wealth.  \n5\\. Forth have they rushed from holding hands, like chariots that are urged to\nspeed,  \nLike joyful songs of singing-men.  \n6\\. The Somas deck themselves with milk as kings are graced with eulogies,  \nAnd, with seven priests, the sacrifice.  \n7\\. Pressed for the gladdening draught the drops flow forth abundantly with\nsong,  \nFlow with the stream of savoury juice.  \n8\\. Winning Vivasvan's glory and speeding the light of Dawn, the suns,  \nPass through the openings of the cloth.  \n9\\. The singing-men of ancient time open the doors of sacred songs--  \nThe men who bring the mighty One.  \n10\\. In close society have come the priests, the sevenfold brotherhood,  \nFilling the station of the One.  \n11\\. He makes us kin with Gods, he joins the Sun, for seeing, with mine eye;  \nI milk the Sage's offspring forth.  \n12\\. The Sun beholdeth with his eye the heaven's dear quarter which the\npriests  \nHave set within the sacred cell.\n\n#### II Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Forth on their way the glorious drops have flowed for maintenance of Law,  \nKnowing what suits this worshipper.  \n2\\. Down in the mighty waters sinks the stream of Meath, most excellent,  \nOblation best of all in worth.  \n3\\. About the holy place the Steer, true, guileless, noblest, hath sent forth,  \nContinuous voices in the wood.  \n4\\. When the Sage, purging manly deeds and lofty wisdom flows, around,  \n5\\. When purified, he sits enthroned as King over the warring clans.  \nWhat time the sages speed him on.  \n6\\. Most dear, gold-coloured, in the fleece he sinks, and settles in the wood:  \nThe singer is besieged with song.  \n7\\. He goes to Indra, Vayu, and the Asvins with the rapturous joy,  \nTo whomsoe'er his power delights.  \n8\\. The waves of pleasant Soma flow to Bhaga, Mitra, Varuna,  \nWell knowing, through his mighty powers.  \n9\\. Gain for us, O ye Heaven and Earth, riches of Meath to win us strength:  \nGain for us treasures and renown.  \n10\\. We choose to-day that chariot-steed of thine, the strong, that brings us\nbliss,  \nThe guardian, the desire of all;  \n11\\.

Agni Vaisvanara, born in course of Order, the messenger of earth, the head\nof heaven,  \nThe Sage, the Sovran, guest of men, our vessel fit for their mouth, the Gods\nhave generated.  \n2\\. To thee, immortal! when to life thou springest all the Gods sing for joy\nas to their infant.  \nThey by thy mental powers were made immortal, Vaisvdnara when thou shonest\nfrom thy parents.  \n3\\. Him have they praised, mid-point of sacrifices, great cistern of\nlibations, seat of riches.  \nVaisvanara, conveyer of oblations, ensign of worship, have the Gods\nengendered.\n\n#### IV Mitra-Varuna\n\n1\\.

Approach, O Indra, basting thee, Lord of bay horses, to our prayers:  \nIn our libation t ake delight!\n\n#### VI Indra-Agni\n\n1\\. Glorify him who compasses all forests with his glowing Dame,  \nAnd leaves them blackened by his tongue.  \n2\\. He who gains Indra's grace by fire enkindled, finds as easy way  \nOver the floods to splendid wealth.  \n3\\. Give us, ye twain, swift steeds to bring Indra and Agni, and bestow  \nAbundant food with wealth on us.\n\n#### VII Soma Pavamana.\n\n1\\. Indu hath started forth for Indra's settled place, and slights not,. as a\nfriend, the promise of his friend.  \nSoma comes onward like a youth with youthful maids, and gains the beaker by a\ncourse of hundred paths.  \n2\\. Your hymns of pleasant sound, praiseworthy, fond of lauds, have come into\nthe hall enclosed for sacrifice.  \nSingers have hymned the golden-coloured as he sports, and milchkine have come\nnear to meet him with their milk,  \n3\\. O Soma, Indu, while they cleanse thee, with thy wave pour orb us plentiful\naccumulated food,  \nWhich, ceaseless, thrice a day shall yield us hero power enriched. with store\nof nourishment, and strength, and meath.\n\n#### VIII Indra.\n\n1\\. No one by deed attains to him who works and strengthensevermore:  \nNo, not by sacrifice, to Indra praised of all, resistless, daring, bold in\nmight;  \n2\\. The powerful conqueror, invincible in war, him at whose birth the mighty\nones,  \nThe kine who spread afar, sent their loud voices out, heavens, earths sent\ntheir loud voices out.\n\n#### IX Soma Vaisvanara\n\n1\\. Sit down, O friends, and sing aloud to him who purifies himself:  \nDeck him for glory, like a child, with holy rites  \n2\\. Loose him who bringeth household wealth, even as a calf with. mother kine,  \nHim who bath double strength, strong, god-delighting juice!  \n3\\. Purify him who gives us power, most blissful one, that he may be  \nA banquet for the troop, Mitra, and Varuna!\n\n#### X Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The Strong hath flowed forth in a thousand streams, flowed through the\nfilter and the sheep's long wool.  \n2\\. With ceaseless genial flow the Strong hath run, purified by the waters,\nblent with milk.  \n3\\. Pressed out with stones, directed by the men, go forth, O Soma, into\nIndra's throat!\n\n#### XI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The Soma juices which have been expressed afar or near at hand,  \nOr there on Saryanavan's bank,  \n2\\. Those pressed among Arjikas, pressed among the active, in, men's homes,  \nOr pressed among the Fivefold Tribes--  \n3\\. May these celestial drops, expressed, pour forth upon us, as they flow,  \nRain from the heavens and hero strength!\n\n#### XII Agni\n\n1\\. May Vatsa draw thy mind away even from thy loftiest dwelling-place!  \nAgni, I yearn for thee with song.  \n2\\. Thou art alike in many a place: through all the regions thou art Lord.  \nIn fray and fight we call on thee.  \n3\\. When we are seeking spoil we call Agni to help us in the strife,  \nGiver of wordrous gifts in war.\n\n#### XIII Indra\n\n1, O Indra, bring great strength to us, bring valour, 5atakratu, thou most\nactive, bring  \nA hero conquering in war!  \n2\\. For, gracious Satakratu, thou hast ever been a mother and a sire to us,  \nSo now for bliss we pray to thee.  \n3\\. To thee, strong! much-invoked! who showest forth thy strength, made very\nmighty! do I speak:  \nSo grant thou us heroic power!\n\n#### XIV Indra\n\n1\\. Stone-Darting Indra, wonderous God, what wealth thou hast not given me\nhere,  \nThat bounty, treasure-finder! bring, filling full both thy hands, to us!  \n2\\. Bring what thou deemest worth the wish, O Indra that which is in heavem!  \nSo may we know thee as thou art a giver boundless in thy gifts!  \n3\\. Thy lofty spirit famed in all the regions as appeasable,--  \nWith this thou rendest even things firm, Stone-darter! so to win thee\nstrength.\n\n## BOOK V\n\n### CHAPTER I\n\n#### I Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The Maruts with their troop adorn and brighten, even at his birth, the\nSage, the lovely infant.  \nBy songs a poet, and a Sage by wisdom, Soma goes singing through the cleansing\nfilter.  \n2\\. Light-winner, Rishi-minded, Rishi-maker, hymned in a thousand hymns,\nleader of sages,  \nEager to gain his third form, mighty, Soma is, like Viraj, resplendent as a\nsinger.  \n3\\. Hawk seated in the press, bird wide-extended, the banner seeking kine and\nwielding weapons,  \nUniting with the sea, the wave of waters, the mighty tells his fourth form and\ndeclares it.\n\n#### II Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Obeying Indra's dear desire these Soma juices have flowed forth  \nIncreasing his heroic might.  \n2\\. Laid in the press and flowing pure to Vayu and the Asvins, may  \nThese give us great heroic strength.  \n3\\. Soma, as thou art purified, incite to bounty Indra's heart,  \nTo seat him in the shrine of Gods!  \n4\\. The ten swift fingers deck thee forth seven ministers impel thee on,  \nThe sages have rejoiced in thee.  \n5\\. When through the filter thou art poured we clothe thee with a robe of\nmilk,  \nTo be a rapturous feast for Gods.  \n6\\. When purified within the jars, Soma bright-red and golden-hued,  \nHath veiled him in a milky dress.  \n7\\. Flow onward to our wealthy lords. Drive all our enemies away:  \nO lndu, pass into thy friend!  \n8\\. May we obtain thee, Indra's drink, who viewest men and findest light,  \nGain thee and progeny and food!  \n9\\. Send down the rain from heaven and make splendour upon the earth! Give us,  \nO Soma, victory in war!\n\n#### III Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Poured through the fleece in thousand streams purified Soma floweth to,  \nIndra's and Vayu's meeting-place.  \n2\\. Sing forth, ye men who long for help, to Pavamana, to the Sage,  \nEffused to entertain the Gods!  \n3\\. The Soma drops with thousand powers are purified to win us strength,  \nHymned to become the feast of Gods.  \n4\\. Yea, as thou flowest bring great store of food that we may win us\nstrength:  \nIndu, bring splendid manly might  \n5\\. Like coursers by their drivers urged, they were poured forth, to win us\nstrength,  \nSwift through the woollen straining-cloth.  \n6\\. May they in flowing give us wealth in thousands, and heroic power,--  \nThese godlike Soma drops effused!  \n7\\. The roaring Soma drops flow on, like milch-kine lowing to, their calves:  \nThey have run forth from both the hands.  \n8\\. Beloved by Indra, bringing joy, roaring as thou art purified,  \nDrive all our enemies away.  \n9\\. As Pavamanas, driving off the godless, looking on the light,  \nSit in the place of sacrifice.\n\n#### IV Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The Soma drops, exceeding rich in sweets, to Indra have been poured,  \nShed with the stream of sacrifice.  \n2\\. Sages have called to Indra, like cows, milch-kine, lowing to their calves,  \nCalled him to drink the Soma juice.  \n3\\. In the stream's wave wise Soma dwells, distilling rapture, in his. seat,  \nResting upon a wild cow's hide.  \n4\\. Far-sighted Soma, Sage and bard, is worshipped in the central point,  \nOf heaven, the straining-cloth of wool.  \n5\\. In close embracement Indu holds Soma when poured within the: jars.  \nAnd on the purifying sieve.  \n6\\. Indu sends forth a voice on high, up in the region of the sea.  \nStirring the cask that drops with meath.  \n7\\. The tree whose praises never fail dwells in the stream of holy milk,  \nUrged onward by its human friend.  \n8\\. O Pavamana bring us wealth bright with a thousand splendours; yea,  \nO Indu, give us ready help!  \n9\\. Sage, poet, poured with all his stream, Soma is driven, far away,  \nTo the dear places of the sky.\n\n#### V Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Loud as a river's roaring wave thy powers have lifted up themselves:  \nUrge on thine arrow's sharpened point!  \n2\\. At thine effusion upward rise three voices fresh and strong, when thou.  \nFlowest upon the fleecy ridge.  \n3\\. On to the fleece they urge with stones the dear, the goldencoloured one,  \nEven Pavamana dropping meath.  \n4\\. Flow with thy current to the sieve, O Sage, best giver of delight,  \nTo seat these in the shrine of song!  \n5\\. Best giver of delight, flow on anointed with the milk for balm,  \nAnd enter into Indra's throat!\n\n#### VI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Flow onward, Indu, with this food for him who in thy wild delights,  \nBattered the nine-and-ninety down.  \n2\\. Smote swiftly forts, and Sambara, then Yadu and that Turvasa,  \nFor pious Divodasa's sake!  \n3\\. Finder of horses, pour on us horses and wealth in kine and gold,  \nAnd Indu, food in boundless store!\n\n#### VII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Chasing our foemen, driving off the godless, Soma floweth on,  \nGoing to Indra's settled place.  \n2\\. O Pavamana, hither bring great riches, and destroy our foes:  \nO Indu, grant heroic fame!  \n3\\. A hundred obstacles have ne'er checked thee when rain to give thy boons,  \nWhen, being cleansed, thou combatest.\n\n#### VIII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Flow onward with that stream wherewith thou gavest splendour to the sun,  \nSpeeding the waters kind to man!  \n2\\. He, Pavamana, high o'er man, yoked the Sun's courser Etasa,  \nTo travel through the realm of air.  \n3\\. Yea, those bay steeds he harnessed to the chariot that the Sun might come:  \nIndu, he said, is Indra's self.\n\n#### IX Agni\n\n1\\. Associate with fires, make your God Agni envoy at sacrifice, best skilled\nin worship,  \nEstablished firm among mankind, the holy flame-crowned and fed with oil, the\npurifier!  \n2\\. Like a steed neighing eager for the pasture, when he hath stepped forth\nfrom the great enclosure:  \nThen the wind following blows upon his splendour, and, straight, the path is\nblack which thou hast travelled.  \n3\\. From thee, a bull but newly born, O Agni, the kindled everlasting flames\nrise upward.  \nAloft to heaven as ruddy smoke thou mountest: Agni, thou speedest to the Gods\nas envoy.\n\n#### X Indra\n\n1\\. We make this Indra very strong to strike the mighty Vritra dead:  \nA vigorous hero shall he be.  \n2\\. This Indra, made for giving gifts, is stablished, mightiest, in strength,  \nBright, meet for Soma, famed in song.  \n3\\. By song, as 'twere' the powerful bolt which none may parry, was prepared:  \nStrong and invincible he grew.\n\n#### XI Soma Pavamana\n\nI. Adhvaryu, to the filter lead the Soma-juice expressed with stones:  \nMake thou it pure for Indra's drink!  \n2\\. These Gods and all the Marut host, Indu! enjoy this juice of thine,  \nThis Pavamana's flowing meath.  \n3\\. Pour out for Indra, Thunder-armed, the milk of heaven, the Soma's juice,  \nMost excellent, most rich in sweets!\n\n#### XII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. On flows the potent juice, sustainer of the heavens, the strength of Gods,\nwhom men must hail with shouts of joy,  \nThou, gold-hued, started like a courser by brave men, art lightly showing\nforth thy splendour in the streams.  \n2\\. He takes his weapons, like a hero, in his hands, fain to win light, car-\nborne, in forays for the kine.  \nIndu, while stimulating Indra's might, is urged forward and balmed by sages\nskilful in their task.  \n3\\. Soma, as thou art purified with flowing wave, exhibiting thy strength\nenter thou Indra's throat.  \nMake both worlds stream for us, as lightning doth the clouds: mete out\nexhaustless powers for us through this our prayer!\n\n#### XIII Indra\n\n1\\. Though, Indra, thou art called by men eastward and westward, north and\nsouth,  \nThou chiefly art with Anava and Turvasa, brave champion! urged by men to come.  \n2\\. Or, Indra, when with Ruma, Rusama, Syavaka, and Kripa thou rejoicest thee,  \nStill do the Kanvas, bringing prayer, with hymns of praise O Indra, draw thee\nhither: come!\n\n#### XIV Indra\n\n1\\. Both boons,-may, Indra, hitherward turned, listen to this prayer of ours.  \nAnd mightiest Maghavan with thought inclined to us come near to drink to Soma\njuice!  \n2\\. For him, strong, independent ruler, Heaven and Earth have fashioned forth\nwith power and might.  \nThou seatest thee as first among thy peers in place, for thy soul longs for\nSoma juice.\n\n#### XV Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. God, working with mankind flow on; to Indra go thy gladdening juice:  \nTo Vayu mount as Law commands!  \n2\\. O Soma Pavamana, thou pourest out wealth that may be famed:  \nO Indu, pass into the lake!  \n3\\. Soma, thou flowest chasing foes, finder of wisdom and delight:  \nDrive thou the godless folk afar!\n\n#### XVI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Stream on us riches that are craved by hundreds, best at winning spoil,  \nRiches, O Indu, thousandfold, most splendid, that surpass the light!  \n2\\. May we, O Vasu, be most near to this thy bounty, food, and wealth!  \nDesired by many men, and in thy favour, O resistless one!  \n3\\. Effused, this Indu hath flowed on, distilling rapture, to the fleece.  \nHe streams erect to sacrifice, as 'twere with splendour, seeking kine.\n\n#### XVII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Flow onward, Soma, as a mighty sea, as Father of the Gods, to every form!  \n2\\. Flow on, O Soma, radiant for the Gods, blissful to heaven and earth and\nliving things!  \n3\\. Thou art, bright juice, sustainer of the sky: flow, mighty, in accordance\nwith true law!\n\n#### XVIII Agni\n\nI. I laud your most beloved guest, like a dear friend,  \nO Agni, him!  \nWho, like a chariot, wins us wealth.  \n2\\. Whom as a Sage who merits praise the Gods have, from the olden time,  \nEstablished among mortal men.  \n3\\. Do thou, most youthful God, protect the men who offer, hear their songs,  \nAnd of thyself preserve their seed!\n\n#### XIX Indra\n\n1\\. Come unto us, O Indra, dear, still conquering, unconcealable  \nWide as a mountain spread on all sides, Lord of heaven.  \n2\\. O truthful Soma-drinker, thou art mightier than both the worlds.  \nThou strengthenest him who pours'libation, Lord of heaven.  \n3\\. For thou art he, O Indra, who upholdeth all our fortresses,  \nThe Dasyu's slayer, man's sustainer, Lord of heaven.\n\n#### XX Indra\n\n1\\. Render of forts, the young, the wise, of strength unmeasured, was he born,  \nSustainer of each sacred rite, Indra, the Thunderer, much extolled,  \n2\\. Thou wielder of the stone, didst burst the cave of Vala rich in kine.  \nThe Gods came pressing to thy side, and free from terror aided thee.  \n3\\. They glorified with hymns of praise Indra who reigneth by his might,  \nWhose bounteous gifts in thousands come, yea, even more abundantly.\n\n### CHAPTER II\n\n#### I Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Guard of all being, generating creatures, loud roared the sea as highest\nlaw commanded.  \nStrong in the filter, on the fleecy summit, pressed from the stone, Soma hath\nwaxen mighty.  \n2\\. Make Vayu glad, for furtherance and bounty: cheer Varuna and Mitra, as\nthey cleanse thee!  \nGladden the Gods, gladden the host of Maruts: make Heaven and Earth rejoice, O\nGod, O Soma!  \n3\\. Soma, the mighty, when, the water's offspring, he chose the Gods,\nperformed that great achievement.  \nHe, Pavamana, granted strength to Indra: he, Indu, generated strength in\nSurya.\n\n#### II Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Here present this immortal God flies, like a bird upon her wings,  \nTo settle in the vats of wood.  \n2\\. Praised by the sacred bards, this God dives into waters, and bestows  \nRich gifts upon the worshipper.  \n3\\. He. like a warrior going forth with heroes, as he flows along.  \nIs fain to win all precious boons.  \n4\\. This God as he is flowirig on speeds like a car and gives his aid:  \nHe lets his voice be heard of all.  \n5\\. This God, while flowing, is adorned, gold-coloured, for the spoil, by men  \nDevout and skilled in holy songs.  \n6\\. This God, made ready with the hymn runs swiftly through the winding ways,  \nInviolable as he flows.  \n7\\. A way he rushes with his stream, across the regions, into heaven,  \nAnd roars as he is flowing on.  \n8\\. While flowing, meet for sacrifice, he hath gone up to heaven, across  \nThe regions, never overthrown.  \n9\\. By generation long ago, this God, engendered for the Gods,  \nFlows tawny to the straining-cloth.  \n10\\. This Lord of many holy laws, even at his birth engendering strength,  \nEffused, flows onward in a stream.\n\n#### III Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Through the fine fingers, with the song, this hero comes with rapid cars,  \nGoing to Indra's settled place.  \n2\\. In holy thought he ponders much for the great service of theGods,  \nWhere the immortals have their seat.  \n3\\. Men beautify him in the vats, him worthy to be beautified,  \nHim who brings forth abundant food.  \n4\\. He is deposited and led along the consecrated path  \nWhen zealous men are urging him,  \n5\\. He moves, a vigorous steed, adorned with beauteous rays of shining gold,  \nHe who is Sovran of the streams.  \n6\\. He brandishes his horns on high, and whets them, bull who leads the herd,  \nDoing with might heroic deeds.  \n7\\. He, over places rough to pass bringing rich treasures, closely pressed.  \nDescends into the reservoirs.  \n8\\. Him, even him the golden-hued, well armed, best giver of delight,  \nTen fingers urge to run his course.\n\n#### IV Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. This Bull, this chariot robes him in the sheep's long wool as heproceeds.  \nTo war that wins a thousand spoils.  \n2\\. The dames of Trita with the stones urge forth this goldencoloured one,  \nIndu to Indra for his drink.  \n3\\. He like a falcon settles down amid the families of men,  \nLike lover speeding to his love.  \n4\\. This young exhilarating juice looks downward from its place in heaven,  \nThis Soma drop that pierced the sieve.  \n5\\. Pressed for the draught, this tawny juice flows forth intelligent, calling\nout,  \nUnto the well-beloved place.  \n6\\. Him, here, the gold-decked skilful ten cleanse carefully, who make him\nbright.  \nAnd beauteous for the gladdening draught.\n\n#### V Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Urged by the men, this vigorous steed, Lord of the mind omniscient,  \nFlies to the long wool of the sheep.  \n2\\. Within the filter hath he flowed, this Soma for the Gods effused.  \nEntering all their essences.  \n3\\. He shines in beauty there, this God, immortal, in his dwellingplace,  \nFoe-slayer, dearest to the Gods.  \n4\\. Directed by the sisters ten, bellowing on his way this Steer  \nRuns onward to the wooden vats.  \n5\\. This Pavamana, gladdening drink within the purifying sieve,  \nGave splendour to the Sun in heaven.  \n6\\. Unconquerable Lord of speech, dwelling beside Viavasvan, he  \nMounts up together with the Sun.\n\n#### VI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. This Sage, exalted by our lands, flows to the purifying sieve,  \nScattering foes as he is cleansed.  \n2\\. Giver of strength, winner of light, for Indra and for Vayu he  \nIs poured upon the filtering-cloth.  \n3\\. The men conduct him, Soma, Steer, omniscient the head of heaven.  \nEffused into the vats of wood.  \n4\\. Longing for kine, longing for gold hath Indu Pavamana roared,  \nStill conqueror, never overcome.  \n5\\. To Indra in the firmament this mighty tawny Steer hath flowed  \nThis Indu, being purified.  \n6\\. This Soma being purified flows mighty and invincible, Slayer of sinners,\ndear to Gods.\n\n#### VII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. This Soma, strong effused for draught, flows to the purifying sieve,  \nSlaying the fiends, loving the Gods.  \n2\\. Far sighted, tawny-coloured, he flows to the sieve intelligent,  \nBellowing to his place of rest.  \n3\\. This vigorous Pavamana runs forth to the luminous realm of heaven,  \nFiend-slayer, through the sheep's long wool.  \n4\\. This Pavamana, up above on Trita's ridge, hath made the Sun,  \nTogether with the Sisters, shine.  \n5\\. Effused, this Soma, Steer, who slays Vritra, room-giver, unbeguiled,  \nHath gone as 'twere to win the spoil.  \n6\\. Urged by the sage upon his way, this God speeds forward to the: vats,  \nIndu to Indra, giving boons.\n\n#### VIII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The man who reads the essence stored by saints, the Pavamana hymns,  \nTastes food completely purified, made sweet by Matarisvan's touch.  \n2\\. Whoever reads the essence stored by saints, the Pavamana hymns,  \nFor him Sarasvat! pours forth water and butter, milk and meath.  \n3\\. Yea, for the Pavamanas flow richly, drop fatness, bring us weal,--  \nAmrit deposited among the Brahmans, essence stored by saints.  \n4\\. So may the Pavamana hymns bestow on us this world and that,  \nAnd gratify our hearts' desires'-the Goddesses combined with Gods!  \n5\\. The purifying flood wherewith Gods ever purify themselves,--  \nWith that, in thousand currents, may the Pavamanas make us clean!  \n6\\. The Pavamana hymns bring weal: by these man goes to Paradise,  \nAnd, eating pure and holy food, attains to immortality.\n\n#### IX Agni\n\n1\\. We with great reverence have approached the Youngest, who hath shone forth\nwell kindled in his dwelling,  \nWondrously bright between wide earth and heaven, well worshipped, looking\nforth in all directions.  \n2\\. Through his great might o'ercoming all misfortunes, praised in the house\nis Agni Jatavedas.  \nMay he preserve us from disgrace and trouble, both us who laud him and our\nwealthy princes!  \n3\\. O Agni, thou art Varuna and Mitra: Vasishthas! with their holy hymns exalt\nthee.  \nWith thee be most abundant gain of treasure!  \nDo ye preserve us evermore with blessing!\n\n#### X Indra\n\n1\\. Indra, great in his power and might, and like Parjanya rich in rain.  \nHath been increased by Vatsa's lauds.  \n2\\. Since Kanvas have with lauds made him completer of the sacrifice,  \nWords are their own appropriate arms.  \n3\\. When priests who magnify the Son of holy law present their gifts,  \nSages with Order's hymn of praise.\n\n#### XI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Of gold-hued Pavamana, great destroyer, radiant streams have flowed,  \nSwift streams of him whose gleams are swift.  \n2\\. Best rider of the chariot, praised with fairest praise 'mid beauteous\nones,  \nGold gleaming with the Marut host,  \n3\\. Penetrate, Pavamana, best at winning booty, with thy rays,  \nGiving the Singer hero strength!\n\n#### XII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Hence sprinkle forth the juice effused, Soma, the best of sacred gifts,  \nWho, friend of man, hath run among the water-streams He hath pressed Soma out\nwith stones.  \n2\\. Now, being purified, flow hither through the fleece, invincible and more\nodorous!  \nWe joy in thee in waters when thou art effused, blending thee still with juice\nand milk.  \n3\\. Pressed out for all to see, delighting Gods, Indu, far-seeing one, is\nmental power.\n\n#### XIII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Even as a King hath Soma, red and tawny Bull, been pressed the wondrous\none hath bellowed to the kine.  \nWhile purified thou passest through the filtering fleece to seat thee hawk-\nlike in the place that drops with oil.  \n2\\. Parjanya is the sire of the leaf-bearing Bull: on mountains, in earth's\ncentre hath he made his home.  \nThe waters have flowed forth, the Sisters, to the kine: he meets the pressing-\nstones at the beloved rite.  \n3\\. To glory goest thou, a Sage with ordering skill, like a groomed steed thou\nrushest forward to the prize.  \nBe gracious to us, Soma, driving off distress! Thou goest, clothed in butter,\nto a robe of state.\n\n#### XIV Indra\n\n1\\. Turning as 'twere to meet the Sun, enjoy from Indra all good things!  \nWhen he who will be born is born with power we look to treasures as our\nheritage.  \n2\\. Praise him who sends us wealth, prompt with his liberal boons Good 4re the\ngifts that Indra gives.  \nHe is not wroth with one who satisfies his wish: he instigates, his mind to\ngive.\n\n#### XV Indra\n\n1\\. Indra, give us security from that whereof we are afraid  \nHelp us, O Maghavan, let thy favour aid us thus drive away foes and enemies!  \n2\\. For thou, O liberal Lord of ample bounty, art the ruler of our house and\nhome.  \nSo, Indra Maghavan, thou lover of the song, we with pressed Soma call on thee.\n\n#### XVI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Thou, Soma, hast a running stream, sweet-toned most strong at sacrifice:  \nFlow bounteously bestowing wealth  \n2\\. Thou most delightful, when effused, running, the best of gladdeners, art  \nIndu, still conquering, ne'er subdued.  \n3\\. Do thou, poured forth by pressing- stones, flow hither uttering a roar,  \nAnd bring us brightly-glorious strength!\n\n#### XVII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. In might, O Indu, with thy streams flow for the banquet of the Gods:  \nRich in meath, Soma, in our beaker take thy seat!  \n2\\. Thy drops that swim in water have exalted Indra to delight  \nThe Gods have drunk thee up for immortality.  \n3\\. Stream opulence to us, ye drops of Soma, pressed and purified  \nPouring down rain from heaven in floods, and finding light!\n\n#### XVIII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Him with the fleece they purify, brown, golden-hued beloved of all,  \nWho with exhilarating juice goes forth to all the deities  \n2\\. Whom, bright with native splendour, crushed between the preesing-stones, a\nfriend.  \nWhom Indra dearly loves, the waves and ten companions dip and bathe  \n3\\. For Vritra-slaying Indra, thou, Soma, art poured that he may drink,  \nAnd for the guerdon-giving man, the hero sitting in his seat.\n\n#### XIX Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Flow onward Soma, flow for mighty strength, as a strong courser, bathed,\nto win the prize.  \n2\\. The pressers clarify this juice of thine, the Soma for delight and lofty\nfame.  \n3\\. They deck the gold-hued infant, newly-born, even Soma, Indu, in the sieve,\nfor Gods.\n\n#### XX Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The Gods have come to Indu well-descended, beautified with milk,  \nThe active crusher of the foe.  \n2\\. Even as mother cows their calf, so let our praise-songs strengthen him,  \nYea, him who winneth Indra's heart!  \n3\\. Soma, pour blessings on our kine, pour forth the food that streams with\nmilk:  \nIncrease the sea, praiseworthy one!\n\n#### XXI Indra\n\n1\\. Hitherward! they who light the flame and straightway trim the sacred\ngrass,  \nWhose friend is Indra ever young.  \n2\\. Large is their fuel, much their laud, wide is their splinter from the\nstake,  \nWhose friend is Indra ever young.  \n3\\. Unquelled in fight the hero leads his army with the warrior chiefs,  \nWhose friend is Indra ever young.\n\n#### XXII Indra\n\n1\\. He who alone bestoweth wealth on mortal man who offereth gifts,  \nIs Indra only, potent Lord whom none resist.  \n2\\. Whoever with the Soma pressed draws thee away from many men,-  \nVerily Indra gains thereby tremendous power.  \n3\\. When willhe trample, like a weed, the man who hath no gift for him?  \nWhen, verily, will Indra hear our songs of praise?\n\n#### XXIII Indra\n\n1\\. The singers hymn thee, they who chant the psalm of praise are lauding\nthee.  \nThe Brahmans have exalted thee, O Satakratu, like a pole.  \n2, When thou wast climbing ridge from ridge, he looked upon the toilsome task:  \nIndra takes notice of that wish, and the Ram hastens with his troop.  \n3\\. Harness thy pair of strong bay steeds, long-maned, whose bodies fill the\ngirths.  \nAnd, Indra, Soma drinker, come to listen to our songs Of praise!\n\n## BOOK VI\n\n### CHAPTER I\n\n#### I Agni\n\n1\\. Agni,well kindled bring the Gods for him who offers holy gifts;  \nAnd worship them, pure Hotar-priest!  \n2\\. O Sage, Tanunapat, present our sacrifice to Gods to-day,  \nSweet to the taste, that they may help!  \n3\\. Dear Narasansa, sweet of tongue, presenter of oblations, I  \nInvoke to this our sacrifice.  \n4\\. Agni, on thy most easy car, entreated, hither bring the Gods!  \nManus-appointed Priest art thou.\n\n#### II Adityas\n\n1\\. So when the Sun hath risen to-day may sinless Mitra, Aryaman, Bhaga, and\nSavitar send us forth!  \n2\\. May this our home be guarded well: forward, ye bounteous, on the way, Who\nbear us safely o'er distress!  \n3\\. Yea, Aditi, and those great Kings whose statute is inviolate, Are sovrans\nof a vast domain.\n\n#### III Indra\n\n1\\. Let Soma juices make thee glad! Display thy bounty, Thunderer:  \nDrive off the enemies of prayer!  \n2\\. Crush with thy foot the niggard churls who bring no gifts! mighty art\nthou:  \nThere is not one to equal thee.  \n3\\. Thou art the Lord of Somas pressed, Somas unpressed are also thine:  \nThou art the Sovran of the folk.\n\n#### IV Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. True object of our hymns, Sage, watchful Soma hath settled in the press as\nthey refine him.  \nHim the Adhvaryus, paired and eager, follow, leaders of sacrifice and skilful-\nhanded.  \n2\\. He, purified and bringing gifts to Surya, hath filled full heaven and\nearth, and hath disclosed them.  \nHe by whose dear help heroes gain their wishes will yield the precious meed as\nto a victor.  \n3\\. He, being cleansed, the strengthener and increaser, bountiful Soma helped\nus his lustre,  \nWherein our sires of old who knew the footsteps found light and sought the\nkine within the mountain.\n\n#### V Indra\n\n1\\. Glorify naught besides, O friends, so shall no sorrow trouble you!  \nPraise only mighty Indra, when the juice is shed, and say your lauds\nrepeatedly!  \n2\\. Even him, the swift one, like a bull who rushes down men's conqueror,\nbounteous like a cow;  \nHim who is cause of both, of enmity and peace, to both sides most munificent.\n\n#### VI Indra\n\n1\\. These songs of our exceeding sweet, these hymns of praise ascend to thee,  \nLike ever-conquering chariots that display their strength, gain wealth and\ngive unfailing help.  \n2\\. The Bhrigus are like suns, like Kanvas, and have gained each thing whereon\ntheir thought was bent.  \nThe living men of Priyamedha's race have sun g exalting Indra with their\nlauds.\n\n#### VII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Run forth to battle conquering the Vritras! thou Speedest to quell the foe\nlike one exacting debts.  \n2\\. Thou Pavamana, didst beget the Sun with might, and rain in the supporting\nsky,  \nHasting to us with plenty vivified with milk.  \n3\\. For, Soma, we rejoice ourselves in thee effused for great supremacy in\nfight;  \nThou, Pavamana, enterest into mighty deeds.\n\n#### VIII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Flow forth, O Soma, flow thou onward, sweet to Indra's,  \nMitra's, Pushan's, Bhaga's taste!  \n2\\. So flow thou on as bright celestial juice, flow to the vast immortal\ndwelling-place!  \n3\\. Let Indra drink, O Soma, of thy juice for wisdom, and all deities for\nstrength!\n\n#### IX Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Even as the beams of Surya, urging men to speed, they issue forth\ntogether, gladdening as they flow,  \nThese swift outpourings in long course of holy rites: no form save only Indra\nshows itself so pure.  \n2\\. The thought is deeply fixed, the savoury juice is shed; the tongue with\njoyous sound is stirring in the mouth:  \nAnd Pavamana, like the shout of those who press, the drop, rich in sweet\njuice, is flowing through the fleece.  \n3\\. The bull is bellowing; the cows are coming nigh: the Goddesses approach\nthe God's own resting-place.  \nOnward hath Soma pressed through the sheep's fair bright fleece, and hath, as\n'twere, endued a garment newly washed.\n\n#### X Agni\n\n1\\. From the two fire-sticks have the men engendered, with thought, urged by\nthe hand, the glorious Agni,  \nFar-seen, with pointed flame, Lord of the Homestead.  \n2\\. The Vasus set that Agni in the dwelling, fair to behold, for help, from\nevery quarter:  \nWho, in the house for ever, must be honoured.  \n3\\. Shine thou before us, Agni, well-enkindled, with flame, most youthful God,\nthat never fadeth!  \nTo thee come goods and treasures all together.\n\n#### XI Surya\n\n1\\. This spotted Bull hath come and sat before the mother in the east,  \nAdvancing to his father heaven.  \n2\\. As expiration from his breath, his radiance penetrates within  \nThe Bull shines out through all the sky.  \n3\\. Song is bestowed upon the Bird: it reigns supreme through thirty realms.  \nThroughout the days at break of morn.\n\n### CHAPTER II\n\n#### I Agni\n\n1\\. Chant we a hymn to Agni while we go to sacrifice, to him  \nWho hears us even from afar!  \n2\\. Who from of old, in carnage, when the folk were gathered, hath preserved.  \nHis household for the worshipper.  \n3\\. May that most blissful Agni guard our wealth and all ourfamily.  \nAnd keep us safe from pain and grief  \n4\\. Yea, let men say, Agni is born, even he who slayeth Vritra, he,  \nWho winneth wealth in every fight!\n\n#### II Agni\n\n1\\. Harness, O Agni, O thou God, thy steeds which are most excellent!  \nThe fleet ones bring the rapidly.  \n2\\. Come hither, bring the Gods to us to taste the sacrificial feast,  \nTo drink the draught of Soma juice!  \n3\\. O Agni of the Bharatas, flame splendid with unfading might  \nShine forth and gleam, eternal one!\n\n#### III Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Let him, as mortal, crave this speech for him who presses of the juice!  \nAs Bhrigu's sons chased Makha, so drive ye the niggard hound away.  \n2\\. The kinsman hath endued his robe even as a son is clasped in arms.  \nHe went, as lover to a dame, to take his station suitor-like.  \n3\\. That hero who produces strength, he who hath propped both worlds apart,  \nGold-hued, hath wrapped him in the sieve to settle, priest-like, in his place.\n\n#### IV Indra\n\n1\\. Still, Indra, from all ancient time rivalless ever and companionless art\nthou:  \nThou seekest friendship but in war.  \n2\\. Thou findest not the wealthy man to be thy friend: those scorn thee who\nare flown with wine.  \nWhat time thou thunderest and gatherest, then thou, even as a father, art\ninvoked.\n\n#### V Indra\n\n1\\. A thousand and a hundred steeds are harnessed to thy golden car:  \nYoked by devotion, Indra, let the long-maned bays bring thee to drink the Soma\njuice!  \n2\\. Yoked to thy chariot wrought of gold, may thy two bays with, peacock\ntails.  \nConvey thee hither, steeds with their white backs, to quaff sweet juice that\nmakes us eloquent!  \n3\\. So drink, thou lover of the song, as the first drinker, of this juice.  \nThis the outpouring of the savoury sap prepared is good and meet to gladden\nthee.\n\n#### VI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Press ye and pour him, like a steed, laud-worthy, speeding through the\nregion and the flood,  \nWho swims in water, dwells in wood  \n2\\. The Steer with thousand streams who poureth out the rain, dear to the race\nof deities;  \nWho, born in Law, hath waxen mighty by the Law, King, God, and lofty\nordinance.\n\n#### VII Agni\n\n1\\. Served with oblation, kindled, bright, through love of song, may Agni,\nbent  \nOn riches, smite the Vritras dead  \n2\\. His father's father, shining in his mother's ever-lasting side,  \nSet on the seat of sacrifice!  \n3\\. O active Jatavedas, bring devotion that wins progeny, Agni, that it may\nshine to heaven!\n\n#### VIII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Made pure by this man's urgent zeal and impulse, the God hath with his\njuice the Gods pervaded.  \nPressed, singing, to the sieve he goes, as passes the Hotar to enclosures\nhoiding cattle.  \n2\\. Robed in fair raiment meet to wear in combat, a mighty Sage pronouncing\ninvocations,  \nRoll onward to the press-boards as they cleanse thee, far-seeing at the feast\nof Gods and watchful!  \n3\\. Dear, he is brightened on the fleecy summit, a prince among us, nobler\nthan the noble.  \nRoar out as thou art purified, run forward! Do ye preserve us evermore with\nblessings!\n\n#### IX Indra\n\n1\\. Come now and let us glorify pure Indra with pure Sama hymn!  \nLet milk-blent juice delight him made stronger with pure, pure songs of\npraise!  \n2\\. O Indra, come thou pure to us, with pure assistance pure thyself!  \nPure, send thou riches down to us, and, meet for Soma! pure, rejoice!  \n3\\. O Indra, pure, vouchsafe us wealth, and, pure enrich the worshipper!  \nPure, thou dost strike the Vritras dead, and strivest pure, to win the spoil.\n\n#### X Agni\n\n1\\. Eager for wealth we meditate Agni's effectual laud to-day,  \nLaud of the God who touches heaven.  \n2\\. May Agni who is Hotar-priest among mankind accept our songs,  \nAnd worship the celestial folk!  \n3\\. Thou, Agni, art spread widely forth, Priest dear and excellent through\nthee  \nMen make the sacrifice complete.\n\n#### XI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. To him, praiseworthy, sacred tones have sounded, Steer of the triple\nheight, the life-bestower.  \nDwelling in wood, like Varuna, a river, lavishing treasure, he distributes\nblessings.  \n2\\. Great conqueror, warrior girt, Lord of all heroes, flow on thy way as he\nwho winneth riches:  \nWith sharpened arms, with swift bow, never vanquished in battle, vanquishing\nin fight the foemen!  \n3\\. Giving security, Lord of wide dominion, send us both heaven and earth with\nall their fulness!  \nStriving to win the Dawns, the light, the waters, and cattle, call to us\nabundant booty!\n\n#### XII Indra\n\n1\\. O Indra, thou art far-renowned, impetuous Lord of power and might.  \nAlone, the never-conquered guardian of mankind, thou smitest down resistless\nfoes.  \n2\\. As such we seek thee now, O Asura, the most wise, craving thy bounty as\nour share  \nThy sheltering defence is like an ample cloak. So may thy favours reach to us.\n\n#### XIII Agni\n\n1\\. Thee have we chosen, skilfullest in sacrifice, immortal, Priest, among the\nGods,  \nBest finisher of this holy rite:  \n2\\. The Waters' Child, the blessed brightly-shining one, Agni whose, light is\nexcellent.  \nMay he by sacrifice win us in heaven the grace of Mitra, Varuna, and the\nFloods!\n\n#### XIV Agni\n\n1\\. Lord of all food is he, the man whom thou protectest in the fight,  \nAgni, and urgest to the fray.  \n2\\. Him, whosoever he may be, no one may vanquish, mighty one!  \nNay, very glorious wealth is his.  \n3\\. May he who dwells with all mankind conquer in fight with steeds of war,  \nWith sages may he win the spoil.\n\n#### XV Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Ten sisters, pouring out the rain together, the sage's quickly  \nmoving thoughts, adorn him.  \nHither hath run the gold-hued Child of Surya, and reached the vat like a fleet\nvigorous courser.  \n2\\. Even as a youngling shouting with his mothers, the bounteous Steer hath\nflowed along with waters.  \nAs youth to damsel, so with milk he hastens on to the settled meeting-place,\nthe beaker.  \n3\\. Yea, swollen is the udder of the milch-cow; thither in streams. comes very\nsapient Indu.  \nThe kine make ready, as with new-washed treasures, the head and chief with\nmilk within the vessels.\n\n#### XVI Indra\n\n1\\. Drink, Indra, of the savoury juice, and cheer thee, with our milky\ndraught!  \nBe, for our weal, our friend and sharer of the feast, and let thy wisdom guard\nus well!  \n2\\. In thy kind grace and favour may we still be strong: cast us not down\nbefore the foe!  \nWith manifold assistance guard and succour us, and stablish us in thy good-\nwill!\n\n#### XVII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The three-times seven milch-kine in the loftiest heaven have for this Soma\npoured the genuine milky draught.  \nFour other beauteous creatures hath he made for his adornment when he waxed in\nstrength through holy rites.  \n2\\. Enjoying lovely Amrit by his wisdom he divided, each apart from other,\nearth and heaven.  \nHe gladly wrapped himself in the most lucid floods, when through their glory\nthey-found the God's resting-place.  \n3\\. May those his brilliant rays be ever free from death, inviolate for both\nclasses of created things--  \nRays wherewith powers of men and Gods are purified! Yea, even for this have\nsages welcomed him as King.\n\n#### XVIII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Lauded with song, to feast him, flow to Vayu, flow purified to Varuna and\nMitra!  \nFlow to the song inspiring car-borne hero, to mighty Indra, him who wields the\nthunder!  \n2\\. Pour on us garments that shall clothe us meetly, send, purified, milch-\nkine, abundant yielders!  \nGod Soma, send us cbariot-drawing horses that they may bring us treasures\nbright and golden!  \n3\\. Send to us in a stream celestial riches, send us when thou art cleansed,\nwhat earth containeth,  \nSo that thereby we may acquire possessions and Rishihood in Jamadagni's\nmanner!\n\n#### XIX Indra\n\n1\\. When thou, unequalled Maghavan, wast born to smite the Vritras dead,  \nThou spreadest out the spacious earth and didst support and prop the heavens.  \n2\\. Then was the sacrifice produced for thee, the laud, and song of joy.  \nIn might thou art above this All, all that now is and yet shall be.  \n3\\. Raw kine thou filledst with ripe milk. Thou madest Surya rise to heaven.  \nHeat him as milk is heated with pure Sdma hymns, great joy to him who loves\nthe song!\n\n#### XX Indra\n\n1\\. Rejoice: thy glory hath been quaffed, Lord of bay steeds! as 'twere the\nbowl's enlivening mead.  \nThine, Steer, is Indu, Steer, the Strong, best winner of a thousand spoils.  \n2\\. Let our strong drink, most excellent, exhilarating, come to thee,  \nVictorious, Indra! bringing gain, immortal conquering in fight!  \n3\\. Thou, hero, winner of the spoil, urgest to speed the car of man.  \nBurn, like a vessel with the flame, the riteless Dasyu, conqueror!\n\n### CHAPTER III\n\n#### I Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Pour down the rain upon us, pour a wave of waters from the sky.  \nAnd plenteous store of wholesome foood!  \n2\\. Flow onward with that stream of thine, whereby the cows have come to us.  \nThe kine of strangers to our home.  \n3\\. Dearest to Gods in sacred rites, pour on us fatness with thy stream,  \nPour down on us a flood of rain!  \n4\\. To give as vigour, with thy stream run through the fleecy straining-cloth!  \nFor verily the Gods will hear.  \n5\\. Onward hath Pavamana flowed and beaten off the Rakshasas.  \nFlashing out splendour as of old.\n\n#### II Indra\n\n1\\. Bring forth oblations to the God who knoweth all, who fain would drink.  \nThe wanderer, lagging not behind the hero, coming nigh with, speed!  \n2\\. With Somas go ye nigh to him chief drinker of the Soma's. juice:  \nWith beakers to the impetuous God, to Indra with the flowing, drops!  \n3\\. What time with Somas, with the drops effused,, ye come beforethe God,  \nFull wise, he knows the hope of each, and, bold one strikes this. foe and\nthat.  \n4\\. To him, Adhvaryu! yea, to him give offerings of the juiceexpressed!  \nWill he not keep us safely from the spiteful curse of each, presumptuous high-\nborn foe?\n\n#### III Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Sing ye a song to Soma brown of hue, of independent might,  \nThe Red, who reaches up to heaven!  \n2\\. Purify Soma when effused with stones which hands move rapidly,  \nAnd pour the sweet milk in the meath.  \n3\\. With humble homage draw ye nigh; blend the libation with the curds:  \nTo Indra offer Indu up  \n4\\. Soma, foe-queller, strong and swift, doing the will of Gods, pour forth,  \nProsperity upon our kine  \n5\\. Heart-knower, Sovran of the heart, thou art effused, O Soma, Tthat,  \nIndra. may drink thee and rejoice.  \n6\\. O Soma Pavamana, give us riches and heroic strength, Indu, with Indra. our\nally!\n\n#### IV Indra\n\nI. Surya, thou mountest up to meet the hero famous for his wealth,  \nWho hurls the bolt and works for men;  \n2\\. Him who with might of both his arms broke nine-and-ninety castles down,  \nSlew Vritra and smote Ahi dead.  \n3\\. This Indra is our gracious friend. He sends, like a full-streaming cow,  \nRiches in horses, kine, and corn.\n\n#### V Surya\n\n1\\. May the bright God drink glorious Soma-mingled meath, giving  \nthe sacrifices lord unbroken life  \nHe who, wind-urged, in person guards our offspring well, nourishes them with\nfood and shines o'er many a land.  \n2\\. Radiant, as high Truth, cherished, best at winning strength, Truth based\nupon the statute that supports the heavens,  \nHe rose, a light that kills Vritras and enemies, best slayer of the Dasyus,\nAsuras, and foes.  \n3\\. This light, the best of lights, supreme, all conquering, winner of riches,\nis exalted with high laud.  \nAll-lighting, radiant, mighty as the Sun to see, he spreadeth wide unshaken\nvictory and strength.\n\n#### VI Indra\n\n1\\. O Indra, give us wisdom as a sire gives wisdom to his sons,  \nGuide us, O much-invoked, in this our way: may we still livc and look upon the\nlight!  \n2\\. Grant that no mighty foes, unknown, malevolent unhallowed, tread us to the\nground!  \nWith thine assistance, hero, may we pass through all the waters that are\nrushing down!\n\n#### VII Indra\n\n1\\. Protect us, Indra, each to-day, each to morrow, and each following day!  \nThrough all the days shalt thou, Lord of the brave, preserve our singers both\nby day and night!  \n2\\. A crushing warrior, passing rich, is Maghavan, endowed with all heroic\nstrength.  \nThine arms, O Satakratu, are exceeding strong, those arms,  \nwhich grasp the thunderbolt.\n\n#### VIII Sarasvan\n\n1\\. We call upon Sarasvan as unmarried men who long for wives,  \nAs bounteous men who yearn for sons.\n\n#### IX Sarasvati\n\n1\\. Yea, she most dear amid dear streams-seven-sistered, loved with foundest\nlove.  \nSarasvati, hath earned our praise.\n\n#### X Svitar. Brahmapaspati. Agni\n\n1\\. May we attain that excellent glory of Savitar the God: So may he stimulate\nour prayers!  \n2\\. O Brahmanaspati, make thou Kakshivan Ausija a loud Chanter of flowing Soma\njuice!  \n3\\. Agni, thou pourest life: send down upon us food and vigorous strength;  \nDrive thou misfortune far away!\n\n#### XI Mitra-Varuva\n\n1\\. So help ye us to riches, great celestial and terrestrial wealth  \nVast is your sway among the Gods!  \n2\\. Carefully tending Law with law they have attained their vigorous might:  \nBoth Gods, devoid of guile, wax strong.  \n3\\. With rainy skies and streaming floods, Lords of the food that falls in\ndew,  \nA lofty seat have they attained.\n\n#### XII Indra\n\nI. They who stand round him as he moves harness the bright, the ruddy steed:  \nThe lights shining in the sky.  \n2\\. On both sides to the car they yoke the two bay coursers dear to him,  \nBrown, bold, who bear the hero on.  \n3\\. Thou, making light where no light was, and form, O men where form was not,  \nWast born together with the Dawns.\n\n#### XIII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. For thee this Soma is effused. O Indra: drink of this j uice; for thee the\nstream is flowing--  \nSoma, which thou thyself hast made and chosen, even Indu for thy special drink\nto cheer thee!  \n2\\. Like a capacious car hath it been harnessed, the mighty, to acquire\nabundant treasures.  \nThen in the sacrifice they shouted lauding all triumphs won by Nahus in the\nbattle.  \n3\\. Flow onward like the potent band of Maruts, like that celestial host which\nnone revileth!  \nQuickly be gracious unto us like waters, like sacrifice victorious, thousand-\nfashioned!\n\n#### XIV Agni\n\n1\\. O Agni, thou hast been ordained Hotar of every sacrifice, By Gods, among\nthe race of men.  \nSo with sweet-sounding tongues for us sacrifice nobly in this rite:  \nBring thou the Gods and worship them  \n3\\. For, as disposer, Agni, God, most wise in sacrifices, thou Knowest\nstraightway the roads and paths.\n\n#### XV Agni\n\n1\\. Immortal, Hotar-priest, and God, with wondrous power heleads the way,  \nUrging the congregations on.  \n2\\. Strong, he is set on deeds of strength. He is led forth in holy rites,  \nSage who completes the sacrifice.  \n3\\. Excellent, he was made by thought. The germ of beings have gained.  \nYea, and the Sire of active power.\n\n#### XVI Agni\n\n1\\. Pour on the juice the heated milk which hasteneth to heaven and. earth;  \nBestow the liquid on the Bull!  \n2\\. These know their own abiding-place: like calves beside themother cows,  \nThey come together with their kin.  \n3\\. Devouring in their greedy jaws, they make sustaining food irb heaven,  \nFor Indra, Agni, homage, light.\n\n#### XVII Indra\n\n1\\. In all the worlds That was the best and highest whence sprang the mighty\none, of splendid valour,  \nAs soon as he is born he smites his foemen, he in whom all  \nwho lend him aid are joyful foe  \n2\\. Grown mighty in his strength, of ample vigour, he as a strikes fear into\nthe Dasa,  \nEager to win the breathing and the breathless. All sang thy praise at banquet\nand oblation.  \n3\\. All concentrate on thee their mental vigour, what time these, once or\ntwice, are thine assistants.  \nBlend what is sweeter than the sweet with sweetness: win quickly with our\nmeath that meath in battle.\n\n#### XVIII Indra\n\n1\\. At the Trikadrukas the great and strong enjoyed the barley-brew. With\nVishnu did he drink the pressed-out Soma juice, even as he would.  \nThat hath so heightened him the great, the wide, to do his mighty work. So may\nthe God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true!  \n2\\. Brought forth together with wisdom and potent strength thou grewest great:\nwith hero deeds subduing the malevolent, most swift in act;  \nGiving prosperity and lovely wealth to him who praiseth thee.  \nSo may the God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true!  \n3\\. So he resplendent in the battle overcame Krivi by might. He with his\nmajesty bath filled the earth and heaven, and waxen strong.  \nOne share of the libation bath he swallowed down: one share he left. Enlighten\nus! So may the God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true!\n\n## BOOK VII\n\n### CHAPTER I\n\n#### I Indra\n\n1\\. Praise, even as he is known, with song Indra the guardian of the kine,  \nThe Son of Truth, Lord of the brave,  \n2\\. Hither have his bay steeds been sent, red steeds are on the sacred grass  \nWhere we in concert sing our songs.  \n3\\. For Indra, thunder-armed, the kine have yielded mingled milk and meath,  \nWhat time he found them in the vault.\n\nII Indra\n\n1\\. Draw near unto our Indra who must be invoked in every fight!  \nCome, thou most mighty Vritra-slayer, meet for praise come to  \nlibations and to hymns.  \n2\\. Thou art the best of all in sending bounteous gyifts, true art thou,,\nlordly in thine act.  \nWe claim alliance with the very glorious one, yea, with the  \nmighty Son of Strength.\n\n#### III Soma Pavamana\n\nI. They have drained forth from out the great depth of the sky the old divine\nprimeval milk that claims the laud:  \nThey lifted up their voice to Indra at his birth.  \n2\\. Then, beautifully radiant, certain heavenly ones proclaimed their kinship\nwith him as they looked thereon:  \nSavitar opens, as it were, the fold of heaven.  \n3\\. And now that thou, O Pavamana, art above this earth and heaven and all\nexistence in thy might,  \nThou shinest like a bull supreme among the herd.\n\n#### IV Agni\n\n1\\. O Agni, graciously announce this our good fortune to the Gods,  \nAnd this our newest hymn of praise!  \n2\\. Thou dealest gifts, resplendent one! nigh, as with wave of Sindhu, thou  \nSwift strearnest to the worshipper.  \n3\\. Give us a share of wealth most high, a share of wealth most near to us,  \nA share of wealth that is between.\n\n#### V Indra\n\n1\\. I from my Father have obtained deep knowledge of eternal Law;  \nI was born like unto the Sun.  \n2\\. After the ancient manner I, like Kanva, beautify my songs,  \nAnd Indra's self gains power thereby.  \n3\\. Whatever gishis have not praised thee, Indra, or have praised thee, wax  \nMighty indeed when praised by me!\n\n#### VI Agni\n\n1\\. Agni, produced by strength, do thou with all thy fires accept our prayer:  \nWith those that are with Gods, with those that are with men exalt our songs!  \n2\\. Forth come to us with all his fires that Agni, whose the mighty are,  \nCome, fully girt about with wealth for us and for our kith and kin!  \n3\\. Do thou, O Agni, with thy fires strengthen our prayer and sacrifices:  \nIncite them to bestow their wealth to aid our service of the Gods!\n\n#### VII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Some, the men of old whose grass was trimmed addressed the hymn to thee\nfor mighty strength and for renown:  \nSo, hero, urge us onward to heroic power'  \n2\\. All round about hast thou with glory pierced for us as 'twere a never-\nfailing well for men to drink,  \nBorne on thy way as 'twere in fragments from both arms.  \n3\\. Thou didst produce him, deathless one! for mortal man, for maintenance of\nLaw and lovely Amrita:  \nThou evermore hast moved making wealth flow to us.\n\n#### VIII Indra\n\n1\\. Pour out the drops f or Indra; let him drink the meath of Soma Juice!  \nHe through his majesty sends forth his bounteous gifts.  \n2\\. I spake to the bay coursers' Lord, to him who grants the boon. of wealth:  \nNow hear the son of Asva as he praises thee?  \n3\\. Never was any hero born before thee mightier than thou:  \nNone certainly like thee in riches and in praise.\n\n#### IX Indra\n\n1\\. Thou wishest for thy kine a bull, lord of thy cows whom none may kill,  \nFor those who long for his approach, for those who turn away from him.\n\n#### X Agni\n\n1\\. The God who giveth wealth accept the full libation poured to him!  \nPour ye it out, then fill the vessel full again, for so the God regardeth you!  \n2\\. The Gods made him the Hotar-priest of sacrifice, oblationbearer, passing\nwise.  \nAgni gives wealth and valour to the worshipper, to man who offers up his\ngifts.\n\n#### XI Agni\n\n1\\. He hath appeared, best prosperer, in whom men lay their holy acts:  \nSo may our songs of praise come nigh to Agni who was born to give the Arya\nstrength.  \n2\\. Him before whom the people shrink when he performs his glorious deeds,  \nHim who wins thousands at the sacrifice, himself, that Agni, reverence with\nsongs!  \n3\\. Agni of Divoddsa, God, comes forth like Indra in his might.  \nRapidly hath he moved along his mother earth; he stands in high heaven's\ndwelling-place.\n\n#### XII Agni\n\n1\\. Agni, thou pourest life: send down upon us food and vigorous strength:  \nDrive thou misfortune far away!  \n2\\. Agni is Pavamana, Sage, Chief Priest of all the fivefold tribes; To him\nwhose wealth is great we pray.  \n3\\. Skilled in thy task, O Agni, pour splendour with hero strength on us,\nGranting me wealth that nourishes!\n\n#### XIII Agni\n\n1\\. O Agni, holy and divine with splendour and thy pleasant tongue. Bring thou\nthe Gods and worship them!  \n2\\. We pray thee bathed in butter, O bright-rayed! who lookest on the sun,\nBring the Gods hither to the feast!  \n3\\. Sage, we have kindled thee, the bright, the feaster on oblation, thee, O\nAgni, great in sacrifice!\n\n#### XIV Agni\n\nI.

Bring to us ever-conquering wealth, wealth, Agni, worthy of our choice,  \nInvincible in all our frays!  \n3\\. Grant us, O Agni, through thy grace wealth to support us evermore,  \nThy favour so that we may live!\n\n#### XV Agni\n\n1\\. Let songs of ours speed Agni forth like a fleet courser in the race,  \nAnd we will win each prize through him  \n2\\. Agni! the host whereby we gain kine for ourselves with help from thee,-  \nThat send us for the gain of wealth!  \n3\\. O Agni, bring us wealth secure, vast wealth in horses and in kine:  \nOil thou the socket, turn the wheel!  \n4\\. O Agni, thou hast made the Sun, the eternal star, to mount the sky,  \nGiving the boon of light to men.  \n5\\. Thou, Agni, art the people's light, best, dearest, seated in thy shrine  \nWatch for the singer, give him life!\n\n#### XVI Agni\n\n1\\. Agni is head and height of heaven, the master of the earth is he:  \nHe quickeneth the waters' seed.  \n2\\. Yea, Agni, thou as Lord of light rulest o'er choicest gifts may I,  \nThy singer, find defence in thee  \n3\\. Upward, O Agni, rise thy flames, pure and resplendent, blazing high,  \nThy lustres, fair effulgences.\n\n### CHAPTER II\n\n#### I Agni\n\n1\\. Who, Agni, is thy kin, of men? who honours thee with sacrifice?  \nOn whom dependent? who art thou?  \n2\\. The kinsman, Agni! of mankind, their well-beiaved friend art thou,  \nA friend whom friends may supplicate.  \n3\\. Bring Mitra, Varukia, bring the Gods hither to. our great sacrifice:  \nBring them, O Agni, to thine home\n\n#### II Agni\n\n1\\. Meet to be worshipped and implored, showing in beauty through the gloom,  \nAgni, the strong, is kindled well.  \n2\\. Strong Agni is enkindled well, even as the horse that brings the Gods:  \nMen with oblations pray to him.  \n3\\. We will enkindle thee, the strong, we, hero! who axe strong ourselves,\n\n#### III Agni\n\n1\\. Thy mighty flames, O Agni, when thou art enkindled, rise on high,  \nThy bright flames, thou refulgent one  \n2\\. Beloved! let my ladies full of sacred oil come nigh to thee.  \nAgni, accept our offerings!  \n3\\. I pray to Agni--may he hear!--the Hotar with sweet tones, the Priest,  \nWondrously splendid, rich in light,\n\n#### V Agni\n\n1\\. O King, the potent and terrific envoy, kindled for strength, is  \nmanifest in beauty.  \nHe shines, observant, with his lofty splendour; chasing black night he comes\nwith white-rayed morning.  \n2\\. Having o'ercome the glimmering Black with beauty, and bringing forth the\nDame, the great Sire's daughter,  \nHolding aloft the radiant lights of Surya, as messenger of heaven he shines\nwith treasures.  \n3\\. Attendant on the blessed Dame the blessed hath come: the lover followeth\nhis sister.  \nAgni, far-spreading with conspicuous lustre, hath covered night with whitely-\nshining garments.\n\n#### VI Agni\n\n1\\. What is the praise wherewith, O God, Angiras, Agni, Son of Strength,  \nWe, after thine own wish and thought,  \n2\\. May serve thee, O thou Child of Power, and with what sacrifice's plan?  \nWhat reverent word shall I speak here?\n\n#### VII Agni\n\n1\\. Agni, come hither with thy fires; we choose thee as our Hotar; let  \nThe proffered ladle filled with offerings balm thee, best of priests, to sit\non sacred grass!  \n2\\. For unto thee, O Angiras, O Son of Strength, move ladles in the sacrifice.  \nWe pray to Agni, Child of Force, whose locks drop oil, foremost in sacrificial\nrites.\n\n#### VIII Agni\n\n1\\. Let our songs come anear to him beauteous and bright with piercing flame,  \nOur sacrifices with our homage unto him much-lauded, very rich, for help:  \n2\\. To Agni Jatavedas, to the Son of Strength, that he may give us precious\ngifts,  \n3\\. Immortal, from of old Priest among mortal men, whose tones are sweetest in\nthe house!\n\n#### X Agni\n\n1\\. Invincible is Agni, he who goes before the tribes of men,  \nA chariot swift and ever new.  \n2\\. By bringing offerings unto him the mortal worshipper obtains  \nA home from him whose light is pure.  \n3\\. Inviolable power of Gods, subduing all his enemies, Agni is mightiest in\nfame.\n\n#### XI Agni\n\n1\\. May Agni, worshipped, bring us bliss: may the gift, blessed one! and\nsacrifice bring bliss,  \nYea, may our eulogies bring bliss  \n2\\. Show forth the mind that brings success in war with fiends, wherewith thou\nconquerest in fight!  \nBring down the many firm hopes of our enemies, and for thy victory let us win!\n\n#### XII Agni\n\n1\\. O Agni thou who art the Lord of wealth in kine, thou Son of Strength,  \nBestow on us, O Jatavedas, high renown  \n2\\. He, Agni, kindled, good and wise, must be entreated with a. song;  \nShine, thou of many forms, shine thou with wealth on us  \n3\\. And, Agni, shining of thyself by night and when the morning breaks,  \nBurn, thou whose teeth are sharp, against the Rakshasas\n\n#### XIII Agni\n\n1\\. Exerting all our strength with thoughts of power we glorify in speech,  \nAgni, your dear familiar friend, the darling guest of every house:  \n2\\. Whom, served with sacrificial oil, like Mitra, men presenting gifts,  \nGlorify with their songs of praise  \n3\\. Much-lauded Jatavedas, him who sends oblations up to heaven,  \nPrepared in service of the Gods.\n\n#### XIV Agni\n\n1\\. Agni, inflamed with fuel, in my song I sing, pure bright, and stedfast set\nin front at sacrifice.  \nWise Jatavedas we implore with prayers for grace, the Sage, the Hotar-priest,\nbounteous, and void of guile.  \n2\\. Men, Agni, in each age, have made thee, deathless one, their envoy,\noffering-bearer, guard adorable.  \nWith reverence Gods and mortals have established thee as everwatchful and\nalmighty household Lord.  \n3\\. Though, Agni ordering the works and ways of both, as envoy of the Gods\ntraversest both the realms.  \nWhen we lay claim to thy regard and gracious care, be thou to us a th rice-\nprotecting friendly guard?\n\n#### XV Agni\n\n1\\. Still turning to their aim in thee the sacrificer's sister hymns  \nHave come to thee before the wind.  \n2\\. Even the waters find their place in him whose three fold sacred grass  \nIs spread unbound, unlimited.  \n3\\. The station of the bounteous God, by his unconquerable aid,  \nHath a fair aspect like the Sun.\n\n### CHAPTER III\n\n#### I Indra\n\n1\\. Men with their lauds are urging thee, Indra, to drink the Soma first.  \nThe Ribhus in accord have lifted up their voice, and Rudras sung thee as the\nfirst.  \n2\\. Indra, at sacrifice, increased his manly strength, in the wild rapture of\nthis juice:  \nAnd living men to-day, even as of old, sing forth their praises to his\nmajesty.\n\n#### II Indra-Agni\n\n1\\. Indra and Agni! singers skilled in melody, with lauds, hymn you:  \nI choose you both to bring me food.  \n2\\. Indra and Agni! ye shook down, together, with one mightyr deed, The ninety\nforts which Dasas held.  \n3\\. To Indra and to Agni prayers go forward from the holy task, Along the path\nof sacred Law.  \n4\\. Indra and Agni, powers are yours, yours are oblations ano abodes: Good is\nyour zealous energy.\n\n#### III Indra\n\n1\\. Indra, with all thy saving helps assist us, Lord of power and might!  \nFor after thee we follow even as glorious bliss, thee, hero, finder-out of\nwealth!  \n2\\. Increaser of our steeds and multiplying kine, a golden well, G God, art\nthou,  \nFor no one may impair the gift laid up in thee. Bring me whatever thing I ask!\n\n#### IV Indra\n\n1\\. For thou--come to the worshipper!--wilt find great wealth to make us rich.  \nFill thyself full, O Maghavan, for gain of kine, full, Indra, forthe gain of\nsteeds!  \n2\\. Thou as thy gift bestowest many hundred herds, yea, many thou-sands dost\nthou give.  \nWith singers' hymns have we brought the fortrender near, singing to Indra for\nhis grace.\n\n#### V Agni\n\n1\\. To him who dealeth out all wealth, the sweet-toned Hotar-priest of men,  \nTo him, like the first vessels filled with savoury juice, to Agni let the\nlauds go forth!  \n2\\. Votaries, bounteous givers, deck him with their songs, even as the steed\nwho draws the car.  \nTo both, strong Lord of men! to kith and kin convey the bounties of our\nwealthy lords!\n\n#### VI Varuna\n\n1\\. Hear this my call, O Varuna, and show thy gracious love today:  \nDesiring help I long for thee!\n\n#### VII Indra\n\n1\\. O Hero, with what aid dost thou delight us, with what succour bring,  \nRiches to those who worship thee?\n\n#### VIII Indra\n\n1\\. Indra, for service of the Gods, Indra while sacrifice proceeds,  \nIndra, as worshippers, in battle-shock we call, Indra that we may win the\nspoil.  \n2\\. With might hath Indra spread out heaven and earth, with power hath indra\nlighten up the Sun. In Indra are all creatures closely held; in him meet the\ndistilling Soma-drops.\n\n#### IX Visvakarman\n\n1\\. Bring, Visvakarman strengthened by oblation, thyself, thy body-'tis thine\nown-for worship  \nLet other men around us live in folly here let us have', a rich and liberal\npatron!\n\n#### X Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. With this his golden splendour purifying him, he with his own allies\nsubdues all enemies. as Sura with his own allies.  \nCleansing himself with stream of juice he shines forth yellow-hued and red,\nwhen with his praisers he encompasses all forms, with praisers having seven\nmouths.  \n2\\. He moves intelligent directed to the east. The every beauteous car rivals\nthe beams of light, the beautiful celestial car.  \nHymns, lauding manly valour, came inciting Indra to success, that ye may be\nunconquered, both thy bolt and thou, both be unconquered in the war.  \n3\\. That treasure of the Panis thou discoveredst. Thou with the Mothers\ndeckest thee in thine abode, with, songs of worship in thine home.  \nAs 'twere from far away is heard the psalm where hymns resound in joy. He,\nwith the triple Dames red-hued, hath won life-power, he, gleaming, hath won\nvital strength.\n\n#### XI Pusan\n\n1\\. Yea, cause our hymn to gain for us cattle and steeds and store of wealth,  \nThat it may help us manfully!\n\n#### XII Maruts\n\n1\\. Heroes of real strength, ye mark either the sweat of him who toils,  \nOr his desire who supplicates.\n\n#### XIII Visvedevas\n\n1\\. The Sons of immortality shall listen to our songs of praise,  \nAnd be exceeding kind to us.\n\n#### XIV Heaven and Earth\n\n1\\. To both of you, O Heaven and Earth, we bring our lofty song of praise,  \nPure pair! to glorify you both.  \n2\\. Ye sanctify each other's form by your own proper strength ye rule:  \nFurther the sacrifice evermore!  \n3\\. Promoting and fulfilling, ye, mighty ones, perfect Mitra's law:  \nYe sit around our sacrifice.\n\n#### XV Indra\n\n1\\. This is thine own. Thou drawest near, as turns a pigeon to his mate:  \nThou carest, too, for this our prayer.  \n2\\. O hero, Lord of bounties, praised in hymns, may glorious fame and might  \nBe his who sings the laud to thee  \n3\\. Lord of a Hundred Powers, rise up to be our succour in this fight:  \nIn other fights let us agree\n\n#### XVI Oblations\n\n1\\. Ye cows, protect the fount: the two mighty ones bless the sacrifice.  \nThe handles twain are wrought of gold.  \n2\\. The pressing-stones are set at work: the meath is poured into the tank  \nAt the out-shedding of the fount.  \n3\\. With reverence they drain the fount that circles with its wheel above.  \nExhaustless, with the mouth below.\n\n#### XVII Indra\n\n1\\. Let us not tire or be afraid with thee, the mighty, for our friend!  \nMay we see Turvasa and Yadu! thy great deed, O hero, must be glorified.  \n2\\. On his left hip the hero hath reclined himself: the proffered feast\noffends him not.  \nThe milk is blended with the honey of the bee: quickly come hither, haste, and\ndrink!\n\n#### XVIII Indra\n\n1\\. May these my songs of praise exalt thee, Lord, who hast abundant wealth!  \nMen skilled in holy hymns, pure, with the hues of fire, have  \nsung them with their lauds to thee.  \n2\\. He, when a thousand Rishis have enhanced his might, hath like an ocean\nspread himself.  \nHis majesty is praised as true at solemn rites, his power where holy singers\nrule.\n\n#### XIX Indra\n\n1\\. Good Lord of wealth is he to whom all Aryas, Dasas here belong.  \nDirectly unto thee, the pious Rusama Paviru, is that wealth brought nigh.  \n2\\. In zealous haste the singers have sung forth a song distilling  \nfatness, rich in sweets.  \nRiches have spread among us and heroic strength, with us are flowing Soma-\ndrops.\n\n#### XX Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Flow to us, Indu, very strong, effused, with wealth of kine and steeds,  \nAnd do thou lay above the milk thy radiant hue  \n2\\. Lord of the tawny, Indu, thou who art the Gods' most special food,  \nAs friend to friend, for splendour be thou good to men!  \n3\\. Drive utterly, far away from us each godless, each voracious; foe;  \nO Indu, overcome and drive the false afar!\n\n#### XXI Soma Pavamana.\n\n1\\. They balm him, balm him over, balm him thoroughly, caress. the mighty\nstrength and balm it with the meath.  \nThey seize the flying Steer at the stream's breathing place cleansing with\ngold they grasp the animal herein.  \n2\\. Sing forth to Pavamana skilled in holy song! the juice is flowing onward\nlike a mighty stream.  \nHe glideth like a serpent from his ancient skin, and like a. playful horse the\ntawny Steer hath run.  \n3\\. Dweller in floods, King, foremost, he displays his might, set among living\nthings as measure of days.  \nDistilling oil he flows, fair, billowy, golden-hued, borne on car of light,\nsharing on home with wealth.\n\n## BOOK VIII\n\n### CHAPTER I\n\n#### I Agni\n\n1\\. With all thy fires, O Agni, find pleasure in this our sacrifice,  \nAnd this our speech, O son of Strength!  \n2\\. Whate'er, in this perpetual course, we sacrifice to God and God,  \nThat gift is offered but in thee.  \n3\\. May he be our beloved King and excellent sweet-toned Hotar may  \nWe with bright fires be dear to him\n\n#### II Indra\n\n1\\. For you from every side we call Indra away from other men  \nOurs, and none others, may he be!  \n2\\. Unclose, our manly hero! thou for ever bounteous, yonder cloud  \nFor us, thou irresistible  \n3\\. As the strong bull leads on the herds, he stirs the people with his might,  \nThe ruler irresistible.\n\n#### III Agni\n\n1\\. Wonderful, with thy saving help, send us thy bounties, gracious Lord!  \nThou art the charioteer, Agni, of earthly wealth: find rest and safety for our\nseed!  \n2\\. Prosper our kith and kin with thy protecting powers inviolate, never\nnegligent!  \nKeep far from us, O Agni, all celestial wrath. and wickedness of godless men!\n\n#### IV Vishnu\n\n1\\. What, Vishnu, is the name that thou proclaimest when thou declaredst, I am\nSipivishta?  \nHide not this form from us, nor keep it secret, since thou didst wear another\nshape in battle.  \n2\\. This offering to-day, O Sipivishta, I, skilled in rules, extol, to thee\nthe noble.  \nYea, I, the poor and weak, praise thee, the mighty, who dwellest in the realm\nbeyond this region.  \n3\\. O Vishnu, unto thee my lips cry Vashat! Let this mine offering,\nSipivishta, please thee!  \nMay these my songs of eulogy exalt thee! Do ye preserve us evermore with\nblessings!\n\n#### V Vayu, Indra and Vayu\n\nI. Vayu, the bright is offered thee, best of the meath, at morning rites.  \nCome thou to drink the Soma juice, God, longed for on thy team-drawn car!  \n2\\. O Vayu, thou and Indra are meet drinkers of these Soma draughts,  \nFor unto you the drops proceed like waters gathering to the vale.  \n3\\. Vayu and Indra, mighty twain, borne on one chariot, Lords of strength,  \nCome to ouf succour with your steeds, that ye may drink the  \nSoma juice!\n\n#### VI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Then thou, made beautiful by night, enterest into mighty deeds,  \nWhen prayers impel the golden-hued to hasten from Vivasvan's place.  \n2\\. We cleanse this gladdening drink of his, the juice which Indra chiefly\ndrinks,  \nThat which kine took into their mouths, oF old, and princes take it now.  \n3\\. Thy with the ancient psalm have sung to him as he is purified,  \nAnd sacred songs which bear the Dames of Gods have supplicated him.\n\n#### VI Agni\n\n1\\. With homage will I reverence thee, Agni, like a long-tailed steed,  \nImperial Lord of holy rites.  \n2\\. May the far-striding Son of Strength, our friend who brings felicity,  \nWho pours his gifts like rain, be ours  \n3\\. From near and far away do thou, the everlasting, evermore  \nProtect us from the sinful man!\n\n#### VIII Indra\n\n1\\. Thou in thy battles, Indra, art subduer of all hostile bands.  \nFather art thou, all-conquering, cancelling the curse, thou victor of the\nvanquisher!  \n2\\. The earth and heaven cling close to thy victorious might, as sire and\nmother to their child.  \nWhen thou attackest Vritra, all the hostile bands shrink and faint, Indra, at\nthy wrath.\n\n#### IX Indra\n\n1\\. The sacrifice made Indra great when he unrolled the earth, and made  \nHimself a diadem in heaven.  \n2\\. In Soma's ecstasy Indra spread the firmament and realms of light,  \nWhen he cleft Vala limb from limb.  \n3\\. Showing the hidden, he drave forth the cows for the Angirasas,  \nAnd Vala he cast headlong down.\n\n#### X Indra\n\n1\\. Thou speedest down to succour us this-ever-conquering God of yours,  \nHim who is drawn to all our songs;  \n2, The warrior whom none may wound, the Soma-drinker ne'er o'erthrown,  \nThe chieftain of resistless might.  \n3\\. O Indra, send us riches, thou omniscient, worthy of our hymns:  \nHelp us in the decisive fray!\n\n#### XI Indra\n\n1\\. That lofty power and might of thine, thy strength and thine intelligence,  \nAnd thy surpassing thunderbolt, the wish makes keen.  \n2\\. O Indra, heaven and earth augment thy manly force and thy renown:  \nThe waters and the mountains stir and urge thee on:  \n3\\. Vishnu in the lofty ruling power, Varuna, Mitra sing thy praise:  \nIn thee the Maruts' company have great delight.\n\n#### XII Agni\n\n1\\. O Agni, God, the people sing reverent praise to thee for strength:  \nWith terrors trouble thou the foe  \n2\\. Wilt thou not, Agni, lend us aid to win the cattle, win the wealth?  \nMaker of room, make room for us  \n3\\. In the great fight cast us not off, Agni, as one who bears a load:  \nSnatch up the wealth and win it all!\n\n#### XIII Indra\n\n1\\. Before his hot displeasure all the peoples, all the men bow down,  \nAs rivers bow them to the sea.  \n2\\. Even fiercely-moving Vritra's head he served with his thunderbolt,  \nHis mighty hundred-knotted bolt.  \n3\\. That might of his shone brightly forth when Indra brought together, like  \nA skin, the worlds of heaven and earth.\n\n#### XIV Indra\n\n1\\. Kind-thoughted is the noble, gladdening, friendly one.  \n2\\. Approach, O beauteous hero, this auspicious pair that draws the car!  \nThese two are coming near to us.  \n3\\. Bend lowly down, as 'twere, your beads: be stands amid the water-flood,  \nPointing with his ten horns the way.\n\n### CHAPTER II\n\n#### I Indra\n\n1\\. Pressers, blend Soma juice for him, each draugbt most excellent, for him  \nThe brave, the: hero, for his joy!  \n2\\. The two stroing bay steeds, voked by prayer, hither shall bring to us our\nfriend,  \nIndra, song-lover, through our songs.  \n3\\. The Vritra-slayer drinks the juice. May he who gives a hundred  \naids  \nApproach, nor stay afar from us!\n\n#### II Indra\n\n1\\. Let the drops pass within thee as the rivers flow into the sea  \nO Indra, naught excelleth thee.  \n2\\. 'Thou' wakeful hero, by thy might hast taken food of Soma juice,  \nWhich, Indra, is within thee now.  \n3\\. O Indra, Vritra-slayer, let Soma be ready for thy maw, The drops be ready\nfor thy forms!\n\n#### III Agni\n\n1\\. Help, thou who knowest lauds, this work, a lovely hymn in Rudra's praise,  \nAdorable in every house  \n2\\. May this our God, great, limitless, smoke-bannered, excellently bright,  \nUrge us to holy thought and wealth  \n3\\. Like soma rich lord of men, may he, Agni, the banner of the Gods,  \nRefulgent, hear us through our lauds!\n\n#### IV Indra\n\n1\\. Sing this, beside the flowing juice, to him, your hero, much invoked,  \nTo please him as a mighty Bull!  \n2\\. He, excellent, withholdeth not his bounteous gift of wealth in kine.  \nWhen lie bath listened to our songs.  \n3\\. May he with might unclose for us the cow's stall, whosesoe'er it be,  \nTo which the Dasyu-slayer goes!\n\n#### V Vishnu\n\n1\\. Through all this world strode Vishnu: thrice his foot he planted, and the\nwhole  \nWas gathered in his footstep's dust.  \n2\\. Vishnu, the guardian, he whom none deceiveth, made three steps,\nthenceforth  \nEstablishing his high decrees.  \n3\\. Look ye on Vishnu's works whereby the friend of Indra, close allied,  \nHath let his holy ways be seen  \n4\\. The princes evermore behold that loftiest place of Vishnu, like  \nAn eye extended through the heavens.  \n5\\. This, Vishou's station most sublime, the sages, ever-vigilant,  \nLovers of holy song, light up.  \n6\\. May the Gods help and favour us out of the place whence Vishnu strode  \nOver the back and ridge of earth.\n\n#### VI Indra\n\n1\\. Let none, no, not thy worshippers, delay thee far away from us!  \nEven from far away come thou unto our feast, or listen it already here!  \n2\\. For here, like rites on honey, those who pray to thee sit by the juice\nthat they have poured.  \nWealth-craving singers have on Indra set their hope, as men set foot upon a\ncar.\n\n#### VII Indra\n\n1\\. Sung is the song of ancient time: to Indra have ye said the prayer.  \nThey have sung many a Brihati of sacrifice, poured forth the worshipper's many\nthoughts.  \n2\\. Indra hath tossed together mighty stores of wealth, and both the worlds,\nyea, and the sun.  \nPure, brightly-shining, mingled with the milk, the draughts of Soma have made\nIndra glad.\n\n#### VIII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. For Vritra-slaying Indra, thou, Soma, art poured that he may drink,  \nAnd for the guerdon-giving man, the hero sitting in his seat.  \n2\\. Friends, may the princes, ye and we, obtain this most resplendent one,  \nGain him who hath the smell of strength, win him whose home is very strength!  \n3\\. Him with the fleece they purify, brown, golden-hued, beloved of all.  \nWho with exhilarating juice flows forth to all the deities.\n\n#### IX Indra\n\n1\\. Indra whose wealth is in thyself, what mortal will attack this man?  \nThe strong will win the spoil on the decisive day through faith in thee, O\nMaghavan!  \n2\\. In battles with the foe urge on our mighty ones who give the treasures\ndear to thee  \nAnd may we with our princes, Lord of tawny steeds! pass through all peril, led\nby thee!\n\n#### X Indra\n\n1\\. Come, priest, and of the savoury juice pour forth a yet more gladdening\ndraught!  \nSo is the hero praised who ever prospers us.  \n3\\. Indra, whom tawny coursers bear, praise such as thine, preeminent,  \nNone by his power or by his goodness hath attained.  \n3\\. We, seeking glory, have invoked this God of yours, the Lord of wealth,  \nWho must be magnified by constant sacrifice.\n\n#### XI Agni\n\n1\\. Sing praise to him, the Lord of light. The Gods have made the God to be\ntheir messenger,  \nTo bear oblation to the Gods.  \n2\\. Agni, the bounteous giver, bright with varied flames, laud thou, O singer\nSobhari,  \nHim who controls this sacred food with Soma blent, who hath first claim to\nsacrifice!\n\n#### XII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Expressed by stones, O Soma, and urged through the long wool of the sheep,  \nThou, entering the press-boards, even as men a fort, goldbued, hast settled in\nthe vats.  \n2\\. He beautifies himself through the sheep's long fine wool, the bounteous,\nlike the racing steed,  \nEven Soma Pavamana who shall be the joy of sages and of holy bards.\n\n#### XIII Indra\n\n1\\. Here, verily, yesterday we let the Thunder-wielder drink his fill.  \nBring him the juice poured forth in sacrifice to-day! Now range you by the\nglorious one!  \n2\\. Even the wolf, the savage beast that rends the sheep, follows the path of\nhis decrees.  \nSo graciously accepting, Indra, this our praise, with wondrous thought come\nforth to us!\n\n#### XIV Indra-Agni\n\n1\\. Indra and Agni, in your deeds of might ye deck heaven's lucid realms:  \nFamed is that hero strength of yours.  \n2\\. To Indra and to Agni prayers go forward from the holy task.  \nAlong the path of sacred Law.  \n3\\. Indra and Agni, powers are yours, yours are oblations and abodes:  \nGood is your zealous energy.\n\n#### XV Indra\n\n1\\. Who knows what vital power he wins, drinking beside the flowing juice?  \nThis is the fair-cheeked God who, joying in the draught, breaks down the\ncastles in his strength.  \n2\\. As a wild elephant rushes on, this way and that way mad with  \nheat,  \nNone may restrain thee, yet come hither to the draught! Thou, movest mighty in\nthy power.  \n3\\. When he, the terrible, ne'er o'erthrown, stedfast, made ready for the\nfight--  \nWhen Indra Maghavan lists to his praiser's call, he will not stand aloof, but\ncome.\n\n#### XVI Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. The Pavamanas have been poured, the brilliant drops of Soma juice,  \nFor holy lore of every kind.  \n2\\. From heaven, from out the firmament hath PavamAna been effused  \nUpon the back and ridge of earth.  \n3\\. The Pavamanas have been shed, the beautified swift Somadrops,  \nDriving all enemies afar.\n\n#### XVII Indra-Agni\n\nI. Indra and Agni I invoke, joint-victors, bounteous, unsubdued,  \nFoe-slayers, best to win the spoil.  \n2\\. Indra and Agni, singers skilled in melody hymn you bringing lauds:  \nI choose you both to bring me food.  \n3\\. Together, with one mighty deed, Indra and Agni, ye shook down.  \nThe ninety forts which Dasas held.\n\n#### XVIII Agni\n\n1\\. O Child of Strength, to thee whose look is lovely, with oblations we,  \nO Agni, have poured forth our songs.  \n2\\. To thee for shelter are we come, as to the shade from fervent heat,  \nAgni, who glitterest like gold  \n3\\. Mighty as one who slays with shafts, or like a bull with sharpened horn,  \nAgni, thou brakest down the forts.\n\n#### XIX Agni\n\n1\\. To give eternal glow, we pray Vaisvanara the holy one, Lord of the light\nof sacrifice.  \n2\\. Who, furthering the light of Law, hath spread himself to meet this work:  \nHe sends the seasons, mighty one.  \n3\\. Love of what is and what shall be, Agni, in his beloved forms,  \nShines forth alone as sovran Lord.\n\n### CHAPTER III\n\n#### I Agni\n\n1.Wise Agni, in the ancient way, making his body beautiful,  \nHath been exalted by the sage.  \n2\\. I invocate the Child of Strength, Agni whose glow is bright and pure,  \nIn this well-ordered sacrifice.  \n3\\. So, Agni, rich in many friends, with fiery splendour seat thyself.  \nWith Gods upon our sacred grass!\n\n#### II Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. O thou with stones for arms, thy powers, rending the fiends, have raised\nthemselves:  \nDrive off the foes who compass us  \n2\\. Hence conquering with might when car meets car, and when the prize is\nstaked,  \nWith fearless heart will I sing praise.  \n3\\. None, evil-minded, may assail this Pavamana's holy laws  \nCrush him who fain would fight with thee!  \n4\\. For Indra to the streams they urge the tawny rapture-dropping steed,  \nIndu, the bringer of delight.\n\n#### III Indra\n\n1\\. Come hither, Indra, with bay steeds, joyous, with tails like peacocks'\nplumes!  \nLet no men check thy course as fowlers stay the bird: pass o'er them as o'er\ndesert lands!  \n2\\. Vritra's devourer, he who burst the cloud, brake forts, and drave the\nfloods,  \nIndra, who mounts his chariot at his bay steeds' cry, shatters e'en things\nthat stand most firm.  \n3\\. Like pools of water deep and full, like kine thou cherishest thy might;  \nLike the milch-cows that go well-guarded to the mead, like water-brooks that\nreach the lake.\n\n#### IV Indra\n\n1\\. Even as the wild bull, when he thirsts, goes to the desert's watery pool,  \nCome hither quickly both at morning and at eve, and with the Kanvas drink thy\nfill!  \n2\\. May the drops gladden thee, Lord Indra, and obtain bounty for him who\npours the juice!  \nSoma, shed in the press, thou stolest and didst drink, and hence hast won\nsurpassing might.\n\n#### V Indra\n\nI. Thou as a God. O mightiest, verily blessest mortal man.  \nO Maghavan, there is no comforter but thou: Indra, I speak my words to thee.  \n2\\. Let not thy bounteous gifts, let not thy saving help all fail us good\nLord, at any time!  \nAnd measure out to us, thou lover of man-kind, all riches hitherward from men\n\n#### VI Dawn\n\nI. This Lady, excellent and kind, after her sister shining forth, Daughter of\nHeaven, hath shown herself.  \n2\\. Red, like a mare, and beautiful, holy, the mother of the kine, The Dawn\nbecame the Asvins' friend.  \n3\\. Yea, and thou art the Asvins', friend the mother of the cows art thou: O\nDawn, thou rules over wealth\n\n#### VII Asvins\n\n1\\. Now Morning with her earliest light shines forth, dear daughter of the\nSky:  \nHigh, Asvins, I extol your praise  \n2\\. Children of Ocean, mighty ones, discoverers of riches, Gods,  \nFinders of treasure through our prayer!  \n3\\. Your lofty coursers hasten over the everlasting realm, whea your car flies\nwith winged steeds.\n\n#### VIII Dawn\n\n1\\. O Dawn who hast a store of wealth, bring unto us that splendid gift  \nWherewith we may support children and children's sons  \n2\\. Thou radiant Lady of sweet strains, with wealth of horses and of kine  \nShine thou on us this day, O Dawn, auspiciously  \n3\\. O Dawn who hast a store of wealth, yoke red steeds to thy car to-day.  \nThen bring us all delight and all felicities\n\n#### IX Asvins\n\n1\\. O Asvins, wonderful in act, do ye unanimous direct  \nYour chariot to our home wealthy in kine and gold!  \n2\\. Hither may they who wake at dawn bring, to drink Soma, both the Gods,  \nHealth-givers, wonder-workers, borne on paths of gold!  \n3\\. Ye who brought down the hymn from heaven, a light that giveth light to\nmen,  \nDo ye, O Asvins, bring strength hither unto us!\n\n#### X Agni\n\n1\\. I think of Agni who is kind, whom, as their home, the milch-kine seek;  \nWhom fleet-foot coursers seek as home, and strong enduring, steeds as home.  \nBring food to those who sing thy praise!  \n2\\. For Agni, God of all mankind, gives the strong courser to theman.  \nAgni gives ready gear for wealth, he gives the best when he ix pleased.  \nBring food to those who sing thy praise!  \n3\\. The Agni who is praised as kind, to whom the milch-kine come. in herds,  \nTo whom the racers, swift of foot, to whom our wellborn princes come. Bring\nfood to those who sing thy praise!\n\nXI Dawn\n\n1\\. O heavenly Dawn, awaken us to ample opulence today,  \nEven as thou didst waken us with Satyasravas, Vayya's, Son, high-born!\ndelightful with thy steeds!  \n2\\. Daughter of heaven, thou dawnedst of Sunitha, Suchadratha's son;  \nSo dawn thou on one mightier still, on Satyasravas, Vayya's son, high-born!\ndelightful with thy steeds!  \n3\\. So bringing treasure, shine to-day on us, thou daughter, of the Sky,  \nAs on one mightier thou hast dawned, on Satyasravas, Vayya's son, high-born!\ndelightful with thy steeds!\n\n#### XII Asvins\n\n1\\. To meet your treasure-bringing car, the car that is most dear to us,  \nAsvins the Rishi is prepared, your worshipper with, songs of praise. Lovers of\nsweetness, hear my call  \n2\\. Pass, Asvins, over all away. May I obtain you for myself,  \nWonderful, with your golden paths, most gracious, bringers of the flood!\nLovers of sweetness, hear my call!  \n3\\. Come to us, O ye Asvins twain, bringing your precious treasures, come  \nYe Rudras, on your paths of gold, rejoicing, with your store of wealth! Lovers\nof sweetness, hear my call!\n\n#### XIII Agni\n\n1\\. Agni is wakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who cometh like a\nmilch-cow.  \nLike young trees shooting up on high their branches, his flames mounting to\nthe vault of heaven.  \n2\\. For the Gods' worship hath the priest been wakened: kind Agni hath arisen\nerect at morning.  \nKindled, his radiant might is made apparent, and the great God hath been set\nfree from darkness.  \n3\\. When he hath roused the line of his attendants, with the bright milk\nbright Agni is anointed.  \nThen is prepared the effectual oblation, which spread in front, with tongues,\nerect, he drinketh,\n\n#### XIV Dawn\n\n1\\. This light is come, amid all lights the fairest: born is the brilliant,\nfar-extending brightness.  \nNight, sent away for Savitar's uprising, hath yielded up a birthplace for the\nmorning.  \n2\\. The fair, the bright is come with her white offspring to her the Dark one\nhath resigned her dwelling.  \nAkin, immortal, following each other, changing their colours both the heavens\nmove onward.  \n3\\. Common, unending is the sisters' pathway: taught by the Gods alternately\nthey travel,  \nFair-formed, of different hues and yet one-minded, Night and Dawn clash not,\nneither do they tarry.\n\n#### XV Asvins\n\n1\\. Agni, the bright face of the Dawns, is shining: the singers' pious voices\nhave ascended.  \nBorne on your chariot, Asvins, turn you hither, and come unto our brimming\nwarm libation!  \n2\\. Most frequent guests, they scorn not what is ready: even now the lauded\nAsvins are beside us.  \nWith promptest aid they come at morn and evening, the worshipper's most\nhealthful guards from trouble.  \n3\\. Yea, come at milking-time, at early morning, at noon of day, and when the\nSun is setting,  \nBy day, at night, with most auspicious favour! Not only now the draught hath\ndrawn the Asvins.\n\n#### XVI Dawn\n\n1\\. These Dawns have raised their banner: in the eastern half of middle air\nthey spread abroad their shining light.  \nLike heroes who prepare their weapons for the fray, the cows are coming on,\nthe mothers, red of hue.  \n2\\. Rapidly have the ruddy beams of light shot up: the red cows have they\nharnessed, easy to be yoked.  \nThe Dawns have made their pathways as in former times: redhued, they have\nattained refulgent brilliancy.  \n3\\. They sing their song like women active in their tasks, along their common\npath hither from far away,  \nBringing refreshment to the liberal devotee, yea, all things to the worshipper\nwho pours the juice.\n\n#### XVII Asvins\n\n1\\. Agni is wakened: Surya riseth from the earth. Bright Dawn hath opened out\nthe mighty twain with light.  \nThe Asvins have equipped their chariot for the course.

When, O ye Asvins, ye equip your mighty car, with fatness and with honey\nbalm, ye twain, our power!  \nTo our devotion give victorious strength in war: may we win riches in the\nheroes' strife for spoil!  \n3\\.

Thy streams that never fail or waste flow forth like showers of rain from\nheaven,  \nTo bring a thousand stores of wealth.  \n2\\. He, flows beholding on his way all well-beloved sacred lore,  \nGreen-tinted, brandishing his arms.  \n3\\. He, when the people deck him like a docile king of elephants,  \nSits as a falcon in the wood.  \n4\\. So bring thou hitherward to us, Indu, while thou art purified.  \nAll treasures both of heaven and earth!\n\n## BOOK IX\n\n### CHAPTER I\n\n#### I Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\. Forward have flowed the streams of power, of this the mighty one effused,  \nOf him who waits upon the Gods.  \n2\\.

These things thou winnest quickly, while men cleanse thee, Soma, nobly\nrich!\n\n#### II Indra\n\n1\\. This Brahman, comer at the due time, named Indra, is renowned and praised.  \n2\\. To thee alone, O Lord of Strength, go, as it were, all songs of praise.  \n3\\. Like streams of water on their way, let bounties, Indra, flow from thee!\n\n#### III Indra\n\n1\\. Even as a car to give us aid, we draw thee nigh to favour us,  \nStrong in thy deeds, quelling attack, Indra, Lord, mightiest! of the brave.  \n2\\.

Thou very mighty one, whose hands by virtue of thy greatness wield  \nThe golden bolt that beaks its way!\n\n#### IV Agni\n\n1\\. He who hath lighted up the joyous castle, wise courser like the steed of\ncloudy heaven,  \nBright like the Sun with hundredfold existence  \n2\\. He, doubly born, hath spread in his effulgence through the three luminous\nrealms, through all the regions,  \nBest sacrificing Priest where waters gather.  \n3\\. Priest doubly born, he through his love of glory hath in his keeping all\nthings worth the choosing.  \nThe man who brings him gifts hath noble offspring.\n\n#### V Agni\n\n1\\. Agni, with hymns may we now accomplish that which thou lovest,  \nStrength, like a horse auspicious, with service!  \n2\\.

The old hath waked the young Moon from his slumber who runs his circling\ncourse with many round him  \nBehold the God's high wisdom in its greatness: he who died yesterday to-day is\nliving.  \n2\\. Strong is the red Bird in his strength, great hero, who from of old bath\nhad no nest to dwell in.  \nThat which he knows is truth and never idle: he wins and gives the wealth\ndesired of many.  \n3\\. Through these Thunderer gained strong manly vigour, through whom he waxed\nin stren gth to slaughter Vritra;  \nThese who through might of actual operation sprang forth as Gods in course of\nLaw and Order.\n\n#### VIII Maruts\n\n1\\. Here is the Soma ready pressed: of this the Maruts, yea, of this  \nSelf-luminous, the Asvins, drink.  \n2\\. Of this, moreover, purified, set in three places, procreant,  \nDrink Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman.  \n3\\. Yea, Indra, like the Hotar-priest, will in the early morning  \ndrink,  \nAt pleasure, of the milky juice:\n\n#### IX Surya\n\n1\\.

For Indra the sublime, the far-pervading, have singers generateo prayer\nand praises;  \nThe sages never violate his statutes.  \n3\\. The choirs have established Indra King for ever for victory him, whose\nanger is resistless:  \nAnd for the bays' Lord strengthened those he loveth.\n\n#### XII Indra\n\n1\\. If I, O Indra, were the lord of riches ample as thine own,  \nI would support the singer, God who scatterest wealth! and, not abandon him to\nwoe.  \n2\\. Each day would I enrich the man who sang my praise, in whatsoever place he\nwere.  \nNo kinship is there better, Maghavan, than thine: a father even, is no more.\n\n#### XIII Indra\n\n1\\. Here thou the call of the juice-drinking press-stone: mark thou the sage's\nhymn who sings and lauds thee!  \nTake to thine inmost self these adorations!  \n2\\.

Rich be the praiser of one rich and liberal, Lord of days! like thee:  \nHigh rank be his who lauds the juice!  \n2\\. His wealth who hath no store of kine hath ne'er found out recited laud,  \nNor song of praises that is sung.  \n3\\. Give us not, Indra, as a prey unto the scornful or the proud:  \nHelp, mighty one, with power and might!\n\n#### XVI Indra\n\n1\\. Come hither, Indra, with thy bays, come thou to Kanva's eulogy!  \nYe by command of yonder Dyaus, God bright by day! have gone to heaven.  \n2\\.

May the stone bring thee as it speaks, the Soma-stone with ringing voice!  \nYe by command of yonder Dyaus, God bright by day! have gone to heaven.\n\n#### XVII Soma Pavamana\n\n1\\.

Agni I deem our Hotar priest, munificent wealth-giver, Son of Strength,\nwho knoweth all that is even as the Sage who knoweth all.  \nLord of fair rites, a God with form erected turning to the Gods, he when the\nflame hath sprung forth from the holy oil, the offered fatness, longs for it\nas it grows bright.  \n2\\. We, sacrificing, call on the best worshipper thee eldest of Angirasas,\nsinger! with hyrnns, thee, brilliant one! with singers' hymn;  \nThee, wandering round, as 'twere the sky, thee who art Hotar-priest of men,\nwhom, Bull with hair of flame, the people must observe, tile people that he\nspeed them on.  \n3\\. He with his blazing Power refulgent far and wide, he verily it iswho\nconquers demon foes, conquers the demons like an axe:  \nAt whose close touch things solid partg and what is stable yields he keeps his\nground and flinches not,like trees.

Agni, spread forth, as ruler, over living things: give wealth, to  \nus, immortal God!  \nThou shinest out from beauty fair to look upon: thou leadest  \nus to beauteous Power.  \n5\\. I laud the Sage, who orders sacrifice, who hath great riches under his\ncontrol.  \nThou givest blest award of good, and plenteous food, thou givest wealth that\nwins success.  \n6\\. The men have set before them, for his favour, Agni, strong, visible to\nall, the holy.  \nThee, Lord divine, with ears to hear, most famous, mens' generations magnify\nwith praise-songs.\n\n#### II Agni\n\n1\\.

Thy spark is black and crackling; kindled in due time, O bounteous, it is\ntaken up.  \nThou art the dear friend of the mighty Mornings: thou shinest in glimmerings\nof the night.\n\n#### III Agni\n\n1\\. Him, duly coming, as their germ have plants received: this Agni have\nmaternal Waters brought to life.  \nSo, in like manner, do the forest trees and plants bear him within them and\nproduce him evermore.\n\n#### IV Agni\n\n1\\. Agni grows bright for Indra: he shines far resplendent in the sky:  \nHe sends forth offspring like a queen.\n\n#### V Agni\n\n1\\. The sacred hymns love him who wakes and watches: to him who watches the\nholy verses.  \nThis Soma saith to him Who wake my dwelling in thy friendship.\n\n#### VI Agni\n\n1\\. Agni is watchful, and the Richas love him: Agni is watchful, Sama hymns\napproach him.  \nAgni is watchful, to him saith this Soma, I rest and have my dwelling in thy\nfriendship.\n\n#### VII Gods\n\n1\\. Praise to the friends who sit in front! to those seated together,praise  \nI use the hundred-footed speech speech.  \n2\\.

O Agni, turn again with wealth sprinkle thou us from everyside.  \nWith thine own all-supporting stream!\n\n#### IX Indra\n\n1\\. If I, O Indra, were like thee, the single ruler over wealth.  \nMy worshipper should be rich in kine.  \n2\\. I should be fain, O Lord of power, to strengthen and enrich thesage,  \nWhere I the ford of herds of kine.  \n3\\. Thy goodness, Indra, is a cow yielding in plenty kine and steeds.  \nTo worshippers who press the juice.\n\n#### X The Waters\n\n1\\.

The store of Amrit that laid away yonder, O Vata, in thine home--  \nGive us strength that we may live!\n\n#### XII Agni\n\n1\\. The fleet steed wearing divers forms, the eagle bearing his golden raiment\nto his birthplace,  \nClothed in due season with the light of Surya, red, hath begot the sacrifice\nin person.  \n2\\. Multiform seed he laid in waters, lustre which gathered on the earth and\nthere developed.  \nIn the mid-air establishing his greatness, he cries aloud, seed of the\nvigorous courser.  \n3\\. He hath, enduing thousand robes that suit him, as sacrifice upheld the\nlight of Surya,  \nGiver of ample gifts in hundreds, thousands, supporter of the heavens, earth's\nLord and ruler.\n\n#### XIII Vena\n\n1\\. They gaze on thee with longing in their spirit, as on a strong-winged bird\nthat mounteth sky-ward;  \nOn thee with wings of gold, Varuna's envoy, the Bird that hasteneth to the\nhome of Yama.  \n2\\. Erect, to heaven hath the Gandharva mounted, pointing at us his many-\ncoloured weapons:  \nClad in sweet raiment beautiful to look on, for he, as light, produceth forms\nthat please us..  \n3\\. When as a spark he cometh ilear the ocean, looking with vulture's eye as\nLaw commandeth,  \nHis lustre, joying in its own bright splendour, maketh dear glories in the\nloftiest region.\n\n### CHAPTER III\n\n#### I Indra\n\n1\\. Swift, rapidly striking, like a bull who sharpens his horns, terrific,\nstirring up the people.  \nWith eyes that close not, bellowing, sole hero, Indra subdued at once a\nhundred armies.  \n2\\. With him loud-roaring, ever watchful victcr, bold, hard to overthrow,\nrouser of battle,  \nIndra. the strong, whose hand bears arrows, conquer, ye heroes, now, now\nvanquish in the combat!  \n3\\. He rules with those who carry shafts and quivers, Indra who with his band\nbrings hosts together,  \nFoe-conquering strong of arm the Soma-drinker, with mighty bow, shooting with\nwell-laid arrows.\n\n#### II Brihaspati. Indra\n\n1\\. Brihaspati, fly with thy chariot hither, slayer of demons, driving off our\nfoemen!  \nBe thou protector of our cars, destroyer, victor in battle, breaker-up of\narmies!  \n2, Conspicuous. by thy strength, firm, foremost fighter, mighty and  \nfierce, victorious, all-subduing,  \nThe Son of Conquest, passing men and heroes, kinewinner, mount thy conquering\ncar, O Indra!  \n3\\. Cleaver of stalls, kine-winner, armed with thunder, who quells an army and\nwith might destroys it--  \nFollow him, brothers! quit yourselves like heroes, and like this Indra show\nyour zeal and courage!\n\n#### III Indra. Brihaspati\n\n1\\. Piercing with conquering strength the cow-stalls, Indra, pitiless hero\nwith unbounded anger,  \nVictor in fight, unshaken and resistless--may he protect our armies in our\nbattles!  \n2\\. Indra guide these! Brihaspati, and Soma, the guerdon and the sacrifice\nprecede them;  \nAnd let the banded Maruts march in forefront of heavenly hosts that conquer\nand demolish!  \n3\\. Ours be the potent host of mighty Indra, King Varuna the Maruts, and\nAdityas!  \nUplifted is the shout of Gods who conquer, hightninded Gods who cause the\nworlds to tremble.\n\n#### IV Indra.Maruts\n\n1\\. Bristle thou up, O Maghavan, our weapons: excite the spirits, of my\nwarring heroes!  \nUrge on the strong steed's might, O Vyitra-slayer, and let the din of\nconquering cars go upward  \n2\\. May Indra aid us when our flags are gathered: victorious be ther arrows of\nour army!  \nMay our brave men of war prevail in battle. Ye Gods, protect us in the shout\nof onset!  \n3\\. That army of the foemen, O ye Maruts, which, striving in its. mighty\nstrength, approaches,  \nHide ye and bury it in pathless darkness that not a man oF them may know the\nother!\n\n#### V Agha\n\n1\\. Bewildering the senses of our foemen, seize thou their bodies, and depart,\nO Agha!  \nAttack them, set their hearts on fare with sorrows; so let our foes abide in\nutter darkness!  \n2\\. Advance, O heroes, win the day, May Indra be your sure defence!  \nMighty and awful be your arms, that none may wound or injure you!  \n3\\. Loosed from the bowstring fly away, thou arrows sharpened by  \nour prayer!  \nGo to the foemen, strike them home, and let not one be left alive!\n\nVI Indra and others\n\n1\\. Let ravens and strong-pinioned birds pursue them: yea, let that army be\nthe food of vultures!  \nIndra, let none escape, no sin-remover: behind them all let following birds be\ngathered!  \n2\\. This host of foemen Maghavan! that cometh on in warlike show--  \nMeet it, O Vritra-slayer, thou, Indra, and Agni, with your flames!  \n3\\. There where the flights of arrows fall like boys whose locks are yet\nunshorn.  \nEven there may Brahmanaspati, may Aditi protect us well, protect us well\nthrough all our days!\n\n#### VII Indra\n\n1\\. Drive Rakshasas and foes away, break thou in pieces Vritra's jaws:  \nO Vritra-slaying Indra, quell the foeman's wrath who threatens us!  \n2\\. O Indra, beat our foes away, humble the men who challenge us:  \nSend down to nether darkness him who seeks to do us injury!  \n3\\. Strong, ever-youthful are the arms of Indra, fair unassailable, never to\nbe vanquished:  \nThese first let him employ when need hath come on us, wherewith the Asuras'\ngreat might was overthrown.\n\n#### VIII Soma, Varuna\n\n1\\. Thy vital parts I cover with thine armour: with immortality King Soma\nclothe thee!  \nVaruna give thee what is more than ample, and in thy victory may Gods be\njoyful!  \n2\\. Blind, O my foemen, shall ye be, even as headless serpents are  \nMay Indra slay each best of you when Agni's flame hath struck you down!  \n3\\. Whoso would kill us, whether he be a stranger foe or one of us,  \nMay all the Gods discomfit him! My nearest, closest mail is prayer, my closest\narmour and defence.\n\n#### IX Indra. All-Gods\n\n1\\. Like a dread wild beast roaming on the mountain thou hast approached us\nfrom the farthest distance.  \nWhetting thy bolt and thy sharp blade, O Indra, crush thou the foe and scatter\nthose who hate us!  \n2\\. Gods, may our ears hear that which is auspicious, may our eyes see that\nwhich is good, ye holy!  \nExtolling you with still strong limbs and bodies, may we attain the age by\nGods appointed!  \n3\\. Illustrious far and wide, may Indra bless us, may Pushan bless us, master\nof all riches!  \nMay Tarkshya with uninjured fellies bless us! Brihaspati bestow on us his\nfavour! Brihaspati bestow on us his favour!\n\n"
