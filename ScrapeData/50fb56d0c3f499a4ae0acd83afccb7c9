Any work, any action, any thought that\nproduces an effect is called a _Karma_. Thus the law of _Karma_ means the law\nof causation, of inevitable cause and sequence. Wheresoever there is a cause,\nthere an effect must be produced; this necessity cannot be resisted, and this\nlaw of _Karma_ , according to our philosophy, is true throughout the whole\nuniverse. Whatever we see, or feel, or do, whatever action there is anywhere\nin the universe, while being the effect of past work on the one hand, becomes,\non the other, a cause in its turn, and produces its own effect. It is\nnecessary, together with this, to consider what is meant by the word \'law.\' By\nlaw is meant the tendency of a series to repeat itself. When we see one event\nfollowed by another, or sometimes happening simultaneously with another, we\nexpect this sequence or co-existence to recur. Our old logicians and\nphilosophers of the _Ny aya_ school call this law by the name of _Vy apti_.\nAccording to them all our ideas of law are due to association. A series of\nphenomena becomes associated with things in our mind in a sort of invariable\norder, so that whatever we perceive at any time is immediately referred to\nother facts in the mind. Any one idea or, according to our psychology, any one\nwave that is produced in the mind-stuff, _chitta_ , must always give rise to\nmany similar waves. This is the psychological idea of association, and\ncausation is only an aspect of this grand pervasive principle of association.\nThis pervasiveness of association is what is, in Sanskrit, called _Vy apti_.\nIn the external world the idea of law is the same as in the internal,--the\nexpectation that a particular\n\np. 93\n\nphenomenon will be followed by another, and that the series will repeat\nitself. Really speaking, therefore, law does not exist in nature. Practically\nit is an error to say that gravitation exists in the earth, or that there is\nany law existing objectively anywhere in nature. Law is the method, the manner\nin which our mind grasps a series of phenomena; it is all in the mind. Certain\nphenomena, happening one after another or together, and followed by the\nconviction of the regularity of their recurrence, thus enabling our minds to\ngrasp the method of the whole series, constitute what we call law.\n\nThe next question for consideration is what we mean by law being universal.\nOur universe is that portion of existence which is characterised by what the\nSanskrit psychologists call _desa-k ala-nimitta_, or what is known to European\npsychology as _space_ , _time_ and _causation_. This universe is only a part\nof infinite existence, thrown into a peculiar mould, composed of space, time\nand causation. It necessarily follows that law is possible only within this\nconditioned universe; beyond it there cannot be any law. When we speak of the\nuniverse we only mean that portion of existence which is limited by our mind;\nthe universe of the senses, which we can see, feel, touch, hear, think of,\nimagine; this alone is under law; but beyond it existence cannot be subject to\nlaw, because causation does not extend beyond the world of our minds. Anything\nbeyond the range of our mind and our senses is not bound by the law of\ncausation, as there is no mental association of things in the region beyond\nthe senses, and no causation without association of ideas. It is only when\n\'being\' or existence gets moulded into name and form that it obeys the law of\ncausation, and is said to be under law; because all law has its essence in\ncausation. Therefore, we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as\nfree will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know,\nand everything that we know is\n\np. 94\n\nwithin our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by the\nconditions of space, time and causation. Everything that we know, or can\npossibly know, must be subject to causation, and that which obeys the law of\ncausation cannot be free. It is acted upon by other agents, and becomes a\ncause in its turn. But that which has become converted into the will, which\nwas not the will before, but which, when it fell into this mould of space,\ntime and causation, became converted into the human will, is free; and when\nthis will gets out of this mould of space, time and causation, it will be free\nagain. From freedom it comes, and becomes moulded into this bondage, and it\ngets out and goes back to freedom again.\n\nThe question has been raised as to from whom this universe comes, in whom it\nrests, and to whom it goes; and the answer has been given that from freedom it\ncomes, in bondage it rests, and goes back into that freedom again. So, when we\nspeak of man as no other than that infinite being which is manifesting itself,\nwe mean that only one very small part thereof is man; this body and this mind\nwhich we see are only one part of the whole, only one spot of the infinite\nbeing. This whole universe is only one speck of the infinite being; and all\nour laws, our bondages, our joys and our sorrows, our happinesses and our\nexpectations, are only within this small universe; all our progression and\ndigression are within its small compass. So you see how childish it is to\nexpect a continuation of this universe--the creation of our minds--and to\nexpect to go to heaven, which after all must mean only a repetition of this\nworld that we know. You see at once that it is an impossible and childish\ndesire to make the whole of infinite existence conform to the limited and\nconditioned existence which we know. When a man says that he will have again\nand again this same thing which he is having now, or, as I sometimes put it,\nwhen he asks for a _comfortable_ religion, you may know\n\np. 95\n\nthat he has become so degenerate that he cannot think of anything higher than\nwhat he is now; he is just his little present surroundings and nothing more.\nHe has forgotten his infinite nature, and his whole idea is confined to these\nlittle joys, and sorrows, and heart-jealousies of the moment. He thinks that\nthis finite thing is the infinite; and not only so, he will not let this\nfoolishness go. He clings on desperately unto _Trishn a_, the thirst after\nlife, what the Buddhists call _Tanha_ and _Triss a_. There may be millions of\nkinds of happiness, and beings, and laws, and progress, and causation, all\nacting outside the little universe that we know, and after all the whole of\nthis comprises but one section of our infinite nature.\n\nTo acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it\ncannot be found here. Perfect equilibrium, or what the Christians call the\npeace that passeth all understanding, cannot be had in this universe, nor in\nheaven, nor in any place where our mind and thoughts can go, where the senses\ncan feel, or which the imagination can conceive. No such place can give us\nthat freedom, because all such places would be within our universe, and it is\nlimited by space, time and causation. There may be places that are more\netherial than this earth of ours, where enjoyments may be keener, but even\nthose places must be in the universe, and therefore in bondage to law; so we\nhave to go beyond, and real religion begins where this little universe ends.\nThese little joys, and sorrows, and knowledge of things end there, and the\nreality begins. Until we give up the thirst after life, the strong attachment\nto this our transient conditioned existence, we have no hope of catching even\na glimpse of that infinite freedom beyond. It stands to reason then that there\nis only one way to attain to that freedom which is the goal of all the noblest\naspirations of mankind, and that is by giving up this little life, giving up\nthis little universe, giving up this earth, giving up heaven, giving up\n\np. 96\n\nthe body, giving up the mind, giving up everything that is limited and\nconditioned. If we give up our attachment to this little universe of the\nsenses, or of the mind, we shall be free immediately. The only way to come out\nof bondage is to go beyond the limitations of law, to go beyond causation.\n\nBut it is a most difficult thing to give up the clinging to this universe; few\never attain to that. There are two ways to do that, mentioned in our books.\nOne is called the \' _neti_ , _neti_ \' (not this, not this), the other is\ncalled the \' _iti_ \' (this); the former is the negative, and the latter is the\npositive way. The negative way is the most difficult. It is only possible to\nthe men of the very highest, exceptional minds and gigantic wills who simply\nstand up and say, "No, I will not have this," and the mind and body obey their\nwill, and they come out successful. But such people are very rare. The vast\nmajority of mankind choose the positive way, the way through the world, making\nuse of all the bondages themselves to break those very bondages. This is also\na kind of giving up; only it is done slowly and gradually, by knowing things,\nenjoying things and thus obtaining experience, and knowing the nature of\nthings until the mind lets them all go at last and becomes unattached. The\nformer way of obtaining non-attachment is by reasoning, and the latter way is\nthrough work and experience. The first is the path of _Jnana-Yoga_ , and is\ncharacterised by the refusal to do any work; the second is that of _Karma-\nYoga_ , in which there is no cessation from work. Every one must work in the\nuniverse. Only those who are perfectly satisfied with the Self, whose desires\ndo not go beyond the Self, whose mind never strays out of the Self, to whom\nthe Self is all in all, only those do not work. The rest must work. A current\nrushing down of its own nature falls into a hollow and makes a whirlpool, and,\nafter running a little in that whirlpool, it emerges again in the form of the\nfree current to go on unchecked. Each human\n\np. 97\n\nlife is like that current. It gets into the whirl, gets involved in this world\nof space, time and causation, whirls round a little, crying out \'my father, my\nbrother, my name, my fame,\' and so on, and at last emerges out of it and\nregains its original freedom. The whole universe is doing that. Whether we\nknow it or not, whether we are conscious or unconscious of it, we are all\nworking to get out of the dream of the world. Man\'s experience in the world is\nto enable him to get out of its whirlpool.\n\nWhat is _Karma-Yoga_? The knowledge of the secret of work. We see that the\nwhole universe is working. For what? For salvation, for liberty; from the atom\nto the highest being working for the one end, liberty for the mind, for the\nbody, for the spirit. All things are always trying to get freedom, flying away\nfrom bondage. The sun, the moon, the earth, the planets, all are trying to fly\naway from bondage. The centrifugal and the centripetal forces of nature are\nindeed typical of our universe. Instead of being knocked about in this\nuniverse, and after long delay and thrashing, getting to know things as they\nare, we learn from _Karma-Yoga_ the secret of work, the method of work, the\norganising power of work. A vast mass of energy may be spent in vain, if we do\nnot know how to utilise it. _Karma-Yoga_ makes a science of work, you learn by\nit how best to utilise all the working of this world. Work is inevitable, it\nmust be so; but we should work to the highest purpose. _Karma-Yoga_ makes us\nadmit that this world is a world of five minutes; that it is a something we\nhave to pass through; and that freedom is not here, but is only to be found\nbeyond. To find the way out of the bondages of the world we have to go through\nit slowly and surely. There may be those exceptional persons about whom I just\nspoke, those who can stand aside and give up the world, as a snake casts off\nits skin and stands aside and looks at it. There are no doubt these\nexceptional beings; but the rest of mankind\n\np. 98\n\nhave to go slowly through the world of work; _Karma-Yoga_ shows the process,\nthe secret and the method of doing it to the best advantage.\n\nWhat does it say? "Work incessantly, but give up all attachment to work." Do\nnot identify yourself with anything. Hold your mind free. All this that you\nsee, the pains and the miseries are but the necessary conditions of this\nworld; poverty and wealth and happiness are but momentary; they do not belong\nto our real nature at all. Our nature is far beyond misery and happiness,\nbeyond every object of the senses, beyond the imagination; and yet we must go\non working all the time. "Misery comes through attachment, not through work."\nAs soon as we identify ourselves with the work we do, we feel miserable; but\nif we do not identify ourselves with it we do not feel that misery. If a\nbeautiful picture belonging to another is burnt, a man does not generally\nbecome miserable; but when his own picture is burnt how miserable he feels\nWhy? Both were beautiful pictures, perhaps copies of the same original; but in\none case very much more misery is felt than in the other. It is because in one\ncase he identifies himself with the picture, and not in the other. This \'I and\nmine\' causes the whole misery. With the sense of possession comes selfishness,\nand selfishness brings on misery. Every act of selfishness or thought of\nselfishness makes us attached to something, and immediately we are made\nslaves. Each wave in the _chitta_ that says \'I and mine,\' immediately puts a\nchain round us and makes us slaves; and the more we say \'I and mine\' the more\nslavery grows, the more misery increases. Therefore, _Karma-Yoga_ tells us to\nenjoy the beauty of all the pictures in the world, but not to identify\nourselves with any of them. Never say \'mine.\' Whenever we say a thing is mine,\nmisery will immediately come. Do not even say \'my child\' in your mind. Possess\nthe child, but do not say \'mine.\' If you do, then will come the misery. Do not\nsay \'my house,\' do\n\np. 99\n\nnot say \'my body.\' The whole difficulty is there. The body is neither yours,\nnor mine, nor anybody\'s. These bodies are coming and going by the laws of\nnature but we are free, standing as witness. This body is no more free than a\npicture, or a wall. Why should we be attached so much to a body? If somebody\npaints a picture, he does it and passes on. Do not project that tentacle of\nselfishness, "I must possess it." As soon as that is projected, misery will\nbegin.\n\nSo _Karma-Yoga_ says, first destroy the tendency to project this tentacle of\nselfishness, and when you have the power of checking it, hold it in and do not\nallow the mind to get into the wave of selfishness. Then you may go out into\nthe world and work as much as you can. Mix everywhere; go where you please;\nyou will never be contaminated with evil. There is the lotus leaf in the\nwater; the water cannot touch and adhere to it; so will you be in the world.\nThis is called \' _Vair agya_,\' dispassion or non-attachment. I believe I have\ntold you that without non-attachment there cannot be any kind of _Yoga_. Non-\nattachment is the basis of all the _Yogas_. The man who gives up living in\nhouses, wearing fine clothes, and eating good food, and goes into the desert,\nmay be a most attached person. His only possession, his own body, may become\neverything to him; and as he lives he will be simply struggling for the sake\nof his body. Non-attachment does not mean anything that we may do in relation\nto our external body, it is all in the mind. The binding link of \'I and mine\'\nis in the mind. If we have not this link with the body and with the things of\nthe senses, we are nonattached, wherever and whatever we may be. A man may be\non a throne and perfectly non-attached; another man may be in rags and still\nvery much attached. First, we have to attain this state of non-attachment, and\nthen to work incessantly. _Karma-Yoga_ gives us the method that\n\np. 100\n\nwill help us in giving up all attachment, though it is indeed very hard.\n\nHere are the two ways of giving up all attachment. The one is for those who do\nnot believe in God, or in any outside help. They are left to their own\ndevices; they have simply to work with their own will, with the powers of\ntheir mind and discrimination, saying, "I must be nonattached." For those who\nbelieve in God there is another way, which is much less difficult. They give\nup the fruits of work unto the Lord, they work and are never attached to the\nresults. Whatever they see, feel, hear, or do, is for Him. For whatever good\nwork we may do, let us not claim any praise or benefit. It is the Lord\'s; give\nup the fruits unto Him. Let us stand aside and think that we are only servants\nobeying the Lord, our Master, and that every impulse for action comes from Him\nevery moment. Whatever thou worshippest, whatever thou perceivest, whatever\nthou doest, give up all unto Him and be at rest. Let us be at peace, perfect\npeace, with ourselves, and give up our whole body and mind and everything as\nan eternal sacrifice unto the Lord. Instead of the sacrifice of pouring\noblations into the fire, perform this one great sacrifice day and night--the\nsacrifice of your little self. "In search of wealth in this world, Thou art\nthe only wealth I have found; I sacrifice myself unto Thee. In search of some\none to be loved, Thou art the only one beloved I have found; I sacrifice\nmyself unto Thee." Let us repeat this day and night, and say, "Nothing for me;\nno matter whether the thing is good, bad, or indifferent; I do not care for\nit; I sacrifice all unto Thee." Day and night let us renounce our seeming self\nuntil it becomes a habit with us to do so, until it gets into the blood, the\nnerves and the brain, and the whole body is every moment obedient to this idea\nof self-renunciation. Go then into the midst of the battlefield, with the\nroaring cannon and the din of war, and you will find yourself to be free and\nat peace.\n\np. 101\n\n_Karma-Yoga_ teaches us that the ordinary idea of duty is on the lower plane;\nnevertheless, all of us have to do our duty. Yet we may see that this peculiar\nsense of duty is very often a great cause of misery. Duty becomes a disease\nwith us; it drags us ever forward. It catches hold of us and makes our whole\nlife miserable. It is the bane of human life. This duty, this idea of duty is\nthe midday summer sun which scorches the innermost soul of mankind. Look at\nthose poor slaves to duty! Duty leaves them no time to say prayers, no time to\nbathe. Duty is ever on them. They go out and work. Duty is on them! They come\nhome and think of the work for the next day. Duty is on them! It is living a\nslave\'s life, at last dropping down in the street and dying in harness, like a\nhorse. This is duty as it is understood. The only true duty is to be\nunattached and to work as free beings, to give up all work unto God. All our\nduties are His. Blessed are we that we are ordered out here. We serve our\ntime; whether we do it ill or well, who knows? If we do it well, we do not get\nthe fruits. If we do it ill, neither do we get the care. Be at rest, be free,\nand work. This kind of freedom is a very hard thing to attain. How easy it is\nto interpret slavery as duty--the morbid attachment of flesh for flesh as\nduty! Men go out into the world and struggle and fight for money or for any\nother thing to which they get attached. Ask them why they do it. They say, "It\nis a duty." It is the absurd greed for gold and gain, and they try to cover it\nwith a few flowers.\n\nWhat is duty after all? It is really the impulsion of the flesh, of our\nattachment; and when an attachment has become established, we call it duty.\nFor instance, in countries where there is no marriage, there is no duty\nbetween husband and wife; when marriage comes, husband and wife live together\non account of attachment; and that kind of living together becomes settled\nafter\n\np. 102\n\ngenerations; and when it becomes so settled, it becomes a duty. It is, so to\nsay, a sort of chronic disease. \'When it is acute we call it disease, when it\nis chronic we call it nature. It is a disease. So when attachment becomes\nchronic, we baptise it with the high-sounding name of duty. We strew flowers\nupon it, trumpets sound for it, sacred texts are said over it, and then the\nwhole world fights, and men earnestly rob each other for this duty\'s sake.\nDuty is good to the extent that it checks brutality. To the lowest kinds of\nmen, who cannot have any other ideal, it is of some good; but those who want\nto be Karma-Yogis must throw this idea of duty overboard. There is no duty for\nyou and me. Whatever you have to give to the world, do give by all means, but\nnot as a duty. Do not take any thought of that. Be not compelled. Why should\nyou be compelled? _Everything that you do under compulsion goes to build up\nattachment_. Why should you have any duty? Resign everything unto God. In this\ntremendous fiery furnace where the fire of duty scorches everybody, drink this\ncup of nectar and be happy. We are all simply working out His will, and have\nnothing to do with rewards and punishments. If you want the reward you must\nalso have the punishment; the only way to get out of the punishment is to give\nup the reward. The only way of getting out of misery is by giving up the idea\nof happiness, because these two are linked to each other. On one side there is\nhappiness, on the other there is misery. On one side there is life, on the\nother there is death. The only way to get beyond death is to give up the love\nof life. Life and death are the same thing, looked at from different points.\nSo the idea of happiness without misery, or of life without death, is very\ngood for school-boys and children; but the thinker sees that it is all a\ncontradiction in terms and gives up both. Seek no praise, no reward, for\nanything you do. No sooner do we perform a good action than we begin\n\np. 103\n\nto desire credit for it. No sooner do we give money to some charity than we\nwant to see our names blazoned in the papers. Misery must come as the result\nof such desires. The greatest men in the world have passed away unknown. The\nBuddhas and the Christs that we know are but second rate heroes in comparison\nwith the greatest men of whom the world knows nothing. Hundreds of these\nunknown heroes have lived in every country working silently. Silently they\nlive and silently they pass away; and in time their thoughts find expression\nin Buddhas or Christs, and it is these latter that become known to us. The\nhighest men do not seek to get any name or fame from their knowledge. They\nleave their ideas to the world; they put forth no claims for themselves and\nestablish no schools or systems in their name. Their whole nature shrinks from\nsuch a thing. They are the pure _S attvikas_, who can never make any stir, but\nonly melt down in love. I have seen one such _Yogi_ who lives in a cave in\nIndia. He is one of the most wonderful men I have ever seen. He has so\ncompletely lost the sense of his own individuality that we may say that the\nman in him is completely gone, leaving behind only the all-comprehending sense\nof the divine. If an animal bites one of his arms, he is ready to give it his\nother arm also, and say that it is the Lord\'s will. Everything that comes to\nhim is from the Lord. He does not show himself to men, and yet he is a\nmagazine of love and of true and sweet ideas.\n\nNext in order come the men with more _Rajas_ , or activity, combative natures,\nwho take up the ideas of the perfect ones and preach them to the world. The\nhighest kind of men silently collect true and noble ideas, and others--the\nBuddhas and Christs--go from place to place preaching them and working for\nthem. In the life of Gautama Buddha we notice him constantly saying that he is\nthe twenty-fifth Buddha. The twenty-four before him are unknown to history,\nalthough the Buddha known to\n\np. 104\n\nhistory must have built upon foundations laid by them. The highest men are\ncalm, silent and unknown. They are the men who really know the power of\nthought; they are sure that, even if they go into a cave and close the door\nand simply think five true thoughts and then pass away, these five thoughts of\ntheir will live through eternity. Indeed such thoughts will penetrate through\nthe mountains, cross the oceans, and travel through the world. They will enter\ndeep into human hearts and brains and raise up men and women who will give\nthem practical expression in the workings of human life. These _S attvika_ men\nare too near the Lord to be active and to fight, to be working, struggling,\npreaching and doing good, as they say, here on earth to humanity. The active\nworkers, however good, have still a little remnant of ignorance left in them.\nWhen our nature has yet some impurities left in it, then alone can we work. It\nis in the nature of work to be impelled ordinarily by motive and by\nattachment. In the presence of an ever active Providence who notes even the\nsparrows fall, how can man attach any importance to his own work? Will it not\nbe a blasphemy to do so when we know that He is taking care of the minutest\nthings in the world? We have only to stand in awe and reverence before Him\nsaying, "Thy will be done." The highest men cannot work, for in them there is\nno attachment. Those whose whole soul is gone into the Self, those whose\ndesires are confined in the Self, who have become ever associated with the\nSelf, for them there is no work. Such are indeed the highest of mankind; but\napart from them every one else has to work. In so working we should never\nthink that we can help on even the least thing in this universe. We cannot. We\nonly help ourselves in this gymnasium of the world. This is the proper\nattitude of work. If we work in this way, if we always remember that our\npresent opportunity to work thus is a privilege which has been given to us, we\nshall never be attached to anything.\n\np. 105\n\n[paragraph continues] Millions like you and me think that we are great people\nin the world; but we all die, and in five minutes the world will have\nforgotten us. But the life of God is infinite. "Who can live a moment, breathe\na moment, if this all-powerful One does not will it?" He is the ever active\nProvidence. All power is His and within His command. Through His command the\nwinds blow, the sun shines, the earth lives, and death stalks upon the earth.\nHe is the all in all; He is all and in all. We can only worship Him. Give up\nall fruits of work; do good for its own sake; then alone will come perfect\nnon-attachment. The bonds of the heart will thus break, and we shall reap\nperfect freedom. This freedom is indeed the goal of _Karma-Yoga_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VIII. The Ideal of Karma-Yoga](kyog08.htm)\n\n'
