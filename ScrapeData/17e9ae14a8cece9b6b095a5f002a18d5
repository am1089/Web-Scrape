(The Self to be seen, to be heard, &c. is the highest Self) on account of\nthe connected meaning of the sentences.\n\nWe read in the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, in the Maitreyi-brahma _n_ a the\nfollowing passage, 'Verily, a husband is not dear that you may love the\nhusband, &c. &c.; verily, everything is not dear that you may love everything;\nbut that you may love the Self therefore everything is dear. Verily, the Self\nis to be seen, to be heard, to be perceived, to be marked, O Maitreyi! When\nthe Self has been seen, heard, perceived, and known, then all this is known'\n(B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 6).--Here the doubt arises whether that which is\nrepresented as the object to be seen, to be heard, and so on, is the\ncognitional Self (the individual soul) or the highest Self.--But whence the\ndoubt?--Because, we reply, the Self is, on the one hand, by the mention of\ndear things such as husband and so on, indicated as the enjoyer whence it\nappears that the passage refers to the individual soul; and because, on the\nother hand, the declaration that through the knowledge of the Self everything\nbecomes known points to the highest Self.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the passage refers to the individual soul, on\naccount of the strength of the initial statement. The text declares at the\noutset that all the objects of enjoyment found in this world, such as husband,\nwife, riches, and so on, are dear on account of the Self, and thereby gives us\nto understand that the enjoying (i.e. the\n\np. 275\n\nindividual) Self is meant; if thereupon it refers to the Self as the object of\nsight and so on, what other Self should it mean than the same individual Self?\n--A subsequent passage also (viz. 'Thus does this great Being, endless,\nunlimited. consisting of nothing but knowledge, rise from out of these\nelements, and vanish again after them. When he has departed there is no more\nknowledge'), which describes how the great Being under discussion rises, as\nthe Self of knowledge, from the elements, shows that the object of sight is no\nother than the cognitional Self, i.e. the individual soul. The concluding\nclause finally, 'How, O beloved, should he know the knower?' shows, by means\nof the term 'knower,' which denotes an agent, that the individual soul is\nmeant. The declaration that through the cognition of the Self everything\nbecomes known must therefore not be interpreted in the literal sense, but must\nbe taken to mean that the world of objects of enjoyment is known through its\nrelation to the enjoying soul.\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--The passage makes a statement about the\nhighest Self, on account of the connected meaning of the entire section. If we\nconsider the different passages in their mutual connexion, we find that they\nall refer to the highest Self. After Maitreyi has heard from Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya\nthat there is no hope of immortality by wealth, she expresses her desire of\nimmortality in the words, 'What should I do with that by which I do not become\nimmortal? What my Lord knoweth tell that to me; and thereupon Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya\nexpounds to her the knowledge of the Self. Now Scripture as well as Sm _ri_ ti\ndeclares that immortality is not to be reached but through the knowledge of\nthe highest Self.--The statement further that through the knowledge of the\nSelf everything becomes known can be taken in its direct literal sense only if\nby the Self we understand the highest cause. And to take it in a non-literal\nsense (as the purvapakshin proposes) is inadmissible, on account of the\nexplanation given of that statement in a subsequent passage, viz. 'Whosoever\nlooks for the Brahman class elsewhere than in the Self, is abandoned by the\nBrahman class.' Here it is said that whoever\n\np. 276\n\nerroneously views this world with its Brahmans and so on, as having an\nindependent existence apart from the Self, is abandoned by that very world of\nwhich he has taken an erroneous view; whereby the view that there exists any\ndifference is refuted. And the immediately subsequent clause, 'This everything\nis the Self,' gives us to understand that the entire aggregate of existing\nthings is non-different from the Self; a doctrine further confirmed by the\nsimiles of the drum and so on.--By explaining further that the Self about\nwhich he had been speaking is the cause of the universe of names, forms, and\nworks ('There has been breathed forth from this great Being what we have as\n_Ri_ g-veda,' &c.) Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya again shows that it is the highest Self.--\nTo the same conclusion he leads us by declaring, in the paragraph which treats\nof the natural centres of things, that the Self is the centre of the whole\nworld with the objects, the senses and the mind, that it has neither inside\nnor outside, that it is altogether a mass of knowledge.--From all this it\nfollows that what the text represents as the object of sight and so on is the\nhighest Self.\n\nWe now turn to the remark made by the purvapakshin that the passage teaches\nthe individual soul to be the object of sight, because it is, in the early\npart of the chapter denoted as something dear.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 20](sbe34131.htm)\n\n"
