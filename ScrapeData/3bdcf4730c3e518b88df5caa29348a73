And on account of there being observed in that (small ether), supporting\nwhich is a greatness of that (i. e. Brahman).\n\nIn continuation of the passage 'It is the Self free from Sin,' &c., which\nrefers to the small ether, the text says: 'it is a bank, a limitary support,\nthat these worlds may not be confounded.' What the text here says about the\nsmall ether supporting the world proves it to be the highest Brahman; for to\nsupport the world is the glory of Brahman. Compare 'He is the Lord of all, the\nking of all things, the protector of all things. He is a bank and a boundary,\nso that these worlds may not be confounded' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22); 'By the\ncommand of that Imperishable, O Gargi, heaven and earth stand, held apart' (B\n_ri_. Up. III, 8, 9). Now this specific greatness of the highest Brahman,\nwhich consists in its supporting the world, is also observed in the small\nether--which proves the latter to be none other than Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 16.
