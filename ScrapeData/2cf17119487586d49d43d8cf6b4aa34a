What that Soul of Souls,  \nThe ADHYATMAN? What, Thou Best of All!  \nThy work, the KARMA? Tell me what it is  \nThou namest ADHIBHUTA? What again  \nMeans ADHIDAIVA? Yea, and how it comes  \nThou canst be ADHIYAJNA in thy flesh?  \nSlayer of Madhu! Further, make me know  \nHow good men find thee in the hour of death?  \nKrishna. I BRAHMA am! the One Eternal GOD,  \nAnd ADHYATMAN is My Being\'s name,  \nThe Soul of Souls! What goeth forth from Me,  \nCausing all life to live, is KARMA called:  \nAnd, Manifested in divided forms,  \nI am the ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Lives;  \nAnd ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods,  \nBecause I am PURUSHA, who who begets.  \nAnd ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice,  \nI- speaking with thee in this body here-  \nAm, thou embodied one! (for all the shrines  \nFlame unto Me!) And, at the hour of death,  \nHe that hath meditated Me alone,  \nIn putting off his flesh, comes forth to Me,  \nEnters into My Being- doubt thou not!  \nBut, if he meditated otherwise  \nAt hour of death, in putting off the flesh,  \nHe goes to what he looked for, Kunti\'s Son!  \nBecause the Soul is fashioned to its like.\n\nHave Me, then, in thy heart always! and fight!  \nThou too, when heart and mind are fixed on Me,  \nShalt surely come to Me! All come who cleave  \nWith never-wavering will of firmest faith,  \nOwning none other Gods: all come to Me,  \nThe Uttermost, Purusha, Holiest!\n\nWhoso hath known Me, Lord of sage and singer,  \nAncient of days; of all the Three Worlds Stay,  \nBoundless,- but unto every atom Bringer  \nOf that which quickens it: whoso, I say,\n\nHath known My form, which passeth mortal knowing;  \nSeen my effulgence- which no eye hath seen-  \nThan the sun\'s burning gold more brightly glowing,  \nDispersing darkness,- unto him hath been\n\nRight life! And, in the hour when life is ending,  \nWith mind set fast and trustful piety,  \nDrawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending,  \nIn happy peace that faithful one doth die,-\n\nIn glad peace passeth to Purusha\'s heaven.  \nThe place which they who read the Vedas name  \nAKSHARAM, "Ultimate;" whereto have striven  \nSaints and ascetics- their road is the same.\n\nThat way- the highest way- goes he who shuts  \nThe gates of all his senses, locks desire  \nSafe in his heart, centres the vital airs  \nUpon his parting thought, steadfastly set;  \nAnd, murmuring OM, the sacred syllable-  \nEmblem of BRAHM- dies, meditating Me.\n\nFor who, none other Gods regarding, looks  \nEver to Me, easily am I gained  \nBy such a Yogi; and, attaining Me,  \nThey fall not- those Mahatmas- back to birth,  \nTo life, which is the place of pain, which ends,  \nBut take the way of utmost blessedness.\n\nThe worlds, Arjuna!- even Brahma\'s world-  \nRoll back again from Death to Life\'s unrest;  \nBut they, O Kunti\'s Son! that reach to Me,  \nTaste birth no more. If ye know Brahma\'s Day  \nWhich is a thousand Yugas; if ye know  \nThe thousand Yugas making Brahma\'s Night,  \nThen know ye Day and Night as He doth know!  \nWhen that vast Dawn doth break, th\' Invisible  \nIs brought anew into the Visible;  \nWhen that deep Night doth darken, all which is  \nFades back again to Him Who sent it forth;  \nYea! this vast company of living things-  \nAgain and yet again produced- expires  \nAt Brahma\'s Nightfall; and, at Brahma\'s Dawn,  \nRiseth, without its will, to life new-born.  \nBut- higher, deeper, innermost- abides  \nAnother Life, not like the life of sense,  \nEscaping sight, unchanging. This endures  \nWhen all created things have passed away;  \nThis is that Life named the Unmanifest,  \nThe Infinite! the All! the Uttermost.  \nThither arriving none return. That Life  \nIs Mine, and I am there! And, Prince! by faith  \nWhich wanders not, there is a way to come  \nThither. I, the PURUSHA, I Who spread  \nThe Universe around me- in Whom dwell  \nAll living Things- may so be reached and seen!\n\nRicher than holy fruit on Vedas growing,  \nGreater than gifts, better than prayer or fast,  \nSuch wisdom is! The Yogi, this way knowing,  \nComes to the Utmost Perfect Peace at last.\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER VIII OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA;  \nEntitled "Aksharaparabrahmayog,"  \nOr "The Book of Religion by Devotion  \nto the One Supreme God."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 9: Of Religion by the Kingly Knowledge and the Kingly\nMystery](bg09.htm)\n\n'
