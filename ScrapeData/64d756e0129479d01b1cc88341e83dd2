We owe\nthe preservation of its Dharma-sutra probably to the special law schools of\nIndia, which, attracted as it would seem by its title and the legend\nconnecting it with Vasish _th_ a Maitravaru _n_ i, one of the most famous _Ri_\nshis of the Rig-veda and a redoubtable champion of Brahmanism, made it one of\ntheir standard authorities. The early existence of a legend according to which\nthe Vasish _th_ a Dharma-sutra was considered either to be a work composed by\nthe _Ri_ shi Vasish _th_ a, or at least to contain the sum of his teaching on\nthe duty of man, is indicated by several passages of the work itself. For the\nDharma-sutra names Vasish _th_ a, or appeals to his authority on no less than\nthree occasions. First, we find a rule on lawful interest, which is\nemphatically ascribed to Vasish _th_ a 1. 'Learn the interest for a money\nlender,' the Sutra says, 'declared by the word of Vasish _th_ a; five mashas\n(may be taken) for twenty (karshapa _n_ as every month).' Again, at the end of\na long string of rules 2 which contain the observances to be kept by sinners\nwho undergo K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penances, Vasish _th_ a's name is brought\nforward as the authority for them, and the last words are, 'Thus speaks the\ndivine Vasish _th_ a.' Finally, the concluding Sutra of the whole work 3 gives\n\np. xii\n\nexpression to the devotion felt by the author for the _Ri_ shi, 'Adoration to\nVasish _th_ a, _S_ atayatu, the son of Mitra and Varu _n_ a and of Urva _s_\ni.' The epithets used in this last passage conclusively show that the Vasish\n_th_ a after whom the Dharma-sutra is named, is the individual who, according\nto the Brahmanical tradition, is the _Ri_ shi of a large portion of the\nseventh Ma _n_ _d_ ala of the Rig-veda and the progenitor of the Vasish _th_ a\nclan of Brahmans, and who in some hymns of the Rig-veda appears as the\npurohita or domestic priest of king Sudas and the rival of Vi _s_ vamitra, and\nin other Suktas as a half mythical being. For the verses Rig-veda VII, 33,\n11-14 trace the origin of this Vasish _th_ a to the two sons of Aditi, Mitra\nand Varu _n_ a, and to the Apsaras Urva _s_ i, and contain the outline of the\ncurious, but disgusting story of his marvellous birth, which Saya _n_ a\nnarrates more circumstantially in the commentary on verse 11. Moreover, the\nword _S_ atayatu, which in the Dharma-sutra is used as an epithet of Vasish\n_th_ a, occurs Rig-veda VII, 18, 21 in close connexion with the _Ri_ shi's\nname. Saya _n_ a explains it in his commentary on the latter passage as 'the\ndestroyer of many demons,' or, 'he whom many demons seek to destroy,' and\ntakes it as an epithet of the sage Para _s_ ara, who is named together with\nVasish _th_ a. It would, however, seem that, if the verse is construed on\nstrictly philological principles, neither Saya _n_ a's interpretation, nor\nthat suggested by the Dharma-sutra can be accepted, and that _S_ atayatu has\nto be taken as a proper name 1. But, however that may be, it is not doubtful\nthat we may safely infer from the expressions used in the last sentence of the\nDharma-sutra, that the Vasish _th_ a to whom the invocation is addressed and\nthe composition of the work is ascribed, either immediately or through the\nmedium of pupils, is the individual named in the Rig-veda. The connexion of\nthe Dharma-sutra with one of the _Ri_ shis of the Rig-veda which is thus\nestablished, possesses a particular interest and importance, because it\ncorroborates the statement of Govindasvamin, the commentator of Baudhayana,\nthat the Institutes of Vasish _th_ a were\n\np. xiii\n\noriginally studied by and authoritative for the Bahv _ri_ _k_ as, the _Ri_\ngvedins alone, and afterwards became an authority for all Brahmans 1. In the\nintroduction to Gautama it has been shown that a similar assertion which\nGovinda makes with regard to the Gautama Dharma-sutra can be corroborated by a\nconsiderable amount of external and internal evidence. It has been pointed out\nthat not only the fact that the spiritual pedigrees of the _Kh_ andoga schools\nenumerate several Gautamas, but also the partiality for texts of the Sama-\nveda, which the Institutes of Gautama show on several occasions, strongly\nsupport the tradition that the Gautamiya Dharma _s_ astra originally was the\nexclusive property of a school of Samavedins. In the case of the Vasish _th_ a\nDharma _s_ astra indications of the latter kind are, if not entirely wanting,\nat least very faint. The number of Vedic passages quoted is, no doubt, large;\nbut few among them belong to the class of Mantras which are recited during the\nperformance of g _ri_ hya rites, and must be taken from the particular\nrecension of the Veda to which the performer belongs. Besides, the texts of\nthis description which actually occur, do not bear the mark of a particular\nVeda or _S_ akha. The numerous texts, on the other hand, which are quoted in\nsupport or explanation of the rules, are taken impartially from all the three\nancient Vedas. For this reason it would be dangerous to use the references to\na dozen _Ri_ _k_ as in chapters XVII and XXVI, as well as to the legend of\nSuna _h_ sepa, which is told only in works belonging to the Rig-veda,\n\np. xiv\n\nas a proof that the Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra is the work of a _Ri_\ngvedin. Under these circumstances the three passages, mentioning Vasish _th_\na's name, and especially the last which identifies him with the _Ri_ shi of\nthe Rig-veda, have a particularly great importance, as they are the only\npieces of internal evidence which can be brought forward in favour of\nGovindasvamin's valuable statement. But the latter is, even without any\nfurther corroboration, credible enough, because no reason is apparent why\nGovinda should have invented such a story, and because his assertion fully\nagrees with the well-established facts known about the other existing Dharma-\nsutras, which all were composed not for the benefit of the \xc3\x82ryans in general,\nbut in order to regulate the conduct of particular sections of the\nBrahmanical, community.\n\nThere is, however, one point in Govindasvamin's statement which requires\nfurther elucidation. He says that the Bahv _ri_ _k_ as, i.e. the _Ri_ gvedins\nin general, formerly studied the Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra. It might,\ntherefore, be inferred that the work possessed equal authority among the A _s_\nvalayaniyas, the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khayaniyas, the Ma _n_ _d_ ukayanas, and all the other\nschools of the Rig-veda, and that it belonged to the most ancient heirlooms of\nits adherents. That is, however, improbable for several reasons. For, first,\nneither the A _s_ valayaniyas nor the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khayaniyas of the present day study\nor attach any special importance to the Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra.\nSecondly, if the Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra had ever been the common\nauthority on Dharma in all the different schools of the Rig-veda, it would be\nnecessary to ascribe to it an antiquity which it clearly does not possess. All\nSutras were originally composed for a single school only. Where we find that\nthe same Sutra is adopted by several _K_ ara _n_ as, as is the case with the\nDharma-sutra, which both the \xc3\x82pastambiyas and the Haira _n_ yake _s_ as study,\nand with the _K_ ayana-sutra, which the Bharadva _g_ as and the Haira _n_ yake\n_s_ as have in common, it is evident that the later school did not care to\ncompose a treatise of its own on a certain subject, but preferred to take over\nthe composition of an earlier teacher, If, now, a Sutra on a certain\n\np. xv\n\nsubject were acknowledged by all the schools of one Veda, it would follow that\nit must belong to the most ancient books of that Veda, and must have been\nadopted successively by all its later schools. In such a case the Sutra must\ncertainly show signs of its great antiquity. But if we look for the latter in\nthe Vasish _th_ a Dharma-sutra, the trouble will be in vain. Though that work\ncontains a good deal that is archaic, yet, as will be shown presently, its\nnumerous quotations from Vedic writings and older Dharma-sutras clearly prove\nthat it does not belong to the oldest productions of its class, but takes even\namong the still existing Institutes of the Sacred Law only a secondary rank.\nUnder these circumstances the correct interpretation of Govindasvamin's words\nwill be, that according to the Brahmanical tradition, known to him, some\nschool of _Ri_ gvedins, the name of which he did not know, or did not care to\ngive, originally possessed the Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra as its exclusive\nproperty, and that the work later, through the action of the special law\nschools, acquired general authority for all Brahmans. It is a pity that no\nauthentic information regarding the name of that school of _Ri_ gvedins has\nbeen handed down. But, considering the fact that Vedic schools are frequently\nnamed after Vedic _Ri_ shis, it seems not improbable that it was called after\nthe Vasish _th_ a whose authority the Dharma-sutra invokes, and that we may\nassume the former existence of a Vasish _th_ a school, a Sutra- _k_ ara _n_ a,\nof the Rig-veda 1, founded perhaps by a teacher of the Vasish _th_ a gotra.\nThis conjecture, which, it must be confessed, is not supported by any\ncorroborative evidence from the Brahmanical tradition, will explain why the\ntitle-pages of this and of the first part speak of a school of Vasish _th_ a.\n\nThe position of the Vasish _th_ a Dharma-sutra in Vedic literature can be\ndefined, to a certain extent, by an analysis\n\np. xvi\n\nof its numerous quotations from the Sa _m_ hitas, Brahma _n_ as, and the older\nSutras. By this means it will become evident that the work belongs to a period\nwhen the chief schools of the three ancient Vedas had been formed and some of\nthe still existing Dharma-sutras had been composed. Faint indications will be\nfound which make it probable that the home of the school to which it belonged,\nlay in the northern half of India, north of the Narmada and of the Vindhyas,\nAs regards the quotations from the _S_ ruti, the revealed texts of the Hindus,\nthey are chiefly taken from the Rig-veda and from three recensions of the Ya\n_g_ ur-veda. Passages from the Rig-veda-sa _m_ hita are quoted IV, 21; XVII, 3\n--4; and XXVI, 5-7. With respect to the quotations in the latter chapter it\nmust, however, be noted that its genuineness is, as will be shown in the\nsequel, not above suspicion. A Brahma _n_ a of the Rig-veda seems to be\nreferred to in XVII, 2, 32, 35. But the extracts, given there, agree only in\npart with the text of the Aitareya, and it is probable that they are taken\nfrom some lost composition of the same class. A curious Sutra, II, 35, shows a\ngreat resemblance to the explanations of Vedic passages given by Yaska in the\nNirukta 1. The passage points either to a connexion of the author with the\nschool of the Nairuktas or, at least, to an acquaintance with its principles.\nAmong the schools of the Ya _g_ ur-veda, that of the Ka _th_ as is twice\nreferred to by name, XII, 29; XXX, 5. But Professor Weber, who kindly looked\nfor the quotations in the Berlin MS. of the Ka _th_ aka, has not been able to\nfind them. A. third passage, I, 37, said to be taken from the _K_ aturmasyas,\ni.e. the portion of a Sa _m_ hita which treats of the _K_ aturmasya\nsacrifices, actually occurs in the Ka _th_ aka. But, as it is likewise found\nin the _K_ aturmasya-ka _n_ _d_ a of the Maitraya _n_ iyas, it must remain\nuncertain from which of the two recensions of the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda it has\nbeen quoted. The chapter on the duties of women, vers. 6-8, contains a\n\np. xvii\n\nlong quotation which, in spite of some small discrepancies, seems to have been\ntaken from the Taittiriya-sa _m_ hita of the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda. Passages of\nthe Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka are quoted or referred to X, 35 and XXIII, 23. The\nWhite Ya _g_ ur-veda is mentioned several times as the Va _g_ asaneyi- _s_\nakha or the Va _g_ asaneyaka. The former expression occurs III, 19 and XXIII,\n13. The quotations, marked as taken from the Va _g_ asaneyaka, XII, 31, XIV,\n46 are found in the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a, and another passage of the same\nwork is quoted I, 45, without a specification of the source. A very clear\nproof that the author of the Dharma-sutra knew the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita\nis furnished by the Mantra, given II, 34. The text, quoted there, occurs in\nthree different _S_ akhas, that of the Va _g_ asaneyins, that of the\nTaittiriyas and the Atharva-veda, and in each shows a few variae lectiones.\nIts wording in the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita literally agrees with the\nversion, given in the Sutra. The Sama-veda is referred to III, 19, and\nparticular Samans are mentioned in the borrowed chapter XXII, 9. A passage\nfrom the Nidana, probably a work on Stomas and metres, which belonged to the\nBhallavins, an ancient school of Samavedins, occurs I, 14-16. An Upanishad,\nconnected with the Atharva-veda, the Atharva _s_ iras, is mentioned in the\nborrowed chapter XXII, 9, and the existence of the Atharva-veda is\npresupposed, also, by 'the vows called _S_ iras,' which are alluded to in the\nsuspicious chapter XXVI, 11, and are said to be peculiar to the Atharvavedins\n1. The chapters, which are undoubtedly genuine, contain no allusion to the\nfourth Veda.\n\nAs regards the older works on Dharma, the author of the Institutes of Vasish\n_th_ a certainly knew and used a treatise, attributed to Yama, the Dharma-\nsutras of Manu, Harita and Gautama, and perhaps that of Baudhayana. With\nrespect to two verses, which, as the Sutra says, were proclaimed by Pra _g_\napati, XIV, 24, 30, it is somewhat doubtful, if it is meant that they have\nbeen taken from a work, attributed to Pra _g_ apati, or that they are merely\nutterances, supposed to have been made by that deity for the benefit\n\np. xviii\n\nof mankind. The latter view seems, however, the more likely one, as it is\ncustomary in the Sm _ri_ tis to ascribe the revelation of social institutions,\nceremonies, and penances to Pra _g_ apati, who, in the older works, occupies\nmuch the same position as Brahma, the creator, in the later religious systems.\nIt is not impossible that some of the references to Yama, e.g. XI, 20, have to\nbe explained in the same manner. But other passages, attributed to Yama, e.g.\nXVIII, 13-26, seem to have been taken from a work which was considered the\nproduction of the Dharmara _g_ a. Of course, none of the Yamasm _ri_ tis,\nwhich exist in the present day, can be meant. The quotations from Manu are\nnumerous 1. They have all been taken from a book attributed to a Manu, and\npossess a very high interest for the history of the present metrical Manusm\n_ri_ ti. For the prose passage from the Manava, given IV, 5, furnishes the\nproof that the author of the Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra quotes from a\nDharma-sutra attributed to a Manu, while other quotations show that the Manava\nDharma-sutra contained, also, verses, some of which, e.g. XIX, 37, were Trish\n_t_ ubhs, and that a large proportion of these verses has been embodied in Bh\n_ri_ gu's version of the Manusm _ri_ ti. Fifteen years ago 2 I first called\nattention to Vasish _th_ a's prose quotation from the Manava, and pointed out\nthat, if the MSS. of the Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra were to be trusted, a\nsmall piece of the lost Manava Dharma-sutra, on which the present Manusm _ri_\nti is based, had been found. The incorrectness and the defective state of the\nmaterials which I then had at my disposal did not allow me to go further.\nSince that time several, comparatively speaking, good MSS. of the Institutes\nof Vasish _th_ a and many inferior ones have been found, and all, at least all\nthose which I have examined, give the quotation in prose exactly in the same\nform. The fact that Vasish _th_ a gives, in IV, 5, a prose quotation from Manu\nmay, therefore, be considered as certain 3. Moreover several of the best MSS.\n\np. xix\n\nshow, by adding the particle 'iti' at the end of Sutra 8, that the quotation\nfrom the Manava is not finished with Sutra 5, but includes the two verses\ngiven in Sutras 6 and 7 and the second prose passage in Sutra 8. Among the\nverses the first is found entire in the metrical Manusm _ri_ ti, and the\nsecond has likewise a representative in that work, though its concluding\nportion has been altered in such a manner that the permission to slaughter\nanimals at sacrifices has been converted into an absolute prohibition to take\nanimal life. Sutra 8, which again is in prose, has no counterpart in the\nmetrical Manusm _ri_ ti, as might be expected from its allowing 'a full-grown\nox' or 'a full-grown he-goat' to be killed in honour of a distinguished Brahma\n_n_ a or Kshatriya guest. A closely corresponding passage is found in the _S_\natapatha-brahma _n_ a, and a verse expressing the same opinion in the Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya Sm _ri_ ti, the versification of a Dharma-sutra of the White Ya\n_g_ ur-veda. As the last part of the quotation resembles the text of the\nBrahma _n_ a and its language is very archaic, it is quite possible that,\nthough belonging to the passage from the Manava-sutra, it contains a Vedic\ntext, taken from some hitherto unknown Brahma _n_ a which Manu adduced in\nsupport of his opinion. On this supposition the arrangement of the whole\nquotation would be as follows. Sutra 5 would give the original rule of the\nauthor of the Manava in an aphoristic form; Sutras 6-7 would repeat the same\nopinion in verse, the latter being probably _S_ lokas current among the\nBrahmanical community; and Sutra 8 would give the Vedic authority for the\npreceding sentences. This arrangement would be in strict conformity with the\nplan usually followed by the authors of Dharma-sutras. But whether Sutra 8\ncontains a second original aphorism of the Manava Dharma-sutra or a. Vedic\npassage, it seems in-disputable that the author of the Vasish _th_ a Dharma-\nsutra knew a treatise attributed to a teacher called Manu, which, like all\nother Dharma-sutras, was partly written in aphoristic\n\np. xx\n\nprose and partly in verse. The passage furnishes, therefore, the proof for\nProfessor Max Muller's conjecture that our metrical Manusm _ri_ ti, like all\nthe older works of the same class, is based on the Dharma-sutra of a Vedic\nSutra- _k_ ara _n_ a. In connexion with this subject it maybe mentioned that\nthe Institutes of Vasish _th_ a contain, besides the above-mentioned passages,\nno less than thirty-nine verses 1, which are not marked as quotations, but\noccur in Bh _ri_ gu's metrical Manusa _m_ hita. Some of them present more or\nless important variae lectiones. Moreover, there are four verses which, though\nVasish _th_ a attributes them to Harita and Yama 2, are included in our Manusm\n_ri_ ti and treated as utterances of the father of mankind. The bearing of\nboth these facts on the history of the Manusm _ri_ ti is obvious. But the\nfrequency of the references to or quotations from Manu which Vasish _th_ a\nmakes, teaches another important lesson. Like the fact that Manu is the only\nindividual author to whom Gautama refers 3, it shows that in ancient times\nManu's name had as great a charm for the Brahman teachers as it has for those\nof the present day, and that the--old Manava Dharma-sutra was one of the\nleading works- on the subject, or, perhaps, even held that dominant position\nwhich the metrical Manusm _ri_ ti. actually occupied in the Middle Ages and\ntheoretically occupies in our days. It is interesting to observe that\nprecisely the same inference can be drawn from the early Sanskrit\ninscriptions. If these speak of individual authors of Sm _ri_ tis, they\ninvariably place Manu's name first 4.\n\nVasish _th_ a gives only one quotation from Harita, II, 6. Harita was one of\nthe ancient Sutrakaras of the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda, who is known also to\nBaudhayana. From a passage which K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita quotes in\nelucidation of\n\np. xxi\n\n[paragraph continues] Vasish _th_ a XXIV, 6, I conclude that Harita was a\nMaitraya _n_ iya 1. The relation of the Vasish _th_ a Dharma-sutra to Gautama\nand Baudhayana has already been discussed in the introduction to the\ntranslation of the former work 2. To the remarks on its connexion with\nBaudhayana it must be added that the third Pra _s_ na of the Baudhayana\nDharma-sutra, from which Vasish _th_ a's twenty-second chapter seems to have\nbeen borrowed, perhaps does not belong to the original work, but is a later,\nthough presumably a very ancient, addition to the composition of the founder\nof the Baudhayana school. The reasons for this opinion will be given below. If\nBaudhayana's third Pra _s_ na is not genuine, but has been added by a later\nteacher of that school, the interval between Baudhayana and the author of the\nVasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra must be a very considerable one. I have,\nhowever, to point out that the inference regarding the priority of Baudhayana\nto Vasish _th_ a is permissible only on the sup-position that Vasish _th_ a's\ntwenty-second chapter is not a later addition to the latter work, and that,\nthough it is found in all our MSS., this fact is not sufficient to silence all\ndoubts which might be raised with respect to its genuineness; for we shall see\npresently that other chapters in the section on penances have been tampered\nwith by a later hand. It will, therefore, be advisable not to insist too\nstrongly on the certainty of the conclusion that Vasish _th_ a knew and used\nBaudhayana's work.\n\nIn the introduction to his translation of the Vish _n_ usm _ri_ ti 3,\nProfessor Jolly has pointed out two passages of Vasish _th_ a which, as he\nthinks, have been borrowed from Vish _n_ u, and prove the posteriority of the\nVasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra, if not to the Vish _n_ usm _ri_ ti, at least\nto its original, the Ka _th_ aka Dharma-sutra. He contends that the passage\nVasish _th_ a XXVIII, 20-15 is a versification of the Sutras of Vish _n_ u\nLVI, which, besides being clumsy, shows a number of\n\np. xxii\n\ncorruptions and grammatical mistakes, and that Vasish _th_ a XXVIII, 18--22\nhas been borrowed from Vish _n_ u LXXXVII. Professor Jolly's assertion\nregarding the second passage involves, however, a little mistake. For the\nfirst two _S_ lokas, Vasish _th_ a XXVIII, 18-19, describe not the gift of the\nskin of a black antelope, which is mentioned in the first six Sutras of Vish\n_n_ u LXXXVII, but the rite of feeding Brahmans with honey and sesamum grains,\nwhich occurs Vish _n_ u XC, 10. The three verses, Vasish _th_ a XXVIII, 20--\n22, on the other hand, really are the same as those given by Vish _n_ u\nLXXXVII, 8-10. It is, however, expressly stated in the Vish _n_ usm _ri_ ti\nthat they contain a quotation, and are not the original composition of the\nauthor of the Dharma-sutra. Hence no inference can be drawn from the\nrecurrence of the same stanzas in the Vasish _th_ a Dharma-sutra. As regards\nthe other passage, Vasish _th_ a XXVIII, 10-15, Professor Jolly is quite right\nin saying that it is a clumsy versification of Vish _n_ u's Sutras, and it is\nnot at all improbable that Vasish _th_ a's verses may have been immediately\nderived from the Ka _th_ aka. The further inference as to the priority of the\nancient Ka _th_ aka-sutra to Vasish _th_ a, which Professor Jolly draws from\nthe comparison of the two passages, would also be unimpeachable, if the\ngenuineness of Vasish _th_ a's twenty-eighth chapter were certain. But that is\nunfortunately not the case. Not only that chapter, but the preceding ones, XXV\n--XXVII, in fact the whole section on secret penances, are, in my opinion, not\nonly suspicious, but certainly betray the hand of a later restorer and\ncorrector. Everybody who carefully reads the Sanskrit text of the Dharma-sutra\nwill be struck by the change of the style and the difference in the language\nwhich the four chapters on secret penances show, as compared with the\npreceding and following sections. Throughout the whole of the first twenty-\nfour chapters and in the last two chapters we find a mixture of prose and\nverse. With one exception in the sixth chapter, where thirty-one verses form\nthe beginning of the section on the rule of conduct, the author follows always\none and the same plan in arranging his materials. His own rules are given\nfirst in the form of aphorisms, and after\n\np. xxiii\n\nthese follow the authorities for his doctrines, which consist either of Vedic\npassages or of verses, the latter being partly quotations taken from\nindividual authors or works, partly specimens of the versified maxims current\namong the Brahmans, and sometimes memorial verses composed by the author\nhimself. But chapters XXV--XXVIII contain not a single Sutra. They are made up\nentirely of Anush _t_ ubh _S_ lokas, and the phrases 1 'I will now declare,'\n'Listen to my words,' which are so characteristic of the style of the later\nmetrical Sm _ri_ tis and of the Pura _n_ as, occur more frequently than is\nabsolutely necessary. Again, in the first twenty-four and the last two\nchapters the language is archaic Sanskrit, interspersed here and there with\nVedic anomalous forms. But in the four chapters on secret penances we have the\ncommon Sanskrit of the metrical Sm _ri_ tis and Pura _n_ as, with its\nincorrect forms, adopted in order to fit inconvenient words into the metre.\nNor is this all. The contents of a portion of this suspicious section are\nmerely useless repetitions of matters dealt with already in the preceding\nchapters, while some verses contain fragmentary rules on a subject which is\ntreated more fully further on. Thus the description of the K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra\nand _K_ andraya _n_ a penances, which has been given XXI, 20 and XXIV, 45, is\nrepeated XXVII, 16, 21. Further, the enumeration of the purificatory texts\nXXVIII, 10-15 is merely an enlargement of XXII, 9. Finally, the verses XXVIII,\n16-22 contain detached rules on gifts, and in the next chapter, XXIX, the\nsubject is begun once more and treated at considerable length. Though it would\nbe unwise to assume that all genuine productions of the old Sutrakaras must,\nthroughout, show regularity and consistency, the differences between the four\nchapters and the remainder of the work, just pointed out, are, it seems to me,\nsufficient to warrant the conclusion that they do not belong to the author of\nthe Institutes. Under these circumstances it might be assumed that the whole\nsection is simply an interpolation. But that would be going too far. For, as\nother Dharma-sutras show, one or even several chapters on secret penances\nbelonged to such works.\n\np. xxiv\n\n[paragraph continues] Moreover, in the section on women, Vasish _th_ a V, 3-4,\nthe author makes a cross-reference to the rahasyas, the section on secret\npenances, and quotes by anticipation half a _S_ loka which is actually found\nin chapter XXVIII. The inference to be drawn from these facts is, that the\nsection on secret penances is not simply a later addition intended to supply\nan omission of the first writer, but that, for some reason or other, it has\nbeen remodelled. The answer to the question why this was done is suggested, it\nseems to me, partly by the state of the MSS. of the Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_\nastra, and partly by the facts connected with the treatment of ancient works\nby the Pa _n_ _d_ its, which my examination of the libraries of Northern India\nhas brought to light 1. MSS. of the Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra are very\nrare,. and among those found only three are complete. Some stop with chapter\nX, others with chapter XXI, and a few in the middle of the thirtieth Adhyaya.\nMoreover, most of them are very corrupt, .and even the best exhibit some\nSutras which are hopeless. These circumstances show clearly that after the\nextinction of the Vedic school, with which the work originated, the Sutra was\nfor some time neglected, and existed in a few copies only, perhaps even in a\nsingle MS. The materials on which the ancient Hindus wrote, the birch bark and\nthe palm leaves, are so frail that especially the first and last leaves of a\nPothi are easily lost or badly damaged. Instances of this kind are common\nenough in the _G_ aina and Ka _s_ mir libraries, where the beginning and still\nmore frequently the end of many works have been irretrievably lost. The fate\nof the Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra, it would seem, has been similar. The\nfacts related above make it probable that the MS. or MSS. which came into the\nhands of the Pa _n_ _d_ its of the special law schools, who revived the study\nof the work, was defective. Pieces of the last leaves which remained, probably\nshowed the extent of the damage done, and the. Pa _n_ _d_ its set to work at\nthe restoration of the lost portions, just as the Ka _s_ mirian Sahebram Pa\n_n_ _d_ it restored the Nilamata-pura _n_ a for Mahara _g_ a Ra _n_ avira _s_\ni _m_ ha. They,\n\np. xxv\n\nof course, used the verses which they still found on the fragments, and\ncleverly supplied the remainder from their knowledge of. Manu and other Sm\n_ri_ tis, of the Mahabharata and the Pura _n_ as. This theory, I think,\nexplains all the difficulties which the present state of the section on secret\npenances raises. Perhaps it may be used also to account for some incongruities\nobservable in chapter XXX. The last two verses, XXX, 9-10, are common-places\nwhich are frequently quoted in the Mahabharata, the Hariva _m_ sa, the Pa _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ atantra, and modern anthologies. With their baldness of expression and\nsentiment they present a strong contrast to the preceding solemn passages from\nthe Veda, and look very much like an unlucky attempt at filling up a break at\nthe end of the MS. In connexion with this subject it ought, however, to be\nmentioned that this restoration of the last part of the Vasish _th_ a Dharma\n_s_ astra must have happened in early times, at least more than a thousand\nyears ago. For the oldest commentators and compilers of digests on law, such\nas Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ane _s_ vara 1, who lived at the end of the eleventh century A.\nD., quote passages from the section on secret penances as the genuine\nutterances of Vasish _th_ a. These details will suffice to show why I differ\nfrom Professor Jolly with respect to his conclusion from the agreement of the\nverses of Vasish _th_ a XXVIII, 10-15 with the Sutras of Vish _n_ u LVI.\n\nWith the exception of the quotations, the Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra\ncontains no data which could be used either to define its relative position in\nSanskrit literature or to connect it with the historical period of India. The\noccurrence of the word Romaka, XVIII, 4, in some MSS., as the name of a\ndegraded caste of mixed origin, proves nothing,, as other MSS. read Ramaka,\nand tribes called Rama and Rama _th_ a are mentioned in the Pura _n_ as. It\nwould be wrong to assert on such evidence that the Sutra belonged to the time\nwhen the Romans, or rather the Byzantines (Romaioi), had political relations\nwith India. Nor will it be advisable to adduce the fact that Vasish _th_ a\n\np. xxvi\n\n[paragraph continues] XVI, 10, 14, 15 mentions written documents as a. means\nof legal proof, in order to establish the 'comparatively late' date of the\nSutra. For though the other Dharma-sutras do not give any hint that the art of\nwriting was known or in common use in their times, still the state of society\nwhich they describe is so advanced that people could not have got on without\nwriting, and the proofs for the antiquity of the Indian alphabets are now much\nstronger than they were even a short time ago. The silence of \xc3\x82pastamba and\nthe other Sutrakaras regarding written documents is probably due to their\nstrict adherence to a general principle under-lying the composition of the\nDharma-sutras. Those points only fall primarily within the scope of the\nDharma-sutras which have some immediate, close connexion with the Dharma, the\nacquisition of spiritual merit. Hence it sufficed for them to give some\ngeneral maxims for the fulfilment of the gu _n_ adharma of kings, the\nimpartial administration of justice, and to give fuller rules regarding the\nhalf-religious ceremony of the swearing in and the examination of witnesses.\nJudicial technicalities, like the determination of the legal value of written\ndocuments, had less importance in their eyes, and were left either to the de\n_s_ a _k_ ara, the custom of the country, or to the Niti and Artha- _s_\nastras, the Institutes of Polity and of the Arts of common life. It would,\nalso, be easy to rebut attempts at assigning the Vasish _th_ a Dharma-sutra to\nwhat is usually 'a comparatively late period' by other pieces of so-called\ninternal evidence tending to show that it is an ancient work. Some of the\ndoctrines of the Sutra undoubtedly belong to an ancient order of ideas. This\nis particularly observable in the rules regarding the subsidiary sons, which\nplace the offspring even of illicit unions in the class of heirs and members\nof the family, while adopted sons are relegated to the division of members of\nthe family excluded from inheritance. The same remark applies to the exclusion\nof all females, with the exception of putrikas or appointed daughters, from\nthe succession to the property of males, to the permission to re-marry infant\nwidows, and to the law of the Niyoga or the appointment of adult\n\np. xxvii\n\nwidows, which Vasish _th_ a allows without hesitation, and even extends to the\nwives of emigrants. But as most of these opinions occur also in some of the\ndecidedly later metrical Sm _ri_ tis, and disputes on these subjects seem to\nhave existed among the various Brahmanical schools down to a late period, it\nwould be hazardous to use them as arguments for the antiquity of the Sutra.\n\nThe following points bear on the question where the original home of the Vedic\nschool, which produced the Dharma-sutra, was situated. First, the author\ndeclares India north of the Vindhyas, and especially those portions now\nincluded in the North-western Provinces, to be the country where holy men and\npure customs are to be found, I, 8-16. Secondly, he shows a predilection for\nthose redactions of the Veda and those Sutras which belong to the northern\nhalf of India, viz. for the Ka _th_ aka, the Va _g_ asaneyi- _s_ akha, and the\nSutras of Manu and Harita. Faint as these indications are, I think, they\npermit us to conclude that the Sutra belongs to a _K_ ara _n_ a settled in the\nnorth.\n\nAs regards the materials on which the subjoined translation is based, I have\nchiefly relied on the Benares edition of the text, with the commentary of K\n_ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita Dharmadhikari, and on a rough edition with the\nvarietas lectionum from the two MSS. of the Bombay Government Collection of\n1874-75 1, B. no. 29 and Bh. no. 30, a MS. of the Elphinstone College\nCollection of 1867-68, E. no. 23 of Class VI, and an imperfect apograph F. in\nmy own collection, which was made in 1864 at Bombay. The rough edition was\nprepared under my superintendence by Vamana _k_ arya _Gh_ alkikar, now teacher\nof Sanskrit in the Dekhan College, Pu _n_ a. When I wrote the translation, the\nBombay Government MSS. were not accessible to me. I could only use my own MS.\nand, thanks to the kindness of Dr. Rost, Colebrooke's MS., I. O. no. 913, from\nwhich the now worthless Calcutta editions have been derived either immediately\nor mediately. These materials belong to two groups. The Bombay MS. B., which\ncomes from Benares, closely agrees with K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita's text;\nand E., though\n\np. xxviii\n\npurchased at Pu _n_ a, does not differ much from the two. Bh., which comes\nfrom Bhuj in Ka _kh_ , and my own MS. F. form. a second group, towards which\nColebrooke's MS., I. O. no. 913, also leans. Ultimately both groups are\nderived from one codex archetypus.\n\nThe first group of MSS. gives a fuller and in general a correcter text than\nthe second. But it seems to me that the text of B., and still more K _ri_ sh\n_n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita's, has in many places been conjecturally restored, and\nthat the real difficulties have been rather veiled than solved. I have,\ntherefore, frequently preferred the readings offered by the second group, or\nbased on them my conjectural emendations, which have all been given in the\nnotes. To give a translation without having recourse to conjectural\nemendations was impossible, as a European philologist is unable to avail\nhimself of those wonderful tricks of interpretation which permit an Indian Pa\n_n_ _d_ it to extract some kind of meaning from the most desperate passages.\nIn a few cases, where even the best MSS. contain nothing but a conglomerate of\nmeaningless syllables or unconnected words, I have thought it advisable to\nrefrain from all attempts at a restoration of the text, and at a translation.\nA critical edition of the Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra is very desirable,\nand I trust that Dr. A. Fuhrer, of St. Xavier's College, Bombay, will soon\nsupply this want. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita's commentary, for which he had\nnot the aid of older v _ri_ ttis, shows considerable learning, and has been of\ngreat value to me. I have followed him mostly in the division of the Sutras,\nand have frequently given his opinions in the notes, both in cases where I-\nagree with him and in those where I differ from him, but think his opinion\nworthy of consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, I have to thank Professors R. von Roth, Weber, and Jolly, as\nwell as Dr. L. von Schroder, for the verification of a number of Vedic\nquotations, which they kindly undertook for me, as I was unable to use my own\nbooks of reference during the translation of the work.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xi:1](sbe1402.htm#fr_0) Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra II. 51.\n\n[xi:2](sbe1402.htm#fr_1) Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra XXIV, 5.\n\n[xi:3](sbe1402.htm#fr_2) Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra XXX, it.
