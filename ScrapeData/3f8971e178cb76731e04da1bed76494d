A Snataka should, when lying down to sleep, put his bamboo staff near (his\nbed) with (the formula), 'Strong one, protect' (l.l. 19). This will bring him\nluck.\n\n3\\. A place where he has a worm he should besprinkle with water, murmuring\n(the verses), 'Thy worm is killed' (MB. II, 7, 1-4).\n\n4\\. (If doing this) for his cattle, let him fetch in the afternoon an earth-\nclod taken out of a furrow, and let him in the morning strew the dust of it\n(on the place attacked by worms), murmuring (the same texts).\n\n5 5-23.

Having drunk more of it a fourth time silently he should give the\nremainder to a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n17\\. Over the cow, when it has been announced to him, he should recite (the\nformula), 'Let loose the cow.'\n\n18\\. Instead of 'and of N.N.' (in that formula) he should put the name of the\nperson who offers the Arghya reception.\n\n19\\. Thus if it is no sacrifice (by which the Arghya ceremony has been\noccasioned).\n\n20\\.
