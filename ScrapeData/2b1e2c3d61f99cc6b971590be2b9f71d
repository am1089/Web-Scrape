Having sacrificed, the teacher then asks him with regard to those deities\nto whom he has been given in charge (see above, chap. 3, 1), \'Hast thou\nfulfilled the duties of holiness before Agni, Indra, the Sun, and the Vi _s_\nve devas?\'\n\np. 80\n\n3\\. If he answers, \'I have fulfilled them, sir!\'\xc2\x97\n\n4\\. The teacher three times envelops, from the left to the right, with a fresh\ngarment the face (of the student) who is standing behind the fire, in front of\nthe teacher, with his face to the east.\n\n5 5. He turns the skirt (of that garment) upwards so that it cannot slip down,\n\n6 6. (And says) \'Leaving off for three days the putting on of fuel, the going\nfor alms, the sleeping on the ground, and the obedience to the teacher, fast\nin the forest, in a god\'s house or in a place where Agnihotra is performed,\nkeeping silence, with earnest care.\'\n\np. 81\n\n7\\. Here some (teachers) prescribe the same observances only for one night,\nduring which he is to stand.\n\n8 8. The teacher refrains from eating flesh and from sexual intercourse.\n\n9\\. When those three days or that night has elapsed, going out from the\nvillage he shall avoid to look at the following (persons or things) that form\nimpediments for the study (of the Veda):\n\n10 10. Raw flesh, a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala, a woman that has lately been confined,\nor that has her courses, blood, persons whose hands have been cut off,\ncemeteries, and all sorts of corpse-like (animals?) which enter (their dens?)\nwith the mouth first (?), keeping them away from the place where he dwells.\n\np. 82\n\n11\\. Going out (from the village) in a north-eastern direction the teacher\nsits down on a clean spot. turning his face to the east.\n\n12 12. When the sun has risen, he recites, in the way prescribed for the Veda-\nstudy, (the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka texts to the student) who is to keep silence and who\nwears a turban.\n\n13 13. This rule is to be observed only for the Mahanamni verses.\n\n14\\. At the sections however that follow (after the Mahanamnis) the other one\nhears while the teacher recites them for himself.\n\n15\\. He gives (to the teacher) the turban, a vessel, a good cow.\n\n16\\. (The teacher accepts the gifts) with the verses,\n\np. 83\n\n[paragraph continues] \'Thou him\' (Rig-veda I, 18, 5), and, \'High in the sky\'\n(Rig-veda X, 107, 2), or (he accepts them) all with the Pra _n_ ava (i.e. the\nsyllable Om).\n\n17\\.

The Indian tradition (with the\nexception only, as far as is known to me, of the _S_ ambavya commentary)\nrefers the ceremonies described in this chapter, like those treated of in\nchap. 11, as well to the _S_ ukriya as to the _S_ akvara and the other Vratas.\nThis is not correct. The eleventh chapter gives the rites common to the four\nVratas; the _S_ ukriya vrata is connected with no special ceremonies beside\nthose, so that the exposition of this Vrata is brought to an end in that\nchapter. The last Sutra of chap. 11 marks the transition to the special rites\nwhich are peculiar to the three other Vratas, and are connected with the\ncharacter of mystical secrecy attributed to the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, and thus it is\nwith the exclusion of the Sukriya that the twelfth chapter refers only to\nthose Vratas. The difference which we have pointed out between the two\nchapters finds its characteristic expression in Sutras 9 and 11 of chap. 11,\ncompared with chap. 12, 13. 14; in the former Sutras the statements there\ngiven are expressly extended to the Sukriya, the _S_ akvara, the Vratika, and\nthe Aupanishada, while in the latter passage mention is made first of the\nMahanamnis, i.e. the text corresponding to the _S_ akvara vrata, and then the\nuttara _n_ i prakara _n_ ani (the following sections) are referred to, i.e.\nthe Mahavrata and the Upanishad, so that the Sukriya vrata or the texts, the\nstudy of which is entered upon by that Vrata, are left out here.\n\nThere is a good deal of confusion in the several commentaries p. 79 with\nregard to the succession of the different ceremonies taught in this chapter.\nThey all agree in stating that after the lapse of the year through which the\nVrata is kept, a ceremony is performed called Uddiksha _n_ ika, i.e. the\ngiving up of the Diksha, or preparatory observance. This Uddiksha _n_ ika\nconsists chiefly in the teacher\'s ascertaining whether the student has\nfulfilled the duties involved by the Vrata (see Sutras 2 and 3). Besides that,\nthere is no doubt that a repetition of the Upanayana (chap. 11, 2) also formed\npart of the preparatory rites for the study of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. As to the way\nin which these different ceremonies and the other rites described in this\nchapter would have to be arranged according to our text, it is perhaps best to\nfollow the statements given in an epitome from the balavabodhanartham _Ri_\nshidaivata _kh_ andopaddhati (MS. Berol. Chambers, 199 a, fols. 13-16); the\nslight confusion therein is not difficult to get rid of. There we read, \'The\n_S_ akvara, however, is to be kept one year (chap. 11, 11). When the Uddiksha\n_n_ ika has been performed, and three nights (chap. 12, 6) or one day and one\nnight (ibid. 7) have elapsed, the Upanayana should be performed as above\n(chap. 11, 2), with this difference that at the end of the formula mama vrate,\n&c. (chap. 4, 1) one should say, "May B _ri_ haspati join thee to me for the\nholy observance of the _S_ akvara through one year, O Devadatta!" (On this\nformula, resting on a misunderstanding of chap. 4, Sutra 2, see the\nIntroduction, p. 8.) The rest is the same as at the _S_ ukriya. Then, when the\nyear (chap. 11, 11) has elapsed, and the Uddiksha _n_ ika has been performed,\nand the three days or the night have passed (chap. 12, 6. 7), he should go out\nof the village . . . and in the north-eastern direction,\' &c. (here follows\nthe description of how the secret doctrines should be taught to the student,\naccording to _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. VI). The confusion showing itself in the double mention\nof the Uddiksha _n_ ika, before and after the Upanayana, should no doubt be\nput to the account of the excerptor or perhaps even of the MS.; what the\nmeaning of the original Paddhati was is sufficiently shown in the remarks on\nthe following Vratas, for instance, on the Vratika (fol. 16), \'Now follows the\nVratika vrata. It lasts one year (chap. p. 80 11, 12). When the _S_ akvara has\nreached its end [here we find added at the margin of the MS.," After the\nUddiksha _n_ ika has been performed." These words ought not to be received\ninto the text; in the corresponding passage on the Aupanishada vrata they are\nnot found] he performs the whole ceremony, beginning from the smearing (of the\nStha _n_ _d_ ila with cow-dung), the drawing of the lines, &c., as at the\nUpanayana . . . and then, when one year has elapsed, he performs the Uddiksha\n_n_ ika, and the rules [given in chap. 12, 9 seq.] are observed as above.\' I\nthink that here the meaning of the text is correctly represented; first comes\nthe Upanayana, then follows the Vrata lasting one year, then the Uddiksha _n_\nika. After this ceremony the teacher gives to the student the directions\nmentioned in chap. 12, 16; then follow the three days, or the one night (chap.\n12, 6. 7), and finally they both go out of the village to the north-east, and\nin the forest they recite the Rahasya.\n\nOn the whole ceremonies connected with the study of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka the sixth\nbook should be compared.\n\n[80:5](sbe29042.htm#fr_178) Naraya _n_ a: Vastrasya da _s_ a _h_\nprantabhaga[m] uparish _t_ at k _ri_ tva tatha badhniyad yatha na sambhra _s_\nyeta adhastan na patati tatha vidheya _m_.\n\n[80:6](sbe29042.htm#fr_179) The things which the student here is ordered to\nleave off for three days are the same that are mentioned above, chap. 6, 8, as\nhis standing duties. According to Naraya _n_ a this would be the \xc3\x82de _s_ a\nmentioned in chap. II, 13.\n\n[81:8](sbe29042.htm#fr_180) Comp. chap. II, 6.\n\n[81:10](sbe29042.htm#fr_181) With Sutika is meant a woman during the first ten\ndays after her confinement, for which period the a _s_ au _k_ a\nlasts.\xc2\x97Apahasta is rendered by Naraya _n_ a by _kh_ innahasta; the comment on\nthe _S_ ambavya-G _ri_ hya mentions ayudha\xe1\xb9\x85kitahasta _m_ _s_ _k_ a. The\ntranslation of the last words of this Sutra (sarva _n_ i _k_ a _s_ avarupa _n_\ni yany asye na [or asyena?] pravi _s_ eyu _h_ svasya vasan nirasan) is\nabsolutely uncertain. Naraya _n_ a says that such animals as lions, serpents,\n&c. are designated in common use as _s_ avarupa _n_ i. (This literally means,\n\'having the form of a corpse.\' Immediately afterwards Naraya _n_ a gives a\nnearly identical explanation of _s_ avarupa as different from the one stated\nfirst. So perhaps we may conjecture that his first explanation rests on a\nreading sarparupa _n_ i; comp. the reading sarvarupa of Paraskara.) Of these\nthe animals entering their dwelling-places with the mouth first (asyena) are\nto be understood here as forming, when looked at, an impediment for the study.\nNaraya _n_ a then says that other authorities understand _s_ ava in the sense\nof a dead human body; then _s_ avarupa _n_ i are beings having the form\nthereof (tadrupa _n_ i), such as dogs, jackals, &c. The words yany asyena\npravi _s_ eyu _h_ signify that the study is impeded also on the sight of\nlions, tigers, &c.; for these enter their dwelling-places with their faces\nfirst (? anumukhai _h_ k _ri_ tva). The words svasya vasan nirasan mean, p. 82\naccording to Nar., \'when he\xc2\x97i.e. the teacher\xc2\x97goes out of his dwelling-place.\'\nRama _k_ andra says that _s_ avarupa either means lions, snakes, and other\ndangerous animals, or nails, horns, and other such things that fall off or are\nsevered from the body. The text of the _S_ ambavya MS. is sarva _n_ i _k_ a\n_s_ yamarupa _n_ i yavanya (?) pravi _s_ eyu _h_ , which the commentary\nexplains, sarva _m_ _s_ _k_ a bhakshyavarga _m_ _s_ _k_ a. I think there can\nbe little doubt that the text of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana is correct (except that some\ndoubt will remain as to asyena or asye na), the more so as the passage\nreoccurs, nearly identically, below at VI, 1, 4. 5. As to the translation we\ncan only go so far as to venture the opinion that the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana text does\nnot admit the interpretation given by _G_ ayarama, and accepted by Professor\nStenzler (who compares \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 27; Gautama XVI, 41) in Paraskara II,\n11, 3 for sarvarupa, which consequently should, in our opinion, be rejected\nalso in that passage of Paraskara. For ascertaining the true meaning of _s_\navarupa we shall have to wait until new parallel passages have been\ndiscovered.\n\n[82:12](sbe29042.htm#fr_182) The rules for the Anuva _k_ ana have been given\nabove in chap. 7.\n\n[82:13](sbe29042.htm#fr_183) The Mahanamni verses are given in the fourth \xc3\x82ra\n_n_ yaka of the Aitareyinas.
