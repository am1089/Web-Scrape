From (that) pure\n(principle) the Brahman 6 is produced; by (that) pure (principle) the Brahman\nis developed 7; that pure (principle), not illumined among all radiant\n(bodies), is (itself) luminous and illuminates (them) 8. That eternal divine\nbeing is perceived by devotees. The perfect is raised out of the perfect. It\n(being raised) out of the perfect is called the perfect. The perfect is\nwithdrawn from the perfect, and the perfect only remains 9. That eternal\ndivine being is perceived by devotees.\n\np. 187\n\n[paragraph continues] (From the Brahman), the waters 1 (are produced); and\nthen from the waters, the gross body. In the space within that 2, dwelt the\ntwo divine (principles). Both enveloping the quarters and sub-quarters,\nsupport earth and heaven 3. That eternal divine being is perceived by\ndevotees. The horse 4(-like senses) lead towards heaven him, who is possessed\nof knowledge and divine, (who is) free from old age, and who stands on the\nwheel of this chariot(-like body), which is transient, but the operations of\nwhich are imperishable 5. That eternal divine being 6 is perceived by\ndevotees. His form has no parallel 7; no one sees him with the eye 8. Those\nwho apprehend him by means, of the understanding, and also the mind and heart,\nbecome immortal 9. That eternal\n\np. 188\n\ndivine being is perceived by devotees. The currents of twelve collections 1,\nsupported by the Deity, regulate the honey 2; and those who follow after it\nmove about in (this) dangerous (world). That eternal divine being 3 is\nperceived by devotees. The bee 4 drinks that accumulated honey for half a\nmonth 5. The Lord created the oblation for all beings 6. That eternal divine\nbeing is perceived by devotees. Those who are devoid of wings 7, coming\n\np. 189\n\nto the A _s_ vattha of golden leaves 1, there become possessed of wings, and\nfly away happily 2. That eternal divine being 3 is perceived by devotees. The\nupward life-wind swallows up the downward life-wind; the moon swallows up the\nupward life-wind; the sun swallows up the moon 4; and another 5, swallows up\nthe sun. Moving about above the waters, the supreme self 6 does not raise one\nleg 7. (Should he raise) that, which is always performing sacrifices 8, there\nwill be no death, no immortality 9. That eternal divine being 10 is perceived\nby devotees.\n\np. 190\n\n[paragraph continues] The being which is the inner self, and which is of the\nsize of a thumb 1, is always migrating in consequence of the connexion with\nthe subtle body 2. The deluded ones do not perceive that praiseworthy lord,\nprimeval and radiant, and possessed of creative power 3. That eternal divine\nbeing is perceived by devotees. Leading mortals to destruction by their own\naction 4, they conceal themselves like serpents in secret recesses, 5. The\ndeluded men then become more deluded 6. The enjoyments afforded by them cause\ndelusion, and lead to worldly life 7. That eternal divine being 8 is perceived\nby devotees. This 9 seems to be common to all mankind--whether possessed of\nresources 10 or not possessed of resources--it is common to immortality and\nthe other 11. Those who are possessed (of them) 12 attain there to the source\nof the honey 13. That eternal divine being is perceived by devotees. They go,\n\np. 191\n\npervading both worlds by knowledge 1. Then the Agnihotra though not performed\nis (as good as) performed 2. Your (knowledge) of the Brahman, therefore, will\nnot lead you to littleness 3. Knowledge is (his) 4 name. To that the talented\nones attain. That eternal divine being is perceived by devotees. The self of\nthis description absorbing the material cause 5 becomes great. And the self of\nhim who understands that being is not degraded here 6. That eternal divine\nbeing is perceived by devotees. One should ever and always be doing good.\n(There is) no death, whence (can there be) immortality 7? The real and the\nunreal have both the same real (entity) as their basis. The source of the\nexistent and the non-existent is but one 8. That eternal divine being is\nperceived by devotees. The\n\np. 192\n\nbeing who is the inner self, and who is of the size of a thumb, is not seen,\nbeing placed in the heart 1. He is unborn, is moving about day and night,\nwithout sloth. Meditating on him, a wise man remains placid 2. That eternal\ndivine being is perceived by devotees. From him comes the wind 3; in him,\nlikewise, is (everything) dissolved. From him (come) the fire and the moon;\nand from him comes life 4. That is the support (of the universe); that is\nimmortal; that is all things perceptible 5; that is the Brahman, that glory.\nFrom that all entities were produced; and in that (they) are dissolved 6. That\neternal divine being is perceived by devotees. The brilliant (Brahman)\nsupports the two divine principles 7 and the universe, earth and heaven, and\nthe quarters. He from whom the rivers flow in (various) directions, from him\nwere created the great oceans 8. That eternal divine being is perceived by\ndevotees. Should one fly, even after furnishing oneself with thousands upon\nthousands of wings, and even though one should have the velocity of thought 9,\none would never reach the end of the (great) cause 10. That eternal divine\n\np. 193\n\nbeing is perceived by devotees. His form dwells in the unperceived 1; and\nthose whose understandings are very well refined 2 perceive him. The talented\nman who has got rid (of affection and aversion) perceives (him) by the mind.\nThose who understand him 3 become immortal. When one sees this self in all\nbeings stationed in various places 4, what should one grieve for after that 5?\nThe Brahma _n_ a has (as much interest) in all beings, as in a big reservoir\nof water, to which waters flow from all sides 6. I alone am your mother 7,\nfather,\n\np. 194\n\nand I too am the son. And I am the self of all this--that which exists and\nthat which does not exist 1. (I am) the aged grandfather of this, the father,\nand the son, O descendant of Bharata! You dwell in my self only 2. You are not\nmine, nor I (yours). The self only is my seat 3; the self too is (the source\nof) my birth 4. I am woven through and through 5 (everything). And my seat is\nfree from (the attacks of) old age 6. I am unborn, moving about day and night,\nwithout sloth. Knowing (me), verily, a wise man remains placid 7. Minuter than\nan atom 8, possessed of a good mind 9, I am stationed within all beings 10.\n(The wise) know the father of all beings to be placed in the lotus 11(-like\nheart of every one).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[186:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_899) Free from ignorance and other taints.

Gita, [p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112), note .\n\n[186:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_904) 'Named Hira _n_ yagarbha,' _S_ a _n_ kara. Cf.\nGita, [p. 107](sbe0816.htm#page_107); _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 354; Mu _nd_\naka, p. 309; Maitri, p. 130; Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_. p. 894.\n\n[186:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_905) 'In the form of Vira _g_ ,' says _S_ a _n_ kara.\nAs to these two, cf. Mu _nd_ aka, pp. 270-272; and _S_ a _n_ kara's and\n\xc3\x82nandagiri's notes there. See also _S_ veta _s_ vatara, pp. 324, 325; and N\n_ri_ si _m_ ha Tapini, pp. 233, 234; Colebrooke, Essays, pp. 344, 368 (Madras\nreprint). The Vira _g_ corresponds rather to the gross material world viewed\nas a whole; the Hira _n_ yagarbha to the subtle elements similarly viewed, an\nearlier stage in the development. Cf. the Vedantasara.\n\n[186:8](sbe0826.htm#fr_906) Cf. Mundaka, p. 303, and Gita, [p.\n112](sbe0817.htm#page_112).\n\n[186:9](sbe0826.htm#fr_907) The individual self is part of the supreme (Gita,\n[p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112)); perfect = not limited by space, time, &c.; as\nbeing part of a thing perfect in its essence, the individual soul also is\nperfect. The individual self is withdrawn from the perfect, viz. the whole\naggregate of body, senses, &c. presided over by the self, and when so\nwithdrawn it appears to be the pure self only. Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p.\n948.\n\n[187:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_908) 'The five elements,' says _S_ a _n_ kara, cf.\nAitareya, p. 189; and for 'gross body,' the original is literally 'water;' see\nsupra, p. 179, note 6; and see, too, \xc3\x8esopanishad, p. 11, and _S_ veta _s_\nvatara, p. 368, for different but kindred meanings.\n\n[187:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_909) Viz. the lotus-like heart. Cf. _Kh_ andogya,. p.\n528.\n\n[187:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_910) The two principles between them pervade the\nuniverse, the individual self being connected with the material world, the\nother with heaven; 'divine' is, literally, 'the brilliant,' says _S_ a _n_\nkara, who quotes Ka _th_ a, p. 305, as a parallel for the whole passage.\n\n[187:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_911) Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 111; Maitri, pp. 19-34; and\nMahabharata Stri Parvan, chap. VII, St. 13. Heaven = the Brahman here (see B\n_ri_ hadaranyaka, p. 876); divine = not vulgar, or unrefined- _S_ a _n_ kara,\nwho adds that though the senses generally lead one to sensuous objects, they\ndo not do so when under the guidance of true knowledge.\n\n[187:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_912) The body is perishable, but action done by the\nself while in the body leaves its effect.\n\n[187:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_913) To whom, namely, the man of knowledge goes, as\nbefore stated.\n\n[187:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_914) Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 347.\n\n[187:8](sbe0826.htm#fr_915) Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 152, and comment there, where\nthe eye is said to stand for all the senses.\n\n[187:9](sbe0826.htm#fr_916) Ka _th_ a, p. 149; _S_ veta _s_ vatara, pp.\n346-348, also p. 330 (should it be manisha there instead of manvi _s_ o ?).\nThe meanings of the three words are difficult to fix accurately. _S_ a _n_\nkara varies in his interpretations. p. 188 Probably the meaning he gives here\nis the best. Mind and understanding have been explained at Gita, [p.\n57](sbe0805.htm#page_57). The heart is the place within, where the self is\nsaid to be, and it may be taken as indicating the self, the meaning would then\nbe--a direct consciousness in the self of its unity with the Supreme. See,\ntoo, Taitt \xc3\x82ra _n_. p.896.\n\n[188:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_917) The five organs of action, the five senses of\nperception, the mind and understanding make the twelve.\n\n[188:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_918) Each current has its own honey regularly\ndistributed to it under the supervision of the Deity, the Supreme. Honey =\nmaterial enjoyment. Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 126, where _S_ a _n_ kara renders it by\nkarmaphala, 'fruit of action.'\n\n[188:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_919) Who supervises the distribution as stated. Cf.\nVedanta-sutra III, 2, 28-31.\n\n[188:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_920) Bhramara, which the commentators interpret to mean\n'one who is given to flying about--the individual self.'\n\n[188:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_921) I. e. in one life in respect of actions done in a\nprevious life.\n\n[188:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_922) _S_ a _n_ kara says this is in answer to a\npossible difficulty that action performed here cannot have its fruit in the\nnext world, as the fruit is so far removed in time from the action. The answer\nis, The Lord, the Supreme, can effect this, and taking his existence into\naccount there is no difficulty. Oblation = food, &c., _S_ a _n_ kara. The\nmeaning of the whole passage, which is not very clear, seems to be that the\nLord has arranged things so that each being receives some of this honey, this\nfood, which is the fruit of his own action. Then the question arises, Do these\nbeings always continue taking the honey and 'migrating,' or are they ever\nreleased? That is answered by the following sentence.\n\n[188:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_923) 'The wings of knowledge,' says _S_ a _n_ kara,\nciting a Brahma _n_ a text, those, verily, who have knowledge are possessed of\nwings, those who are not possessed of knowledge are devoid of wings.'\n\n[189:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_924) So, literally; _S_ a _n_ kara explains 'golden' to\nmean beneficial and pleasant,' by a somewhat fanciful derivation of the word\nhira _n_ ya. He refers to Gita, [p. 111](sbe0817.htm#page_111), about the\nleaves of the A _s_ vattha. Nilaka _nth_ a takes the leaves to be son, wife,\n&c., which are 'golden,' attractive at first sight. 'Coming to the A _s_\nvattha,' _S_ a _n_ kara says, means being born as a Brahma _n_ a,' &c. 'Flying\naway' = obtaining final emancipation.\n\n[189:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_925) The 'selfs' are compared to birds in the famous\npassage at Mu _nd_ aka, p. 306 (also _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 337). See also B\n_ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 499.\n\n[189:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_926) Knowledge of whom leads to 'flying away happily.'\n\n[189:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_927) Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 441. _S_ a _n_ kara says that\nthe author here explains the yoga by which the Supreme is to be attained. As\nto the life-winds, cf. Gita, [p. 61](sbe0806.htm#page_61). 'The moon,' says\n_S_ a _n_ kara, 'means the mind, and the sun the understanding, as they are\nthe respective deities of those organs' (cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, pp.\n521-542, and Aitareya, p. 187, where, however, the sun is said to appertain to\nthe eye).\n\n[189:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_928) I. e. the Brahman; the result is, one remains in\nthe condition of being identified with the Brahman.\n\n[189:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_929) Literally, flamingo. Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara, pp.\n332, 367; see also p. 289; Maitri, p. 99; and the commentary on _S_ veta _s_\nvatara, p. 283.\n\n[189:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_930) Viz. the individual self, _S_ a _n_ kara; that is,\nas it were, the bond of connexion between the Supreme and the world. Cf. Gita,\n[p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112).\n\n[189:8](sbe0826.htm#fr_931) This is the meaning, though the word in the\noriginal is _Ri_ tvi _g_ , which in the later literature only means priest.\n\n[189:9](sbe0826.htm#fr_932) As the whole of the material world is dissolved,\nwhen the self is dissevered from the delusion which is the cause of it.\n\n[189:10](sbe0826.htm#fr_933) Viz. who moves about on the waters, as above\nstated.\n\n[190:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_934) _S_ veta _s_ vatara, pp. 330-355; Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_.\np. 858, and comments there.\n\n[190:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_935) The life-winds, the ten organs or senses, mind,\nand understanding. See the same word similarly interpreted at _S_ veta _s_\nvatara, p. 306, and Sankhya-sutra III, 9.\n\n[190:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_936) According to _S_ a _n_ kara, he who makes the\ndistinct entities, after entering into them; he alludes apparently to _Kh_\nandogya, p. 407.\n\n[190:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_937) Namely, that of giving the poison of sensuous\nobjects.\n\n[190:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_938) I. e. the eye, ear, &c., like the holes of\nserpents.\n\n[190:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_939) I. e. can appreciate nought but those sensuous\nobjects.\n\n[190:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_940) One reading is, 'lead to danger' = which means 'to\nhell,' according to Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[190:8](sbe0826.htm#fr_941) Scil. delusion about whom leads to 'danger' or\n'worldly life.'\n\n[190:9](sbe0826.htm#fr_942) The quality of being one with the Brahman in\nessence.\n\n[190:10](sbe0826.htm#fr_943) Self-restraint, tranquillity, &c.\n\n[190:11](sbe0826.htm#fr_944) I. e. whether in the midst of worldly life, or in\nthe state of perfect emancipation.\n\n[190:12](sbe0826.htm#fr_945) Viz. the resources spoken of before.\n\n[190:13](sbe0826.htm#fr_946) Viz. the supreme Brahman. 'There' _S_ a _n_ kara\ntakes to mean 'in the supreme abode of Vish _n_ u.' See Introduction.\n\n[191:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_947) _S_ a _n_ kara does not explain this. Nilaka _nth_\na says pervading = fully understanding; both worlds = the self and the not-\nself. Is the meaning something like that of the passage last cited by _S_ a\n_n_ kara under Vedanta-sutra IV, 2, 14?\n\n[191:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_948) He obtains the fruit of it, _S_ a _n_ kara. See as\nto Agnihotra, _Kh_ andogya, p. 381 seq.; and Vedanta-sutra IV, 1, 16.\n\n[191:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_949) I. e. this mortal world, as action &c. would do.\n\n[191:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_950) I. e. of one who understands himself to be the\nBrahman. See Aitareya-upanishad, p. 246.\n\n[191:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_951) _S_ a _n_ kara says, 'the cause in which all is\nabsorbed.' Cf. a similar, but not identical, meaning given to Vai _s_ vanara\nat _Kh_ andogya, p. 264; and see Vedanta-sutra I, 2, 24. Becomes great =\nbecomes the Brahman, _S_ a _n_ kara.\n\n[191:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_952) Even in this body, _S_ a _n_ kara; degradation he\ntakes to mean departure from the body, citing Brihadaranyaka, p. 540.\n\n[191:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_953) There is no worldly life with birth and death for\none who does good, and thinks his self to be the Brahman; hence no\nemancipation from such life either.\n\n[191:8](sbe0826.htm#fr_954) The Brahman is the real, and on that the unreal\nmaterial world is imagined. Cf. Taittiriya, p. 97, and _S_ a _n_ kara's\ncomments there, which are of use in understanding this passage.\n\n[192:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_955) Cf. Ka _th_ a, pp. 130, 157; and B _ri_ hadara _n_\nyaka, p. 360.\n\n[192:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_956) Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 342; Ka _th_ a, pp.\n100, 107; Maitri, p. 134.\n\n[192:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_957) Cf. Taittiriya, p. 67; Ka _th_ a, p. 146; Mu _nd_\naka, p. 293.\n\n[192:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_958) Ka _th_ a, p. 298; Mu _nd_ aka, p. 288.\n\n[192:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_959) See [p. 180](sbe0825.htm#page_180), note .\n\n[192:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_960) See [p. 180](sbe0825.htm#page_180) supra.\n\n[192:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_961) 'The individual soul, and God,' say the\ncommentators, the latter being distinct from the supreme self. 'The universe,'\nsays Nilaka _nth_ a, 'means earth,' &c., by which I suppose he means earth,\nheaven, quarters, mentioned directly afterwards.\n\n[192:8](sbe0826.htm#fr_962) Ka _th_ a, p. 293.\n\n[192:9](sbe0826.htm#fr_963) This figure is implied in the \xc3\x8esopanishad, p. 10.\n\n[192:10](sbe0826.htm#fr_964) 'Therefore it is endless,' says _S_ a _n_ kara;\nand as to this, cf. Taittiriya, p. 51.\n\n[193:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_965) 'In a sphere beyond the reach of perception,' says\n_S_ a _n_ kara, who also quotes Ka _th_ a, p. 149, or _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p.\n347, where the same line also occurs.\n\n[193:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_966) The original for understandings is sattva, which\n_S_ a _n_ kara renders to mean anta _h_ kara _n_ a. 'Refined,' he says, 'by\nsacrifices and other sanctifying operations.' In the Ka _th_ a at p. 148\nsattva is rendered by _S_ a _n_ kara to mean buddhi--a common use of the word.\n\n[193:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_967) 'As being,' says _S_ a _n_ kara, 'identical with\nthemselves.' It will be noted that the form of expression is slightly altered\nhere. It is not 'those who understand this.'\n\n[193:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_968) I. e. in different aggregates of body, senses, &c.\nCf. Gita, pp. [104](sbe0815.htm#page_104) and [124](sbe0820.htm#page_124);\nalso _Kh_ andogya, pp. 475-551.\n\n[193:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_969) Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 882; _S_ a _n_\nkara, also refers to \xc3\x8e _s_ opanishad, p. 14.\n\n[193:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_970) The words are pretty nearly the same as at Gita,\n[p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48). _S_ a _n_ kara says, the Brahma _n_ a 'who has\ndone all he need do' has no interest whatever in any being, as he has none in\na big reservoir, and he cites Gita, [p. 54](sbe0805.htm#page_54), in support\nof this. One copy of _S_ a _n_ kara, however, differs from this; that runs\nthus: 'As a person who has done all he need do, has no interest in a big\nreservoir of water, so to a Brahma _n_ a who sees the self in all beings,\nthere is no interest in all the actions laid down in the Vedas, &c.; as he has\nobtained everything by mere perception of the self.' Nilaka _nth_ a's reading\nis exactly the same as at Gita, [p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48).\n\n[193:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_971) _S_ a _n_ kara says that Sanatsu _g_ ata states\nhere his own experiences, like Vamadeva, (about whom there is a reference at B\n_ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 216) and others, to corroborate what he has already\nsaid.
