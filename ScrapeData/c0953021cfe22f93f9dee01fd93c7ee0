We\nobserve the various modes of piety to be as it were contradictory. Some say\n(it 1 remains) after the body (is destroyed); some say that is not so. Some\n(say) everything 2 is doubtful; and others that there is no doubt. Some say\nthe permanent (principle) is impermanent, and others, too, that it exists, and\n(others) that it exists not 3. Some (say it is) of one form or twofold, and\nothers (that it is) mixed 4. Some Brahma _n_ as, too, who know the Brahman and\nperceive the truth, believe it to be one; others distinct; and others again\n(that it is) manifold 5. Some say both time and space (exist) 6, and others\nthat that is not so. Some have matted hair and skins; and some (are) clean-\nshaven and without covering. Some people are for bathing; some for the\nomission 7 of bathing. Some are for taking food; others are intent on fasting.\nSome people extol action, and\n\np. 376\n\nothers tranquillity. Some extol final emancipation; some various kinds of\nenjoyments; some wish for riches, and others indigence. Some (say) means 1\nshould be resorted to; others that that is not so. Some are devoted to\nharmlessness, and some given up to destruction; some are for merit and glory;\nand others say that is not so. Some are devoted to goodness; some are in the\nmidst of doubts; some are for pleasure, and some for pain 2. Some people (say)\nmeditation 3, other Brahma _n_ as (say) sacrifice, and others, gifts; but\nothers extol penance, and other persons sacred study; some knowledge, and\nrenunciation 4; and those who ponder on the element 5, nature 6. Some extol\neverything, and others nothing 7.\n\np. 377\n\n[paragraph continues] And, O best of the gods! piety being thus confused and\nabounding in contradictions, we are deluded, and come to no determination.\nPeople are acting, (saying) this is good, this is good. And he who is attached\nto a certain (form of) piety, always esteems that. Here (therefore) our\nunderstanding breaks down, and our mind is distracted. We wish, O best (of\nbeings)! to be informed of what is good. Be pleased now to proceed to state\nwhat is (so) mysterious, and what is the cause of the connexion between the\nKshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a and nature. Thus addressed by those Brahma _n_ as, the\nvenerable, holy, and talented creator of worlds told them accurately (what\nthey asked).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[375:1](sbe0861.htm#fr_1947) I. e. the piety, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra,; the self,\nNilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[375:2](sbe0861.htm#fr_1948) I. e. such as piety, &c., Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[375:3](sbe0861.htm#fr_1949) follow Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, who says \'permanent\'\nmeans soul, &c. The correct expression would seem to be \'that which is called\npermanent by others is impermanent.\'\n\n[375:4](sbe0861.htm#fr_1950) This is the view of those who hold the theory of\nPari _n_ ama, or development, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[375:5](sbe0861.htm#fr_1951) \'To be one\' = knowledge to be all of one\ndescription, \'distinct\' = knowledge having various entities for its distinct\nobjects (this is the view of the holders of the Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1anavada, says Ar _g_\nuna Mi _s_ ra); manifold = that the selfs are numberless. The words here are\nnearly identical with those at Gita, [p. 83](sbe0811.htm#page_83), see note\n[4](sbe0811.htm#fn_323) there.\n\n[375:6](sbe0861.htm#fr_1952) I. e. help in action, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[375:7](sbe0861.htm#fr_1953) See \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 1, 2 (comment).\n\n[376:1](sbe0861.htm#fr_1954) I. e. for the acquisition of anything desirable,\nAr _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, who adds, \'by those who wish for piety.\' Nilaka _nth_ a\nsays means = \'meditation and so forth;\' as to \'that is not so\' he cites what\nhe calls a _S_ ruti, which is however one of the Karikas of Gau _d_ apada on\nthe Ma _nd_ ukya; see p. 432.\n\n[376:2](sbe0861.htm#fr_1955) This, too, is not quite clear, but Nilaka _nth_ a\nsays, \'meditation should be practised for release from pain, and for\nacquisition of pleasure;\' land others say not so, it should be done without\ndesire.\'\n\n[376:3](sbe0861.htm#fr_1956) That is to say, they hold that meditation should\nbe practised.\n\n[376:4](sbe0861.htm#fr_1957) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra seems to take this to mean\n\'renunciation of knowledge,\' i.e. a blank, and says this was the view of the\nMadhyamikas,--I suppose the Madhyamika Bauddhas.\n\n[376:5](sbe0861.htm#fr_1958) I. e. the _K_ arvakas, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[376:6](sbe0861.htm#fr_1959) _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 276, and _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\ncommentary there.\n\n[376:7](sbe0861.htm#fr_1960) Were there optimists. and pessimists at the time\nof the Anugita in India? This verse, however, does not occur in some MSS.\nNilaka _nth_ a\'s note on this passage may be of some interest. He says, \'Some\nhold that the self exists after the body is lost; others, that is the\nLokayatas or _K_ arvakas, hold the contrary. Everything doubtful is the view\nof the Syadvadins; nothing doubtful that of the Tairthikas, the great teachers\n(I presume, about their own respective doctrines). Everything impermanent,\nTarkikas; permanent, Mima _m_ sakas; nothing exists, the _S_ unyavadins;\nsomething exists, but only momentarily, p. 377 Saugatas; knowledge is one, but\nthe ego and non-ego are two different principles, the Yoga _k_ aras; mixed, U\n_d_ ulomas; one, is the view of the worshippers of the Brahman as possessed of\nqualities; distinct, other Mima _m_ sakas, who hold that the special actions\nare the cause (of everything, is meant, I presume); manifold = the atomists;\ntime and space = astrologers. Those who "say that is not so," that is to say,\nthat what we see has no real existence at all, are the V _ri_ ddhas, ancient\nphilosophers; omission to bathe = the condition of Naish _th_ ika Brahma _k_\narins; bathing = householder\'s condition; "means should be resorted to, that\nis not so," those who are against all meditation, &c., according to the _S_\nruti text, which Nilaka _nth_ a quotes; "merit and glory, that is not so,"\nsome say there is no merit as the Lokayatas or _K_ arvakas; "knowledge,\nrenunciation," the former is to be gained only by means of the latter; "ponder\non elements" = who are intent on the investigation of the true nature of\nthings; nature = abundance of resources, by which alone knowledge is produced,\nnot by mere renunciation.\' It will be understood, that this commentary assumes\na different syntactical construction of the original in some places from that\nadopted in our translation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXV](sbe0862.htm)\n\n'
