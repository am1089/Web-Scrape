In the same ( _S_ akha also) it is thus (i.e. there is unity of vidya),\non account of the non-difference (of the object of meditation).\n\nIn the Agnirahasya forming part of the Va _g_ asaneyi- _s_ akha there is a\nvidya called the Sa _n_ _d_ ilya-vidya, in which we meet with the following\nstatement of particulars, 'Let him meditate on the Self which consists of\nmind, which has the pra _n_ a for its body and light for its form,' &c.--In\nthe B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka again, which belongs to the same _S_ akha, we read\n(V, 10,6), 'That person consisting of mind, whose being is light, is within\nthe heart, small like a grain of rice or barley. He is the ruler of all, the\nLord of all--he rules all this whatsoever exists.'--A doubt here presents\nitself whether these two passages are to be taken as one vidya in which the\nparticulars mentioned in either text are to be combined or not.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that we have to do with two separate vidyas whose\nparticulars cannot be combined. For\n\np. 215\n\notherwise, he argues, the text could not be cleared from the reproach of\nuseless repetition. As long as we have to do with texts belonging to different\n_S_ akhas we can rebut the charge of useless repetition by pointing to the\nfact that the texts are read and known by separate classes of men; we can then\nascertain the unity of the vidyas and combine the particulars mentioned in one\ntext only with those mentioned in the others; so e.g. in the colloquy of the\npra _n_ as. On the other hand, texts belonging to one and the same _S_ akha\ncannot be freed from the reproach of tautology as the same persons study and\nknow them, and passages occurring in different places cannot therefore be\ncombined into one vidya. Nor can we make out a separate position for each of\nthe texts of the latter kind by saying that it is the task of one text to\nenjoin the vidya and that of the other to enjoin the particulars of the vidya.\nFor in that case each of the two passages would mention only such particulars\nas are not mentioned in the other one; while as a matter of fact particulars\ncommon to both as well as not common to both are mentioned in each. Hence the\nparticulars of the one passage are not to be combined with those of the other.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. Just as passages met with in different\n_S_ akhas form one vidya in which the different particulars are to be\ncombined, so the two passages under discussion also, although belonging to one\nand the same _S_ akha, constitute one vidya only, since the object of\nmeditation is the same in both. For as such we recognise Brahman possessing\ncertain qualities such as consisting of mind and so on. Now we know that the\nobject constitutes the character of a meditation; as long as there is no\ndifference of character we cannot determine difference of vidya; and if there\nis no difference of vidya the particulars mentioned in different places cannot\nbe held apart.--But has it not been demonstrated above that the vidyas have to\nbe held apart, as otherwise tautology would arise?--Tautology does not result,\nwe reply, because the two passages may be understood to have each its\nparticular meaning, one of them enjoining the vidya, and the other the\nparticulars of the vidya.--But in that case the B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka ought\nto\n\np. 216\n\nmention only those points which are not mentioned in the Agnirahasya, as e.g.\n'he is the Lord of all;' while it ought not to mention what is already\nmentioned in the Agnirahasya, as e.g. the Selfs consisting of mind!--Not so,\nwe reply. Only the repetition, in one passage, of what is already mentioned in\nthe other passage enables us to recognise the vidya. The B _ri_ had-ara _n_\nyaka-passage, by mentioning some common qualities, first enables us to\nrecognise the Sa _n_ _d_ ilya-vidya, and then teaches certain particulars with\nreference to the latter; how otherwise should we know that the B _ri_.--\npassage is meant to enjoin particulars for the Sa _n_ _d_ ilya-vidya?\nMoreover, as in a passage which has a purpose of its own in so far as it\nteaches something not yet established, a reference to something already\nestablished is justified on the ground of its being a (so-called) nityanuvada,\nwe cannot overlook the recognition (of the identity of the passage with\nanother one) which is rendered possible through that anuvada. Hence, although\nthe two passages belong to one and the same _S_ akha, they yet constitute one\nvidya only, and their particulars have to be combined into one whole.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 20](sbe38163.htm)\n\n"
