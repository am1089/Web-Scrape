Now the gods, when going upwards, did not know (the way to) the\nheavenly world, but the horse knew it: when they go upwards with the horse, it\nis in order to know (the way to) the heavenly world. 'A cloth, an upper cloth,\nand gold,' this 1 is what they spread out for the horse 2:\n\np. 321\n\nthereon they quiet (slay) it, as (is done) for no other victim; and thus they\nseparate it from the other victims.\n\n13:2:8:22\\. When they quiet a victim they kill it. Whilst it is being quieted,\nhe (the Adhvaryu) offers (three) oblations 1, with (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 18), 'To\nthe breath hail! to the off-breathing hail! to the through-breathing hail!' he\nthereby lays the vital airs into it, and thus offering is made by him with\nthis victim as a living one 2.\n\n13:2:8:33\\. With, 'Amba! Ambika! Ambalika 3! there is no one to lead me,'--he\nleads up the (four)\n\np. 322\n\nwives 1: he thereby has called upon them (to come), and, indeed, also renders\nthem sacrificially pure.\n\n13:2:8:44\\. With (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 19), 'We call upon thee, the host-leader\nof (divine) hosts, O my true lord!' the wives walk round (the horse), and thus\nmake amends to it for that (slaughtering 2): even thereby they (already) make\namends to it; but,\n\np. 323\n\nindeed, they also fan 1 it. Thrice they walk round 2; for three (in number)\nare these worlds: by means of these worlds they fan it. Thrice again they walk\nround 3,--that amounts to six, for there are six seasons: by means of the\nseasons they fan it.\n\n13:2:8:55\\. But, indeed, the vital airs depart from those who perform the\nfanning at the sacrifice. Nine times they walk round 4; for there are nine\nvital airs: vital airs they thus put into their own selves, and the vital airs\ndo not depart from them. 'I will urge the seed-layer, urge thou the seed-\nlayer!' (the Mahishi says 5);--seed, doubtless, means offspring and cattle:\noffspring and cattle she thus secures for herself. [Va _g_. S. XXIII, 20,]\n'Let us stretch our feet,' thus in order to secure union. 'In heaven ye\nenvelop yourselves' (the Adhvaryu says),--for that is, indeed, heaven where\nthey immolate the victim: therefore he\n\np. 324\n\nspeaks thus.--'May the vigorous male, the layer of seed, lay seed!' she says\nin order to secure union.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[320:1](sbe44090.htm#fr_819) The 'iti' seems superfluous; Harisvamin explains\nit by 'etat trayam.' For a similar use of the particle, see [XIII, 2, 2,\n1](sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:1).\n\n[320:2](sbe44090.htm#fr_820) That is, they spread them on the ground for the\nhorse to lie upon. Differently St. Petersb. Dict., 'they spread over the\nhorse;' but see Katy. XX, 6, 10 comm.; and Harisvamin:--vaso yad\nantardhanayalam, adhivaso yad a _k_ _kh_ adanayalam, ta _k_ _k_ a vasasa upari\nstara _n_ iya _m_ , tayor upari hira _n_ ya _m_ nidheyam, tasmi _m_ s traye\nenam adhi upari sa _m_ _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ apayanti;--and he then remarks that these three\nobjects here do not take the place of the stalk of grass which, in the\nordinary animal sacrifice, is thrown on the place where the victim is to be\nkilled and cut up (III, 8, 1, 14; Katy. VI, 5, 15-16), but that the stalk is\nlikewise put down on this occasion. Similarly the comm. on Katyayana, where it\nis stated that the stalk of grass (or straw) is first laid down, and then the\nothers thereon. Indeed, as was the case in regard to the stalk of grass--\nrepresenting the barhis, or layer of sacrificial grass on the vedi--so here\nthe fourfold underlayer is intended to prevent any part of the sacrificial\nmaterial (havis)--the victim in this case--from being spilt. The p. 321 upper\ngarment (or cloth) must be sufficiently large to allow its being afterwards\nturned up so as to cover the horse and the queen consort.\n\n[321:1](sbe44090.htm#fr_821) Prior to these, however, he offers the two\n'Paripa _s_ avya,' i.e. 'oblations relating to the victim,'--or, perhaps,\n'oblations performed in connection with the carrying of fire round the\nvictim,' for this last ceremony is performed for all the victims (whereupon\nthe wild beasts placed between the stakes are let loose) before the killing of\nthe horse. See III, 8, 1, 6-16.\n\n[321:2](sbe44090.htm#fr_822) For the symbolic import of this, see III, 8, 2,\n4.\n\n[321:3](sbe44090.htm#fr_823) These are just three variants used in addressing\na mother (Mutter, Mutterchen, Mutterlein), or, indeed, as here, any woman\n(good lady! good woman!. Acc. to Katy. XX, 6, 12, this is the formula which\nthe assistant priest (the Nesh _t_ _ri_ , or, according to others, the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ , cf. Katy. VI, 5, 27-28) makes the king's wives say whilst\nleading them up to the slain horse to cleanse it. It is, moreover, to be\npreceded by the formula used, at this juncture, at the ordinary animal\nsacrifice, viz. 'Homage be to thee, O wide-stretched one, advance unresisted\nunto the rivers of ghee, along the paths of sacred truth! Ye divine, pure\nwaters, carry ye (the sacrifice) to the gods, well-prepared! may ye be well-\nprepared preparers!' (III, 8, 2, 2-3). The words 'Amba!' &c. are, according to\nMahidhara, addressed by the women to one another. The latter part of the\nformula as given in the Va _g_ . Sa _m_ h. (viz. 'the horse sleeps near\nSubhadrika, dwelling in Kampila') is apparently p. 322 rejected (? as\nantiquated, or inauspicious) by the author of the Brahma _n_ a. The ceremony\nof lying near the dead horse being looked upon as assuring fertility to a\nwoman, the formula used here is also doubtless meant to express an eagerness\non the part of the women to be led to the slaughtered horse, representing the\nlord of creatures, Pra _g_ apati. On this passage compare the remarks of\nProfessor Weber (Ind. Stud. I, p. 183), who takes the formula to be spoken by\nthe queen consort to her three fellow-wives; and who also translates the words\n'na ma nayati ka _s_ _k_ ana' (nobody leads me) by 'nobody shall lead me (by\nforce to the horse; but if I do not go) the (wicked) horse will lie near\n(another woman such as) the (wicked) Subadhra living in Kampila.'--\nHarisvamin's commentary on this passage is rather corrupt, but he seems at all\nevents to assume that each of the four wives apostrophizes the others with the\nabove formula (probably substituting their real names for the words 'amba,'\n&c.):--lepsam (? lipsa _m_ ) tavad esha patnivaktraka _h_ (? patnivakirata _h_\n) prapnoti, katham, ekaika hi patni itaras tisra amantrya _s_ esha _h_\nparidevayamana d _ri_ _s_ yate, he ambe he ambike he ambalike yuyam apu _n_ ya\nnishpadotv asya (?) samipa _m_ , sa _k_ a pakshapati kutsito\xe0\xa4\xbdsvako mayi\nyushmaka _m_ sasasti meva (!) subhadrika _m_ kampilavasinim ida (? iha) surupa\n_m_ na tu ma _m_ ka _s_ _k_ it tatra nayatiti; sasastity eva vartamanasamipye\nvartamanavad (Pa _n_. III, 3, 131) ity asannasevane drash _t_ avya _h_.--This\nbarbarous ceremony was evidently an old indigenous custom too firmly\nestablished in popular practice to be easily excluded from the sacrificial\nritual. That it had nothing to do with Vedic religion and was distasteful to\nthe author of the Brahma _n_ a is evident from the brief way in which he\nrefers to it, and from the far-fetched symbolic explanations attached to the\nformulas and discourses.\n\n[322:1](sbe44090.htm#fr_824) Viz. from their ordinary place near the\nGarhapatya he leads them whilst holding jars of water in their hands.\n\n[322:2](sbe44090.htm#fr_825) Apahnuvate vismaranty evasmai etat pradakshi _n_\navartanena sa _m_ _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ apanam unnayanti, comm.\n\n[323:1](sbe44090.htm#fr_826) Thus Harisvamin:--dhuvate dhunane(na) upava _g_\nayanti, evam a _s_ va _m_ ra _g_ anam iva vya _g_ anair etat,--'they shake\nthemselves,' St. Petersb. Dict.; and, indeed, it is doubtless by the flutter\nof the garments produced in walking round first one way and then another, that\nthe fanning is supposed to be produced.\n\n[323:2](sbe44090.htm#fr_827) Viz. in sunwise fashion (pradakshi _n_ a), that\nis so as to keep the object circumambulated on one's right side.\n\n[323:3](sbe44090.htm#fr_828) Viz. in the opposite, the 'apradakshi _n_ a _m_ '\nway, as is done in the sacrifice to the departed ancestors. They do so with\nthe text, 'We call upon thee, the dear Lord of the dear ones, O my true lord!'\n\n[323:4](sbe44090.htm#fr_829) Viz. another three times in the sunwise way.\nHaving completed their circumambulation, the king's wives cleanse the horse's\napertures of the vital airs (mouth, nostrils, eyes, &c.), as the Sacrificer's\nwife did at the ordinary animal sacrifice (III, 8, 2, 4), which they do with\nthe text, 'We call upon thee, the treasure-lord of treasures, O my true lord!'\n\n[323:5](sbe44090.htm#fr_830) Cf. III, 5, 2, 1 seqq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 2, 9. Ninth Brahma _n_ a](sbe44091.htm)\n\n"
