Agni, at the rising of the dawn [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:1:1) bring\nsplendid wealth, immortal _G_ atavedas, to the worshipper, (and bring hither)\nto-day the gods awakening with the dawn.\n\n2\\. For thou art the accepted messenger, the bearer of sacrificial food, O\nAgni, the charioteer of worship. United with the two A _s_ vins and with the\nDawn bestow on us abundance of valiant heroes, and high glory.\n\n\n\n3\\. We choose to-day as our messenger Agni, the Vasu, the beloved of many,\nwhose banner is smoke, whose \xe2\x80\xa6  [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:3:1) is light, at the\ndawning of the day, the beautifier of sacrifices\n[2](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:3:2).\n\n4\\. I magnify at the dawning of the day Agni _G_ atavedas, the best, the\nyoungest guest, the best receiver of offerings, welcome to pious people, that\nhe may go to the gods [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:4:1).\n\n\n\n5\\. I shall praise thee, O food on which everything lives, immortal one\n[1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:5:1), Agni, the immortal protector, O holy god, the\nbest sacrificer, O bearer of sacrificial food.\n\n6\\. Be kind-spoken to him who praises thee, O youngest god, honey-tongued, the\nbest receiver of offerings. Lengthening Praska _n_ va's life, that he may\nreach old age, do homage [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:6:1) to the host of the\ngods.\n\n\n\n7\\. The clans kindle thee, the all-possessing Hot _ri_ :\n\np. 38\n\ntherefore conduct hither speedily, much-invoked Agni, the provident gods--\n\n8\\. Savit _ri_ , the Dawn, the two A _s_ vins, Bhaga, Agni\n[1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:8:1), at the dawning (of the day), (at the end) of\nnight [2](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:8:2). The Ka _n_ vas, having pressed Soma,\ninflame thee, the bearer of sacrificial food, O best performer of worship.\n\n\n\n9\\. As thou, O Agni, art the lord of worship, the messenger of the clans,\nconduct hither to-day the gods awakening with the dawn, of sun-like aspect,\nthat they may drink Soma.\n\n10\\. Agni, rich in splendour! thou hast shone after the former dawns, visible\nto all. Thou art the guardian in the hamlets, the Purohita; thou be-longest to\nmen at the sacrifices [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:10:1).\n\n\n\n11\\. O Agni, let us put thee down (on the altar) as Manus did, O god, to be\nthe performer of the sacrifice, the Hot _ri_ , the wise priest, the quick\nimmortal messenger.\n\n12\\. When thou, the Purohita of the gods, who art great like Mitra, goest on\nthy errand as messenger in their midst, then the flames of Agni shine like the\nroaring waves of the Sindhu [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:12:1).\n\n\n\n13\\. Agni with thy attentive ears, hear me, together with the gods driven (on\ntheir chariots) [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:13:1) who accompany thee. May Mitra\nand Aryaman sit down on the sacrificial grass, they who come to the ceremony\nearly in the morning.\n\n14\\. May the Maruts, they who give rain, the fire-tongued increasers of _Ri_\nta, hear my praise. May Varu _n_ a, whose laws are firm, drink the Soma,\nunited with the two A _s_ vins and with the Dawn!\n\np. 39\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe hymn is ascribed to Praska _n_ va Ka _n_ va, who is the reputed author of\nthe whole group of the hymns, I, 44-50\\. It is certain that these hymns really\nbelong to a branch of the great Ka _n_ va family, for which the name Praska\n_n_ va is characteristic. Comp. my Prolegomena, p. 260.\n\nThe metre is Barhata Pragatha. Verse 1 = SV. I, 40. Verses 1-2 = SV. II,\n1130-1131\\. Verse 11 = TB. II, 7, 12, 6. Verse 13 = SV. I, 50; VS. 33, 15; TB.\nII, 7, 12, 5.\n\nThis Agni-hymn contains a number of allusions which show that it was destined\nfor the morning service. The same may be said of the next hymn, I, 45, and of\nthe whole collection of Praska _n_ va hymns, which are addressed exclusively\nto the deva _h_ prataryava _n_ a _h_ , viz. Agni in his special character as a\nmatutinal deity, the two A _s_ vins, the Dawn, the rising Sun. From the\nmention of the Soma tiroahnya 45, 10; 47, 1, and from other circumstances,\nBergaigne has very ingeniously drawn the conclusion that in the Praska _n_ va\ncollection an ancient \xc3\x82 _s_ vina _s_ astra is preserved; see Recherches sur\nl'histoire de la Liturgie Vedique, 45.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. I believe that the text, I may perhaps not say requires, but very\nstrongly invites, a slight correction. The tradition gives agne vivasvat\nushasa _h_ _k_ itram ra\xc2\xb4dha _h_ amartya. To connect vivasvat with ra\xc2\xb4dha _h_\nand to make the genitive ushasa _h_ depend on ra\xc2\xb4dha _h_ would give an\nexpression which is not, strictly speaking, impossible but in every case very\nunusual. Nothing, on the other hand, is more frequent than combinations of the\nlocative of a noun derived from vi-vas with the genitive ushasa _h_ , 'at the\nrising of the dawn' (ushasa _h_ vy\xcc\x83ush _t_ au, vy\xcc\x83ush _t_ ishu, vyushi; comp.\nthe phrase vasto usra\xc2\xb4 _h_ treated of by Kaegi, Festgruss an Bohtlingk, 48;\nvasto _h_ usra\xc2\xb4 _h_ , Bartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XV, 185). I think\nthat such\n\np. 40\n\na phrase should be restored in our verse, and propose to read agne vivasvan\nushasa _h_ , &c. The word vivasvan occurs in VIII, 102, 22. agnim idhe\nvivasvabhi _h_. The expression used here would thus be similar to that of III,\n15, 2. tvam na _h_ asya\xc2\xb4 _h_ ushasa _h_ vy\xcc\x83ush _t_ au \xe2\x80\xa6 bodhi gopa\xc2\xb4 _h_ ;\ncomp. IV, 1, 5, &c.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The meaning of bha\xc2\xb4 _h_ - _ri_ _g_ ika is quite uncertain. The accent\nwould well agree with the explanation of the word as a possessive compound;\ndhumaketum bha\xc2\xb4 _h_ - _ri_ _g_ ikam would then be exactly parallel: whose\nbanner is smoke, whose _ri_ _g_ ika is light. We have then go- _ri_ _g_ ika as\nan epithet of Soma, 'he whose _ri_ _g_ ika the cows are,' i. e. 'whose _ri_\n_g_ ika is milk,' and avi _h_ - _ri_ _g_ ika as an epithet of Dadhikravan ('he\nwhose _ri_ _g_ ika is visible'). All this taken together is clearly\ninsufficient for giving a result, and there is scarcely a better prospect for\netymological guesses. Bergaigne's (Rel. Ved., I, 206) translation of _ri_ _g_\nika by 'fleche' would do for bha\xc2\xb4 _h_ - _ri_ _g_ ika, but it is not very\ntempting in the cases of go- _ri_ _g_ ika and avi _h_ - _ri_ _g_ ika. Roth\n(Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Ges. 48, 118) translates 'lichtglanzend.'\n\nNote 2. Pischel's explanation of adhvara _s_ ri (Vedische Studien, I, 53, 'Zum\nOpfer kommend') does not seem convincing to me.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Ludwig's translation 'dasz er die gotter herbringe' is not exact. As\nto the real meaning of our passage, comp. VII, 9, 5. agne yahi duty\xcc\x83am \xe2\x80\xa6\ndeva\xc2\xb4n a _k_ _kh_ a, 'Agni, go as a messenger \xe2\x80\xa6 to the gods.'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Boehtlingk-Roth propose to read am _ri_ tabho _g_ ana. I think the\ntraditional text is right. Agni is called vi _s_ vasya bho _g_ ana similarly,\nas it is said in I, 48, 10 (with regard to Ushas), vi _s_ vasya hi pra\xc2\xb4 _n_\nanam _g_ i\xc2\xb4vanam tve. Am _ri_ ta may be vocative s. neuter or masculine. Comp.\nLanman, 339.\n\np. 41\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Benfey (Quantitatsverschiedenheiten, IV, 2, 27) and Ludwig take\nnamasya\xc2\xb4 for a first person.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. If the accusative agnim is right, as it probably is, Agni would be\ninvoked to conduct Agni to the sacrifice. This is quite a possible idea. Comp.\nthe formula of the 'devatanam avahanam,' 'agnim agna avaha, somam avaha; agnim\navaha,' i. e. Agni, conduct hither Agni, conduct hither Soma, conduct hither\nAgni.' See Hillebrandt, Das Altindische Neu- und Vollmondsopfer, p. 84.\n\nNote 2. Lanman, 482, takes kshapa _h_ as an acc. plur. I think it is gen.\nsing., and the accent should be kshapa _h_. Comp. VIII, 19, 31; III, 49, 4,\nand the phrase akto _h_ vy\xcc\x83ush _t_ au.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Prof. Max Muller translates: 'Thou art the guardian in the hamlets,\nthe chief-priest; thou art the human chief-priest at the sacrifices.'\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. With the third Pada comp. IX, 50, 1, where it is said that the mighty\nstrength of Soma shows itself 'sindho _h_ urme _h_ iva svana _h_ ,' i. e.\n'like the roar of the waves of the Sindhu.'\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. I cannot follow the translation of Dr. Neisser, Bezzenberger's\nBeitrage, XVIII, 316.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 45](sbe46011.htm)\n\n"
