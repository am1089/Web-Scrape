But it\nrepresents the contents and spirit of the fourth Veda in a far greater measure\nthan is indicated by this numerical statement. The twentieth book of the\nSamhita, with the exception of the so-called kuntapasuktini (hymns 127-136),\nseems to be a verbatim repetition of mantras contained in the Rig-veda, being\nemployed in the Vaitana-sura at the sastras and stotras of the soma-sacrifice:\nit is altogether foreign to the spirit of the original Atharvan. The\nnineteenth book is a late addendum, in general very corrupt; its omission\n(with the exception of hymns 26, 34, 35, 38, 39, 53, and 54) does not detract\nmuch from the general impression left by the body of the collection. The\nseventeenth book consists of a single hymn of inferior interest. Again, books\nXV and XVI, the former entirely Brahmanical prose, the latter almost entirely\nso, are of doubtful quality and chronology. Finally, books XIV and XVIII\ncontain respectively the wedding and funeral stanzas of the Atharvan, and are\nlargely coincident with corresponding Mantras of the tenth book of the Rig-\nveda: they are, granted their intrinsic interest, not specifically Atharvanic.\nOf the rest of the Atharvan (books I-XIII) there is presented here about one\nhalf, naturally that half which seemed to the translator the most interesting\nand characteristic. Since not a little of the collection rises scarcely above\nthe level of mere verbiage, the process of exclusion has not called for any\ngreat degree of abstemiousness.\n\nThese successive acts of exclusion have made it possible to present a fairly\ncomplete history of each of the hymns translated. The employment of the hymns\nin the Atharvanic practices is in closer touch with the original purpose of\nthe composition or compilation of the hymns than is true in the case of the\nother collections of Vedic hymns. Many times, though by no means at all times,\nthe practices connected with a given hymn present the key to the correct\ninterpretation of the hymn itself. In any case it is instructive to see what\nthe Atharvan priests did with the hymns of their own school, even if we must\njudge their performances to be secondary.\n\nI do not consider any translation of the AV. at this time as final. The most\ndifficult problem, hardly as yet ripe for final solution, is the original\nfunction of many mantras, after they have been stripped of certain adaptive\nmodifications, imparted to them to meet the immediate purpose of the\nAtharvavedin. Not infrequently a stanza has to be rendered in some measure of\nharmony with its connection, when, in fact, a more original meaning, not at\nall applicable to its present environment, is but scantily covered up by the\nsecondary modifications of the text. This garbled tradition of the ancient\ntexts partakes of the character of popular etymology in the course of the\ntransmission of wofds. New meaning is read into the mantras, and any little\nstubbornness on their part is met with modifications of their wording. The\ncritic encounters here a very difficult situation: searching investigation of\nthe remaining Vedic collections is necessary before a bridge can be built from\nthe more original meaning to the meaning implied and required by the situation\nin a given Atharvan hymn. Needless to say the only correct and useful way to\ntranslate a mantra in the Atharvan, is to reproduce it with the bent which it\nhas received in the Atharvan. The other Vedic collections are by no means free\nfrom the same taint. The entire Vedic tradition, the Rig-veda not excepted,\npresents rather the conclusion than the beginning of a long period of literary\nactivity. Conventionality of subject-matter, style, form (metre), &c., betray\nthemselves at every step: the 'earliest' books of the RV. are not exempt from\nthe same processes of secondary grouping and adaptation of their mantras,\nthough these are less frequent and less obvious than is the case in the\nAtharva-veda.\n\nObligations to previous translators: Weber, Muir, Ludwig, Zimmer, Grill',\nHenry, &c., are acknowledged in the introduction to each hymn. I regret that\nthe work was in the hands of the printer prior to the appearance of Professor\nHenry's excellent version of books X-XII. The late lamented Professor Whitney\nkindly furnished me with the advance sheets of the late Shankar Pandurang\nPandit's scholarly edition of the AV. with Sayana's commentary, as also with\nmany of the readings of the Cashmir text (the so-called Paippalada-sakha) of\nthe AV. Neither the Paippalada nor Sayana sensibly relieves the task of its\ndifficulty and responsibility.\n\nMAURICE BLOOMFIELD.\n\nBALTIMORE: April, 1896.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 22.
