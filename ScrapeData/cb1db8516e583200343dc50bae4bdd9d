From the highest Himalayas on the north down to\nRameswar in the south and from Chandranath hill on the east to Dwarka on the\nwest the whole of India is filled up with Siva-temples here and there. So it\nis quite needless to give any acquaintance of God Siva to the Indians whom\nthey are ever-familiar with. Their ins and outs are ever-filled up with the\nattributes of Siva and hearts ever spring with joy in His very worship! This\nSiva-worship is not only an object of outward form of Hindu-worship, but the\nGreatest Saint Acharya Sankara who perfectly realised within himself the true\nmeaning of Indian worship of God Siva, declared quite clearly in one of the\nhymns called "Nirvana Shatkam" as follows:--"I am beyond all imaginations and\nforms, I do not obey any sense but all senses obey Me; there is nothing\nwithout Me, I am Siva Himself in the very Shape of Soul and Joy. This is the\nreal description of Siva, the worshippers who proceed in their way with this\ntrue acquaintance of the worshipped\n\np. 138\n\nare surely blessed. His worship required no particular arrangement,--He is\never satisfied with two little prayers and offerings,--a drop of water, a leaf\nof bel and cheek-slap sounds only please Him the most. We have no second thing\nto offer to Him, the Atman or Soul is the only object of His offer. In His\nwell-known hymn of salutation we find the following expression:--\'We bow Thee\ndown O God, full of infinite [welfare](errata.htm#36) and calmness and the\nroot cause of all the three worlds. I offer my soul unto Thee. Thou God of\ngods and Goal of all." Surrendering of the Self is His only mode of worship,\nwhich transform an earthly being to Divine being full of heavenly bliss. Hence\na blessed holy person sing most loudly the highly esteemed song "Am Siva\nHimself am Siva Himself in the very shape of Soul and Joy!"\n\n#### TRUE SIGNIFICANCE\n\nSiva worship does not require the exact image of Siva as depicted in the hymn\nof Holy Scripture, but it prefers a bright symbol of Divinity widely known as\n"Siva-Lingam"!\n\np. 139\n\n[paragraph continues] What is Lingam? We must think deeply and make out its\nreal explanation. Lingam means sign or symbol. Worship of Such Divine Symbol\nis a current usage amongst all nations of the world. The Hindus worship\nLingam, the Bouddhas, Stupa, the Mahomedans, a Blue Stone Pulpit in Kaba and\nthe Christians a Cross Staff; thus almost every great nation worships a Divine\nsymbol of whatever shape it may be. The modern historians are of opinion that\nthe Buddhistic Stupa or Pagoda was transformed into Siva Lingam by mighty\ninfluence of Acharya Sankara. But actually the worship of Siva Lingam is being\npractised by the Hindus from unknown pre-historic time. We find the origin of\nits history in the last chapter of \'Dharma Samhita\' of \'Siva Maha Puranam\'\nthat when the world was totally destroyed and there was nothing but unending\nflood of water and three original representations of Godhood namely Brahma,\nVishnu and Rudra, Brahma and Vishnu requested Rudra most fervently for\nrecreation of the universe. Rudra gladly consented and immersed Himself in a\nlong deep meditation. Some thousand years being passed in this way and\n\np. 140\n\nfinding no possibility of creation by Him, Vishnu asked Brahma to perform the\ntask, who finished it instantly. Rudra then rose from the meditation and\nfinding everything already created by Brahma, because fired with wrath and at\nonce attempted to destroy. At this Brahma and Vishnu came before Him and\nextinguished His wrath by entreaties, and singing long prayer ire His praise.\nEasily pleased He was gladdened instantly with that and with the request of\nBrahma and others, He threw off His fiery vigour produced through wrath unto\nthe Sun, who got the splendid illumination to light up the world. The Divine\nVigour of God Siva, placed thus in the Sun is worshipped thrice a day by all\nas Gavatri, Savitri and Saraswati. Thereafter Siva who secured endless life\nseeds for the creation through long meditation, put off the Lingam or Symbol\nwhich is the stock of life-seeds and threw it down on the earth. Thus being\nthrown off it began to expand both downward and upward and made unbearable\nhorror to the world. Vishnu went downward and Brahma upward to get two ends of\nthe same but being utterly unsuccessful were staying quite unhappy. At this\n\np. 141\n\nmoment some words were heard to be uttered in the [Ethereal](errata.htm#37)\nplane that "If this blazing Symbol of Divine vigour be worshipped by all it\nwould be pleased and the horrible temper would be transformed into broad\ncalmness to the entire welfare of the world. By worshipping the Symbol all\nwould worship God Siva. Thereupon all did the same whole-heartedly and\nhappiness of the world was restored for ever and the worshippers were filled\nup with the spirit of Divinity and fully realised within themselves the\nperfect Godhood of Siva.\n\n#### THREE DIVINE FORMS\n\nFrom the very time of this well-known fact about the origin of Effulgent and\nEternal Lingam or Symbol, the Hindus have been worshipping God Siva in Pure\nand Divine Symbol. Siva is not only the lord of destruction, a description in\nthe \'Sivastakam\' composed by Acharya Sankara gives out the perfectness of God\nSiva in three Divine forms for three divisions of work, namely Brahma as\nCreator, Vishnu as Supporter and Rudra as Destroyer. His symbol is ever-\nembraced by the Symbol of Nature, the World Mother. Here lies a very high idea\nof Hindu system of worship which express\n\np. 142\n\nas clear as daylight the true meaning of worshipping Fatherhood and Motherhood\nof God symbolized together. Everyone being the child of Father God and Mother\nNature possesses full right to worship what symbolize Them both. Is it not?\nYes, actually this is the universal system of worship not at all confined in\nany country, community or sect. This is quite natural just as a child pays its\ndue respect to the father and mother.\n\nIn other words it is the worship of Self or Atman and the realization of\nGodhood within the worshipper himself. The spinal column standing on the\nplexus which is triangular in form is the symbol of that worship. From the\nplexus right up comes the hollow canal called Susumna or Antarasunya and from\nthe left and the right sides come two fine nerves known as Ida and Pingala\ncoiled round this hollow canal or the spinal column forming vertebra. These\nare the upper end or terminus of the hollow canal wherein to be found a mesh\nwork of fine nerve tissues which is on the central part of the brain,\notherwise called cerebellum apart from cerebrum and medulla oblongata. In\nmythological language this mesh or network of tissues is called the\n\np. 143\n\nthousand [petalled](errata.htm#38) lotus or Sahasrar.\n\nThis is what we find in physiological structures. Inside the hollow canal\nknown as Susumna three concentric nerve tissues equally hollow inside are also\nmentioned in the book. The first or the outer one is called Vazra-naree or\nIndra-naree. The second one inside the first casing is called Surya-naree or\nSolar canal and still further inside another hollow canal mentioned is known\nas Brahmanaree or the hollow canal for Divinity.\n\n#### SYMBOLIC DRIFT\n\nThis whole physiological representation is symbolized in stone image known as\nSthanu and Gauripatta. The worshipper is to unloosen a bit of clog or small\nglobule on the top of the Sthanu and then the worship will begin, because it\nis supposed that the internal passage to the higher plane is naturally blocked\nup which must be removed, so that the internal flow or the passage of energy\nmight come up to the highest plane known as Sahasrar. To put in Psychological\nlanguage the Atman or the Ego which is supposed to be inside the hollow canal\nor Susumna of the person is to be worshipped or meditated upon. From\n\np. 144\n\nthe down plexus six stages are mentioned as lotuses. These lotuses and stages\nare to be traversed by rigid meditation upon one\'s own Self and the adjoining\nnerve tissues of the centre are called particular lotuses. We have Muludhara,\nSwadhisthana, Manipura; Bisuddha Chakra, Anahata, Ajna Chakra and Sahasrar.\nThus worshipping these representations one is worshipping his Ownself or Ego.\nHence no rigid ritualities are ordained neither any caste distinction nor\nspeciality of persons are required. Every person can worship Siva quite\nindependently. It is the most non-sectarian, non-bigoted form of worship. This\nworship is the worthy self projection or super-imposition of one\'s own Self or\nAdhyas of the Atman as symbolized in some material casing or stone\nrepresentation.\n\nNow in the Bamachari period when everything was explained out through the\nsymbol of creative agencies known as Brahma-Vija and Sristhi Vija, the\nvertebra or the Sthanu is called the male symbol or Phallus of creation and\nthe plexus or Gouripatta is called the female symbol or Phallus of production.\nThus the creative aspect of the original idea is well-preserved in the\n\np. 145\n\nrepresentation which form an alter mode of explanation. The Sthanu is the\nrepresentation of the Eternal column or Image known as Jyotirmoy or Effulgent\nImage and the Gouripatta is represented receptivity of the Divine Energy which\nbrings forth the creation. In Common parlance it is called Firmament and Earth\nor Creative Father and Mother in procreation.\n\nMarch 2, 1930.\n\nFrom The A. B. Patrika\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Rev.
