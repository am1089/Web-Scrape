Sugriva raised a cry  \nThat shook and rent the echoing sky,  \nA shout so fierce and loud and dread  \nThat stately bulls in terror fled,  \nLike dames who fly from threatened stain  \nIn some ignoble monarch's reign.  \nThe deer in wild confusion ran  \nLike horses turned in battle's van.  \nDown fell the birds, like Gods who fall  \nWhen merits fail, [1](ry289.htm#fn_579), at that dread call.  \nSo fiercely, boldened for the fray,  \nThe offspring of the Lord of Day  \nSent forth his furious shout as loud  \nAs thunder from a labouring cloud,  \nOr, where the gale blows fresh and free,  \nThe roaring of the troubled sea.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[340:1](ry287.htm#fr_578) Called respectively Garhapatra, \xc3\x81havaniya, and\nDakshina, household, sacrificial, and southern.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XV.: Tara.](ry289.htm)\n\n"
