Prayer to Kala (time), personified as a primordial power.\n\n1\\. Time, the steed, runs with seven reins (rays), thousand-eyed, ageless,\nrich in seed. The seers, thinking holy thoughts, mount him, all the beings\n(worlds) are his wheels.  \n2\\. With seven wheels does this Time ride, seven naves has he, immortality is\nhis axle. He carries hither all these beings (worlds). Time, the first god,\nnow hastens onward.  \n3\\. A full jar has been placed upon Time; him, verily, we see existing in many\nforms. He carries away all these beings (worlds); they call him Time in the\nhighest heaven.  \n4\\. He surely did bring hither all the beings (worlds), he surely did\nencompass all the beings (worlds). Being their father, he became their son;\nthere is, verily, no other force, higher than he.  \n5\\. Time begot yonder heaven, Time also (begot) these earths. That which was,\nand that which shall be, urged forth by Time, spreads out.  \n6\\. Time created the earth, in Time the sun burns. In Time are all beings, in\nTime the eye looks abroad.  \n7\\. In Time mind is fixed, in Time breath (is fixed), in Time names (are\nfixed); when Time has arrived all these creatures rejoice.  \n8\\. In Time tapas (creative fervour) is fixed; in Time the highest (being is\nfixed); in Time brahma (spiritual exaltation) is fixed; Time is the lord of\neverything, he was the father of Pragapati.  \n9\\. By him this (universe) was urged forth, by him it was begotten, and upon\nhim this (universe) was founded. Time, truly, having become the brahma\n(spiritual exaltation), supports Parameshthin (the highest lord).  \n10\\. Time created the creatures (pragah), and Time in the beginning (created)\nthe lord of creatures (Pragapati); the self-existing Kasyapa and the tapas\n(creative fervour) from Time were born.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIX, 54.
