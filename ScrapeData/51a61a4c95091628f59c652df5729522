Thou art the Guest's Reception.  \nThee for Vishnu. Thee for the Soma-bringing Falcon.  \nThee for Vishnu. Thee for the giver of abundance, Agni.  \nThee for Vishnu.  \n2 Birth-place art thou of Agni. Ye are sprinklers. Thou art  \nUrvasi. Thou art \xc3\x82yu. Thou art Pururavas.  \nI rub and churn thee with Gayatri metre. I rub and churn  \nthee with the Trishtup metre. I rub and churn thee with,  \nthe Jagati metre.  \n3 Be ye for us one-minded, be one-thoughted, free from spot  \nand stain.  \nHarm not the sacrifice, harm not the sacrifice's lord. Be  \nkind to us this day, Omniscient Ones!  \n4 Preserver from the curse, Son of the Rishis, Agni is active  \nhaving entered Agni.  \nHere for us kindly with fair worship offer oblation to the  \nGods with care unceasing. Svaha!  \n5 For him who flies around and rushes onward I take thee,  \nfor Tanunapat the mighty, the very strong, of all-surpassing  \nvigour.\n\np. 35\n\nStrength of the Gods, inviolate, inviolable still art thou, the  \nstrength that turns the curse away, uncursed and never  \nto be cursed.  \nMay I go straight to truth. Place me in comfort.  \n6 O Agni, Guardian of the Vow, O Guardian of the Vow, in  \nthee  \nWhatever form there is of thine, may that same form be  \nhere on me: un thee be every form of mine.  \nO Lord of Vows, let our vows be united. May Diksha's  \nLord allow my Consecration, may holy Fervour's Lord  \napprove my Fervour.  \n7 May every stalk of thine wax full and strengthen for Indra  \nEkadhanavid, God Soma!  \nMay Indra grow in strength for thee: for Indra mayest thou  \ngrow strong.  \nIncrease us friends with strength and mental vigour. May  \nall prosperity be thine, God Soma. May I attain the  \nsolemn Soma-pressing.  \nMay longed-for wealth come forth for strength and fortune.  \nLet there be truth for those whose speech is truthful. To  \nHeaven and Earth be adoration offered.  \n8 That noblest body which is thine, O Agni, laid in the lowest  \ndeep, encased in iron, hath chased the awful word, the  \nword of terror. Svaha!  \nThat noblest . . . . . . encased in silver, etc. Svaha  \nThat noblest . . . . with gold around it, etc. Svaha!\n\np. 36\n\n9 For me thou art the home of the afflicted. For me thou art  \nthe gathering-place of riches. Protect me from the, woe  \nof destitution.  \nProtect me from the state of perturbation.  \nMay Agni know thee, he whose name is Nabhas. Go, Agni,  \nAngiras, with the name of \xc3\x82yu.  \nThou whom this earth containeth, down I lay thee with each  \ninviolate holy name thou bearest.  \nThou whom the second earth, etc. Thou whom the third  \nearth, etc.  \nThee, further, for the Gods\xc2\x92 delight.  \n10 A foe-subduing lioness art thou: be fitted for the Gods.  \nA foe-subduing lioness art thou: be purified for Gods.  \nA foe-subduing lioness art thou: adorn thyself for Gods.  \n11 Indra's shout guard thee in the front with Vasus. The Wise  \nOne guard thee from the rear with Rudras. The Thought-swift  \nguard thee on the right with Fathers. The Omnific  \nguard thee, leftward, with \xc3\x82dityas.  \nThis heated water I eject and banish from the sacrifice.  \n12 Thou art a lioness. All-hail! Thou art a lioness winning  \n\xc3\x82dityas. All-hail!  \nThou art a lioness winning Brahmans and Nobles. All-hail!  \nThou art a lioness that wins fair offspring, win abundant  \nwealth. All-hail!  \nA lioness art thou. Bring the Gods hither for him who  \noffers sacrifice. All-hail!  \nTo living creatures; thee.\n\np. 37\n\n13 Firm art thou, steady thou the earth. Firm-seated art thou,  \nsteady thou the air.  \nMovelessly set art thou, steady the sky. Agni's completion  \nart thou.  \n14 The priests of him the lofty Priest well-skilled in hymns  \nharness their spirits, yea harness their holy thoughts.  \nHe only knowing works assigns their priestly tasks. Yea,  \nlofty is the praise of Savitar the God. All-hail!  \n15 Forth through This All strode Vishnu: thrice his foot he  \nplanted, and the whole was gathered in his footstep's dust.  \nAll-hail!  \n16 Rich in sweet food be ye, and rich in milch-kine, with fertile  \npastures, fair to do men service.  \nBoth these worlds, Vishnu, hast thou stayed asunder, and  \nfirmly fixed the earth with pegs around it.  \n17 Heard by the Gods, ye twain, to Gods proclaim it.  \nGo eastward, O ye twain, proclaiming worship. Swerve ye  \nnot: bear the sacrifice straight upward.  \nTo your own cow-pen speak, ye godlike dwellings.  \nSpeak not away my life, speak not away my children.  \nOn the earth's summit here may ye be joyful.\n\np. 38\n\n18 Now will I tell the mighty deeds of Vishnu, of him who  \nmeasured out the earthly regions.  \nWho propped the highest place of congregation, thrice setting  \ndown his foot and widely striding.  \nFor Vishnu thee.  \n19 Either from heaven or from the earth, O Vishnu, or, Vishnu,  \nfrom the vast wide air's mid-region,  \nFill both thy hands full with abundant riches, and from the  \nright and from the left bestow them.  \nFor Vishnu thee.  \n20 For this his mighty deed is Vishnu lauded, like some wild  \nbeast, dread, prowling, mountain-roaming,  \nHe within whose three wide-extended paces all living creatures  \nhave their habitation,  \n21 Thou art the frontlet for the brow of Vishnu. Ye are the  \ncorners of the mouth of Vishnu. Thou art the needle  \nfor the work of Vishnu. Thou art the firmly-fastened knot  \nof Vishnu. To Vishnu thou belongest. Thee for Vishnu.  \n22 By impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins  \nand with hands of Pushan.  \nThou art a woman. Here I cut the necks of Rakshasas away.  \nMighty art thou, mighty the sound thou makest. Utter thy  \nmighty-sounding voice to Indra:  \n23 Fiend-killing, charm-destroying voice of Vishnu.  \nHere I cast out that charm of magic power which stranger  \nor housemate for me hath buried.\n\np. 39\n\nHere I cast out the charm of magic power buried for me  \nby equal or unequal.  \nHere I cast out the charm that hath been buried for me by  \nnon-relation or relation.  \nI cast the charm of magic out.  \n24 Self-ruler art thou, conquering foes. Ruler for ever art  \nthou, killing enemies.  \nMen's ruler art thou, slaying fiends. All ruler, killing foes,  \nart thou.  \n25 I sprinkle you whom Vishnu owns, killers of fiends and evil  \ncharms.  \nI buy down you whom Vishnu loves, killers of fiends and  \nwicked charms.  \nI scatter you whom Vishnu loves, killers of fiends and  \nwicked charms.  \nYou two whom Vishnu loves, who kill fiends and ill charms  \ndo I lay down.  \nYou two whom Vishnu loves, who kill fiends and ill charms  \nI compass round.  \nTo Vishnu thou belongest. Ye are Vishnu's.  \n26 By impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,  \nwith the hands of Peahen.  \nThou art a woman. Here I cut the necks of Rakshasas away.  \nBarley art thou. Bar off from us our haters, bar our enemies.  \nThee for heaven, thee for earth, thee for air's region.  \nPure be the worlds, the Fathers\xc2\x92 dwelling-places. Thou art  \nthe habitation of the Fathers.\n\np. 40\n\n27 Prop heaven, fill full the air, on earth stand firmly. Dyutana,  \noffspring of the Maruts, plant thee!, Mitra and Varuna  \nwith firm upholding.  \nI close thee in, thou winner of the Brahmans, winner of  \nNobles and abundant riches.  \nStrengthen the Brahmans, strengthen thou the Nobler,  \nstrengthen our vital power, strengthen our offspring.  \n28 Firm-set art thou. Firm be this Sacrificer within this home  \nwith offspring and with cattle.  \nO Heaven and Earth, be ye filled full of fatness.  \nIndra's mat art thou, shelter of all people.  \n29 Lover of song, may these our songs encompass thee on every  \nside;  \nStrengthening thee of lengthened life, may they be dear  \ndelights to thee  \n30 Thou art the needle for the work of Indra. Thou art the  \nfirmly fastened knot of Indra. Indra's art thou. Thou art  \nthe Visvedevas\xc2\x92.  \n31 All-present art thou, carrying off. Oblation-bearing priest  \nart thou.  \nThou art the Swift, the Very Wise. Tutha art thou, who  \nknoweth all.  \n32 Thou art the yearning one, the sage. Angnari, Bambhari  \nart thou.\n\np. 41\n\nAid-seeker art thou, worshipping. Cleanser art thou, the  \ncleansing-place. Krisanu, Sovran Lord, art thou.  \nThou art the Pavamana of the assembly. Thou art the  \nwelkin ever moving forward. Swept clean art thou, preparer  \nof oblations. Thou art the seat of Law, heaven's light  \nand lustre.  \n33 A sea art thou of all-embracing compass. Aja art thou, who  \nhath one foot to bear him. Thou art the Dragon of the  \nDepths of ocean. Speech art thou, thou the Sadas, thou  \nart Indra's. Doors of the sacrifice, do not distress me!  \nLord, Ruler of the pathways, lead me onward. In this God-reaching  \npath may I be happy.  \n34 Look ye upon me with the eye of Mitra.  \nO Agnis, ye, receivers of oblations, are by a lauded name  \nlauded together. Protect me, Agnis! with your glittering  \narmy. Fill me with riches, Agnis! be my keepers. To  \nyou be adoration. Do not harm me.  \n35 Thou art a light that wears all forms and figures, serving  \nthe general host of Gods as Kindler.\n\np. 42\n\nThou, Soma, wilt withhold thy wide protection from body-wounding  \nhatreds shown by others. All-hail!  \nLet the Swift graciously enjoy the butter. All-hail!  \n36 By goodly paths lead us to riches, Agni, thou God who  \nknowest every sacred duty.  \nRemove the sin that makes us stray and wander: most  \nample adoration will we bring thee.  \n37 Wide room and comfort may this Agni give us, and go before  \nus cleaving down our foemen.  \nMay he win booty in the fight for booty: May he quell foes  \nin his triumphant onset.  \n38 O Vishnu, stride thou widely forth, give ample room for our  \nabode.  \nDrink butter, homed in butter! Still speed on the sacrifice's  \nlord. All-hail!  \n39 To thee, God Savitar, belongs this Soma. Guard him securely:  \nlet not demons harm thee.  \nNow hast thou joined the Gods as God, God Soma: men  \nhave I joined here through abundant riches.  \nAll-hail! from Varuna's noose am I delivered.  \n40 O Agni, Guardian of the Vow, O Guardian of the Vow, on  \nme whatever form of thine path been, may that same  \nform be upon thee. Whatever form of mine hath been on  \nthee, may that he here on me.  \nO Lord of Vows, our vows have been accomplished. Diksha's  \nLord hath approved my Consecration, and holy Fervour's  \nLord allowed my Fervour.  \n41 O Vishnu, stride thou widely forth, make ample room for  \nour abode.  \nDrink butter, homed in butter! Still speed on the sacrifice's  \nlord. All Hail!\n\np. 43\n\n42 I have passed others, not approached to others. On the near  \nside of those that were more distant, and farther than  \nthe nearer have I found thee.  \nSo, for the worship of the Gods, with gladness we welcome  \nthee God, Sovran of the Forest! Let the Gods welcome  \nthee for the Gods\xc2\x92 service. For Vishnu thee. Plant, guard!!  \nAxe, do not harm it!  \n43 Graze not the sky. Harm not mid-air. Be in accordance with  \nthe earth.  \nFor this well-sharpened axe hath led thee forth to great  \nfelicity.  \nHence, with a hundred branches, God, Lord of the Forest,  \ngrow thou up.  \nMay we grow spreading with a hundred branches.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book VI](wyvbk06.htm)\n\n"
