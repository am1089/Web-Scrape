This fundamental principle of acceptance of God\'s _will_ among the\nreligious becomes the reception of God\'s _being_ among the mystics.\n\nIn the efforts and attainments of these mystics must be recognized therefore\n_two_ operators\xc2\x97God who is trying to give himself to man, and man who is\ntrying to give himself to God. The second of these factors, the human efforts,\nnaturally takes on the aspect of yoga practice\xc2\x97purification of the self from\nworldly desires, mental defects and selfish motives, often by\n\np. 154\n\nmeans of frequent deep and prolonged meditation, and even by physical\nasceticism, intended in some cases to reduce the body to submission, and in\nothers to demonstrate submission achieved.\n\nIt was indeed from one of these practices that the very name "Sufi" was\nadopted\xc2\x97the wearing of woolen garments by these mystics and yog\xc4\xabs, a mild\nequivalent of the Christian hair shirt. The word "sufi" is derived from a word\nmeaning wool.\n\nThe foundations of the contrast between material riches and the presence of\nGod which has had great influence in the Sufi life were laid by Muhammad\nhimself, when he said "Poverty is my pride," and rejected the personal use of\nriches, as well as in the example of earlier Prophets, including Moses, David\nand Jesus. Many were the Sufi ascetics and mystics who gave up wealth and\npursued the simple life.\n\nIt was, however, always the constant thought or remembrance ( _dhikr_ ) of God\nthat was considered the means to Union ( _tauhid_ ) with Him, in which there\nwas the passing away ( _fana_ ) of all the human qualities or human nature,\nthe only continuity ( _bava_ ) being then the continuity of God Himself.\nStudents of comparative yoga will see in this a similarity to Buddha\'s\ndoctrine of _Nibbanna_ , or _Nirv \xc4\x81na_, in the achievement of which every\nvestige of what man can think or feel himself to be entirely disappears. This\n\np. 155\n\ntransformation of the Sufi could take place during life, but woe to the man\nwho might say that he had become God. The true idea is quite different from\nthat. It is a dying to self. The orthodox of Islam would never allow a man to\ncall himself God, or permit the idea that God would appear in or through human\nform. All its inspirers were regarded only as Prophets, of whom Muhammad was\nthe greatest, and the height of their message was loss of self in God. When\nman is lost in God, the continuity is God\'s, not man\'s.\n\nThe technicalities of Sufi yoga practice were never codified with the\nexactitude found among the Hindus and Buddhists, though it must be said that\nSufi teachers in India sometimes adopted portions of the Hindu meditational\nmethods, without abating the essential aim of devotional submission. The\npresent writer became acquainted with one Sufi teacher in the north of India\nwho had sixteen thousand disciples or followers within a radius of about fifty\nmiles, and was using methods of meditation the same as those of one of the\nHindu schools. This brings to attention the fact that although there are many\n"sanny\xc4\x81s\xc4\xab" Sufis wandering about with musical instruments and singing\ndevotional songs, still the bulk were and are people in ordinary occupations,\nas is the case with Hindu aspirants also.\n\np. 156\n\nMusic plays an important part in the life of most of the Sufis in India,\nfollowing the Mevlavi Order established by Maulana Jatal al-Din R\xc5\xabm\xc4\xab. It is\nnot only through the eye that things can tell us of their essential being. To\ngo along with the experiences in perfect harmony, even unity, is the height of\na sort of meditation which conveys experience beyond thought and reason. Every\nbeing acts from its own character, and usually the seeing or experiencing is\nlimited to the material gain\xc2\x97so a worm sees a tree in one way, a bird in\nanother, a monkey in another, a worldly man in another. But a spiritual man\nmust see it in another way, without the antagonism and conquesting of his\nreasoning mind, but with acceptance, harmony and flowing\xc2\x97with, in short, a\nsort of meditativeness which excludes reason. On this account the allegories\nof Love and Wine came to fill the poetry of the Sufis. Thus one can understand\nstanza 60 of Omar Khayyam\'s _Rubaiyat_ :\n\nYou know, my friends, with what a brave carouse  \nI made a second marriage in my house,  \n     Divorced old barren Reason from my bed  \nAnd took the Daughter of the Vine to spouse.\n\nIn this sort of meditativeness or lovefull attentiveness there is experience\nabove reason, above expression in words. This was usual with Emerson, so he\ncould write:\n\np. 157\n\nCans\xc2\x92t thou copy in verse one chime  \nOf the wood-bell\'s peal and cry,  \nWrite in a book the morning\'s prime,  \nOr match with words that tender sky?\n\nWonderful verse of the gods,  \nOf one import, of varied tone;  \nThey chant the bliss of their abodes  \nTo man imprisoned in his own.\n\nEver the words of the gods resound;  \nBut the porches of man\'s ear  \nSeldom in this low life\'s round  \nAre unsealed, that he may hear.\n\nMoulana R\xc5\xabm\xc4\xab expressed the longing of Love in the following verses translated\nby R. A. Nicholson in his book _R \xc5\xabm\xc4\xab, Poet and Mystic_:\n\nHearken to this Reed forlorn,  \nBreathing, ever since \xc2\x92twas born  \nFrom its rushy bed, a strain  \nOf impassioned love and pain.\n\nThe secret of my song, though near,  \nNone can see and none can hear.  \nOh, for a friend to know the sign  \nAnd mingle all his soul with mine!\n\n\xc2\x92Tis the flame of Love that fired me,  \n\xc2\x92Tis the wine of Love inspired me.  \nWoulds\xc2\x92t thou learn how lovers bleed,  \nHearken, hearken to the Reed!\n\np. 158\n\nIt is part of the technique of Sufism to be on guard not to fail in this Love,\nor unantagonistic looking, in oneself as in all. There is no self-fighting in\nthis. Look with Love, and the divine "intoxication" of the Wine will come. As\nR\xc5\xabm\xc4\xab, again, said:\n\nInto my heart\'s night  \nAlong a narrow way  \nI groped; and lo! the light,  \nAn infinite land of day.\n\nThis awareness of the real man is put in less direct terms in the poem on\n_Body and Soul_ by another Persian poet, Enweri\xc2\x97translated in Emerson\'s essay\non Persian Poetry:\n\nA painter in China once painted a hall;  \nSuch a web never hung on an emperor\'s wall;\xc2\x97  \nOne half from his brush with rich colors did run,  \nThe other he touched with a beam of the sun;  \nSo that all which delighted the eye in one side,  \nThe same, point for point, in the other replied.  \nIn thee, friend, that Tyrian chamber is found;  \nThine the star-pointing roof, and the base on the ground:  \nIs one half depicted with colors less bright?  \nBeware that the counterpart blazes with light!\n\n"Beware" means, of course, "be aware."\n\nWe may find room in this short introduction to Sufi yoga for two verses, vi\n17-18\xc2\x97very percipient\xc2\x97from Richard Burton\'s _Kas \xc4\xabdah_:\n\nYes Truth may be, but \'tis not Here; mankind must seek and find it There, p.\n159  \nBut Where nor _I_ nor _you_ can tell, nor aught earth-mother ever bare.\n\nEnough to think that Truth can be: come sit we where the roses glow,  \nIndeed he knows not how to know who knows not also how to unknow.\n\nCease, then, your own Almighty Power to bind, to bound, to understand.\n\nIn his book _Sufism_ , Prof. A. J. Arberry gives a list of the meanings of\nterms used in much of the Sufi love-poetry, compiled from a treatise by Muhsin\nFaid K\xc4\x81sh\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab, a Persian author of two centuries ago. Among these are the Face\nor Cheek (Divine Beauty, Grace, Bounty, Light, Reality), the Tresses (Majesty,\nPower, the veil of Reality), Mole (point of Unity), Eye and Glance (God\'s\nbeholding and granting), Eyebrow (the attributes which veil the Essence), Wine\n(ecstatic experience), Wine-bearer (Reality, loving to manifest itself in\nevery form), Cup, Pitcher and Jar (revelations of Divine Acts, Names and\nQualities), Sea and Ocean (revelations of Divine Essence), Tavern (Pure\nUnity)\xc2\x97but see Professor Arberry\'s book for a fuller list and details.\n\nIn the Sufi yoga it is separation ( _tauh \xc4\xabd_) that is to be overcome. Every\naspirant is free to follow the means of his own choice to this end, with or\nwithout the technique of any particular teacher. Professor Arberry\n\np. 160\n\nhas given lists of the "stations" reached by the aspirant\'s own endeavours and\nthe "states" which he receives from God, these not being in the power of human\nnature to produce for itself, according to three of the ancient writers. The\nsimplest of these lists is that of al-Sarr\xc4\x81j, who gives seven "stations"\xc2\x97the\nconversion from formal religion to the resolution to achieve, abstinence from\nunnecessary and unsuitable activities, renunciation of pleasures, poverty,\npatience, trust in God and satisfaction\xc2\x97and ten "states"\xc2\x97meditation, nearness\nto God, love, fear, hope, longing, intimacy, tranquillity, contemplation and\ncertainty. 1\n\nThe part played by music in the devotional yoga of the Sufis has been told\nvery beautifully by Inayat Khan in his _Mysticism of Sound_. Moulana R\xc5\xabm\xc4\xab\nespecially valued the help of music, so it came strongly into the devotions of\nthe Mevlavi Order of Sufis. A branch of this order came to India, and was\ncarried to great heights by Khaja Moinudin Chisti. For many centuries at his\ntomb in Ajmere there has always been and still is the best of music and\nsinging to be heard. At some of the assemblies of this order, the ecstasy (\n_Wajad_ ) of union has three degrees of attainment\xc2\x97objective, ideal and\necstatic. When this ecstasy\n\np. 161\n\ncomes, sometimes it manifests itself in tears, sometimes in sighs, sometimes\nin actions.\n\nAlthough this takes place practically there is also a theory of the abstract\nor unlimited sound, for which the devotee can listen anywhere in nature. This\nalso involves the method of abstractedness through sound which we find among\nthe Hindus as well as the Sufis. This sound has ten forms, it is said, in ten\ndifferent channels of the human body; it may be like thunder, the roar of the\nsea, bells, running water, bees, sparrows, the lute, a whistle, a conch-shell,\nand, highest of all, the sound of _Hu_. The last is found dwelling in all the\nother sounds as their spirit, as it were. Like the Om of the Hindus, it is\nregarded as the name of the Nameless, constantly sounded by Nature. When\necstasy comes the Sufi forgets mental as well as physical existence. The\neffect, however, is throughout; body and mind are purified and made able to\nreceive intuitions.\n\nIn writing even briefly of the aims and techniques of the Sufis one must not\nomit the dancing or whirling of the Dervishes, not seen in India, but in Egypt\nand some other countries. These take various forms, as shown by E. W. Lane in\nhis _Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians_. Remembrance ( _zikr_ )\naccompanies the practice, in the form of repetitions of the\n\np. 162\n\n[paragraph continues] "Allah," with or without additional exclamations. The\nfollowing is an extract from Lane:\n\nThe durweeshes, who formed the large ring (which enclosed four of the marble\ncolumns of the portico) now commenced their zikr; exclaiming over and over\nagain, "Allah!" and, at each exclamation, bowing the head and body, and taking\na step to the right; so that the whole ring moved rapidly round. As soon as\nthey commenced this exercise, another durweesh, a Turk, of the order of\nMowlawees, in the middle of the circle, began to whirl; using both his feet to\neffect this motion, and extending his arms; the motion increasing in velocity\nuntil his dress spread out like an umbrella. He continued whirling thus for\nabout ten minutes; after which he bowed to his superior, who stood within the\ngreat ring; and then, without showing any signs of fatigue or giddiness,\njoined the durweeshes in the great ring; who had now begun to ejaculate the\nname of God with greater vehemence, and to jump to the right, instead of\nstepping. After whirling, six other durweeshes, within the great ring, formed\nanother ring; but a very small one; each placing his arms upon the shoulders\nof those next him; and thus disposed, they performed a revolution similar to\nthat of the larger ring, except in being much more rapid; repeating, also, the\nsame exclamation of "Allah!" but with a rapidity proportionately greater. This\nmotion they maintained for about the same length of time that the whirling of\nthe single durweesh before had occupied; after which, the whole party sat down\nto rest. They rose again after the lapse of about a quarter of an hour; and\nperformed the same exercises a second time. 2\n\np. 163\n\nPrefacing his poem _Song of Seid Nimetollah of Kuhistan_ , Emerson has a note\non another form of this dance, as follows:\n\nAmong the religious customs of the dervishes is an astronomical dance, in\nwhich the dervish imitates the movements of the heavenly bodies, by spinning\non his own axis, whilst at the same time he revolves round the Sheikh in the\ncentre, representing the sun; and, as he spins, he sings the Song of Seid\nNimetollah of Kuhistan.\n\nThe first portion of the Song tells what state of mind the dancers are trying\nto reach:\n\nSpin the ball! I reel, I burn,  \nNor head from foot can I discern,  \nNor my heart from love of mine,  \nNor the wine-cup from the wine.  \nAll my doing, all my leaving,  \nReaches not to my perceiving;  \nLost in whirling spheres I rove,  \nAnd know only that I love.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[160:1](gsoy11.htm#fr_81) See _Sufism_ , by A.
