The Sadas 3 is no other than his (Vish _n_ u, the sacrifice's)\nbelly; therefore they feed (drink) in the\n\np. 141\n\n[paragraph continues] Sadas; for whatever food is eaten here on earth, all\nthat settles down in the belly. And because all the gods sat (sad) in it,\ntherefore it is called sadas: and so do these Brahmans of every family now sit\ntherein. By way of deity it belongs to Indra.\n\n3:6:1:22\\. In the middle of it he puts up a (post) of udumbara wood (Ficus\nGlomerata); for the udumbara means strength and food; now the Sadas being his\n(Vish _n_ u's belly), he thereby puts food therein; this is why he puts up an\nudumbara (post) in the middle of it.\n\n3:6:1:33\\. From the peg 1 which stands in the middle on the hind-part of the\naltar, he strides six steps eastwards (along the 'spine'); the seventh he\nstrides away from it to the right, for the sake of completeness, and there\nmarks off a pit.\n\n3:6:1:44\\. He takes the spade with (Va _g_. S. V, 26), 'At the impulse of the\ndivine Savit _ri_ , I take thee with the arms of the A _s_ vins, with the\nhands of Pushan: thou art a woman;' the significance of this formula is the\nsame (as before). That spade, indeed, is a female (feminine): therefore. he\nsays 'thou art a woman.'\n\n3:6:1:55\\. He then marks off the pit with, 'Herewith\n\np. 142\n\n[paragraph continues] I cut off the necks of the Rakshas!' for the spade is\nthe thunderbolt: it is with the thunderbolt that he cuts off the necks of the\nevil spirits.\n\n3:6:1:66\\. Thereupon he digs: eastwards he throws up the heap of earth. Having\nmade the udumbara (post) of the same size as the sacrificer 1, he cuts it\nsmooth all round, and lays it down, with the top to the east, in front (of the\npit). Thereon he lays barhis-grass of the same length.\n\n3:6:1:77\\. Now the sprinkling-water (used on this occasion) contains barley-\ncorns. For the essence (sap) of plants is water; wherefore plants when eaten\nalone do not satiate; and the essence of water, on the other hand, are the\nplants; wherefore water when drunk alone does not satiate; but only when the\ntwo are united they satiate; for then they are sapful: 'with the sapful I will\nsprinkle,' so he thinks.\n\n3:6:1:88\\. Now, the gods and the [Asuras](errata.htm#1), both of them sprung\nfrom Pra _g_ apati, were contending. Then all the plants went away from the\ngods, but the barley plants alone went not from them.\n\n3:6:1:99\\. The gods then prevailed: by means of these (barley-grains) they\nattracted to themselves all the plants of their enemies; and because they\nattracted (yu) therewith, therefore they are called yava (barley).\n\n3:6:1:1010\\. They said, 'Come, let us put into the barley whatever sap there\nis of all plants!' And, accordingly, whatever sap there was of all plants,\nthat they put into the barley: therefore the latter thrives lustily where\nother plants wither, for in such wise\n\np. 143\n\ndid they put the sap into them. And in like manner does this one now by means\nof those (barley-grains) attract to himself all the plants of his enemies:\nthis is why the sprinkling-water contains barley-corns.\n\n3:6:1:1111\\. He throws the barley-corns into it, with, 'Thou art barley\n(yava): keep thou (yavaya) from us the haters, keep from us the enemies!' In\nthis there is nothing obscure. He then besprinkles (the post);--the\nsignificance of the sprinkling is one and the same: he thereby renders it\nsacrificially pure.\n\n3:6:1:1212\\. He sprinkles (the top, middle, and bottom parts), with, 'For the\nsky--thee! for the air--thee! for the earth--thee!' He thereby endows these\nworlds with strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on these worlds.\n\n3:6:1:1313\\. And the sprinkling-water which remains he pours into the hole,\nwith, 'Be the worlds pure wherein the Fathers reside!' for a pit that is dug\nis sacred to the Fathers: this he thereby renders sacrificially pure.\n\n3:6:1:1414\\. He now strews barhis-grass therein, both eastward-pointed and\nnorthward-pointed with, 'Thou art the seat of the Fathers;' for that part of\nit (the post) which is dug into the ground is sacred to the Fathers; as though\nit were (naturally) established 1 among plants, and not dug in, so does it\nbecome established among those plants.\n\n3:6:1:1515\\. He raises it, with the text (Va _g_. S. V, 27), 'Prop thou the\nsky! fill the air! stand firm on the earth!' Thereby he endows these worlds\nwith strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on these worlds.\n\np. 144\n\n3:6:1:1616\\. He then sinks it (in the hole, with), 'May Dyutana, the son of\nthe Maruts, plant thee!--' Dyutana the son of the Maruts, doubtless, is he\nthat blows yonder (the wind): by means of him he thus plants it;--'Mitra and\nVaru _n_ a with firm support!' Mitra and Varu _n_ a are the in-breathing and\nout-breathing: he thus plants it with the in-breathing and out-breathing.\n\n3:6:1:1717\\. He then heaps up (earth) round it, with, 'I enclose thee, winner\nof the priesthood, winner of the nobility, winner of growth of wealth!'\nManifold, verily, is the prayer for blessing in the sacrificial texts: by this\none he prays for the priesthood and nobility, those two vital forces 1.\n'Winner of growth of wealth,'--growth of wealth means abundance: he thereby\nprays for abundance.\n\n3:6:1:1818\\. He then presses it firmly all round, with, 'Uphold thou the\npriesthood! uphold the nobility, uphold our life, uphold our progeny!' this is\nthe blessing of this rite: that blessing he thereby invokes. He presses it so\nas to be level with the ground: with an (ordinary) hole (round trees for\nwatering) it is higher than the ground, but in this way it is with the\ngods;--and thus it is not planted in an (ordinary) hole.\n\n3:6:1:1919\\. He then pours water thereon;--wherever, in digging, they wound or\ninjure this (earth),--water being a means of soothing,--there he soothes it by\nthat means of soothing, water, there he heals it by water: therefore he pours\nwater thereon.\n\np. 145\n\n3:6:1:2020\\. He then makes (the sacrificer) say, while touching it thus (Va\n_g_. S. V, 28), 'Thou art firm: may this sacrificer be firm in this homestead\nthrough progeny'--or, 'through cattle!' thus whatever wish he entertains that\nwish is accomplished unto him.\n\n3:6:1:2121\\. Thereupon, having taken clarified butter with the dipping-spoon,\nhe pours it upon the (forked) top 1, with 'O Heaven and Earth, be ye full of\nghee!' whereby he endows the heaven and the earth with strength and sap,\nbestows strength and sap on them: upon them thus full of sap and affording\nsubsistence, these creatures subsist.\n\n3:6:1:2222\\. He then lays on a mat 2, with, 'Thou art Indra's mat,'--for the\nSadas belongs to Indra,--'a shelter to every one,' for Brahmans of all\nfamilies sit therein. He adds two mats, one on each side thereof, and three\nnorth of them and three further (to the north): these make nine. For the\nsacrifice\n\np. 146\n\nis threefold and nine also is threefold: for this reason there are nine.\n\n3:6:1:2323\\. That Sadas has its tie-beams running (from south) to north, and\nthe cart-shed (from west) to east. For this, the cart-shed, belongs\nexclusively to the gods: hence neither food nor drink is taken therein,\nbecause it belongs exclusively to the gods; and were any one either to eat or\nto drink therein, his head would verily burst asunder. But those two, the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra and the Sadas, are common (to the gods and men): hence food and drink\nis taken in these two, because they are common (to the gods and men). Now the\nnorth is the quarter of men: therefore the Sadas has its tie-beams running\n(from south) to north.\n\n3:6:1:2424\\. They enclose it 1, with the text (Va _g_. S. V, 29; Rig-veda I,\n10, 12), 'May these songs encompass thee on every side, O thou that delightest\nin songs! May these favours be favourably received by thee, invigorating the\nvigorous!' He that delights in songs, forsooth, is Indra, and songs mean the\npeople: he thus surrounds the nobility with the people, and therefore the\nnobility is here surrounded on both sides by the people.\n\n3:6:1:2525\\. Thereupon he sews (the hurdles to the posts) with a needle and\ncord 2, with the text (Va _g_. S. V, 30), 'Thou art Indra's sewer.' With,\n'Thou art Indra's fixed (point),' he then makes a knot, 'lest it should fall\nasunder.' He undoes it again, when the work is completed; and thus disease\nbefalls not either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer. When completed, he\n\np. 147\n\ntouches it (the Sadas) with, 'Thou art Indra's own!' for the Sadas belongs to\nIndra.\n\n3:6:1:2626\\. In the north--with regard to the back part of the Soma-carts\n1\\--he then raises the \xc3\x82gnidhra (shed). One half of it should be inside the\naltar, and one half outside; or more than one half may be inside the altar and\nless outside; or the whole of it may be inside the altar. When completed, he\ntouches it with, 'Thou art the All-gods' own!' To the All-gods it belongs,\nbecause on the day before (the Soma feast) the All-gods abide in it by the\nVasativari water.\n\n3:6:1:2727\\. Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were\nafraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas. The Asura-Rakshas\nattacked them from the south and forced them out of the Sadas, and overturned\nthose hearths (dhish _n_ ya) of theirs which are within the Sadas.\n\n3:6:1:2828\\. For, indeed, all of those (hearths) at one time burnt as brightly\nas this \xc3\x82havaniya and the Garhapatya and the \xc3\x82gnidhriya; but ever since that\ntime when they (the Asuras) overturned them they do not burn. They forced them\n(the gods) back to the \xc3\x82gnidhra (fire) and even won from them one half of the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra. From there the All-gods gained immortality 2,--whence it (the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra fire) is sacred to the All-gods.\n\np. 148\n\n3:6:1:2929\\. The gods kindled them again, as one would (light the fire where\nhe is going to) stay. Therefore they are kindled at every Soma feast.\nWherefore the duties of the Agnidh should be discharged by one who is\naccomplished. Now he who is known and learned in sacred lore 1 is truly\naccomplished: hence they take to the Agnidh his Dakshi _n_ a first 2, since it\nis from thence (from the Agnidh's fire) that the gods gained immortality. And\nif weakness were to come upon one of those that are consecrated, let (the\nAdhvaryu) say, 'Lead him to the \xc3\x82gnidhra!'--thinking 'that is unscathed, there\nhe will not meet with affliction 3.' And because the All-gods gained\nimmortality from there, therefore it is sacred to the All-gods.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[140:3](sbe2623.htm#fr_380) The Sadas is a shed or tent, facing the east with\nits long side, which is to measure eighteen (or twenty-one, or twenty-four,\nor, according to the _S_ ulva-sutra, twenty-seven) cubits, the breadth by p.\n141 six cubits (or ten, or one half that of the long side). The udumbara post,\naccording to some, is to stand exactly in the centre of the shed; or,\naccording to others, at an equal distance from the (long) east and west sides;\nthe 'spine' (cf. [p. 112](sbe2619.htm#page_112), note [2](sbe2619.htm#fn_294))\nin that case dividing the building into two equal parts, a northern and a\nsouthern one. In the middle the shed is to be of the sacrificer's height, and\nfrom thence the ceiling is to slant towards the ends where it is to reach up\nto the sacrificer's navel. According to the Black Ya _g_ us, the erection of\nthe Sadas precedes the digging of the Uparavas, described in the preceding\nBrahma _n_ a. Taitt. S.

Saya _n_ a on Taitt. S.\nI, 3, I; Katy. VIII, 5, 37 seq.\n\n[145:2](sbe2623.htm#fr_386) That is, after putting up the posts of the front\nand back doors, and laying the beams on, both longways and crossways, in the\nsame way as was done in erecting the Pra _k_ inava _m_ _s_ a and Havirdhana,\nhe is to spread over the beams the nine mats that are to form the ceiling,--\nviz. first the middle, and then the two others, of the three southern ones,\nthereupon three alongside these, across the central part of the shed, and\nfinally the three across the north side. According to some authorities the\ncentral mats are laid down first, and then those on the south and north sides.\nSee Saya _n_ a on Taitt. S. I, 3, 1 (p. 450).\n\n[146:1](sbe2623.htm#fr_387) Viz. with hurdles, or upright grass-mats, fastened\nto the doorposts by means of cord.\n\n[146:2](sbe2623.htm#fr_388) See [III, 5, 3, 25](sbe2621.htm#3:5:3:25).\n\n[147:1](sbe2623.htm#fr_389) North of the clog (apalamba) of the carts, Ka _n_\nva rec.\n\n[147:2](sbe2623.htm#fr_390) They gained it, as would seem, by means of the\nother half of the \xc3\x82gnidhra fire.
