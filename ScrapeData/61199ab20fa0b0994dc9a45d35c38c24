Upon this, the three\ngods, Bruhmu, Vishnu and Roodru, came and enquired, "Why do you perform such\nexcessively severe penance?" The earth replied, "O seas of compassion! I am\nvery desirous of having a son; and am therefore performing this great penance;\nhave compassion on me and grant that I may have a very powerful, renowned and\nglorious son, who shall not have an equal in the world, and who shall never\ndie." The three gods were delighted at hearing these words; and, having\ngranted the boon she solicited, said, "Thy son, by name Nurkasoor, shall be\nvery potent, and of great reputation, and no one shall obtain a victory over\nhim in battle. He shall conquer, and bring under subjection, all the kings of\nthe world; having gone to the sky, he shall destroy and put to flight the\ngods, and carrying off the ear-rings of Aditee, the mother of the gods, shall\nwear them himself, and carry off and place the canopy of Indru over his own\nhead. He shall collect together, without marrying them, sixteen thousand one\nhundred virgin daughters of different Rajas. Shree Krishnu Chund shall then\nattack him with all his army, and you shall tell him to\n\np. 272\n\nkill your son, which he will do, and take away with him to Dwarka all the\nRajas\' daughters."\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O great king! when the three gods, having granted the boon, had\nthus spoken, the earth said, "Why should I ever tell any one to kill my son?"\nand was silent. After the lapse of some days, the earth\'s son, Bhomasoor, was\nborn, who is also called Nurkasoor; and dwelt in Pragojotikpore. The city was\nprotected on all sides by hills; and, having built forts of water, fire and\nair, he carried off by violence the young daughters of all the Rajas in the\nworld, and brought them, and kept them there with their nurses. He was\nincessantly occupied with arrangements for their food and clothes, and brought\nthem up with the greatest care. One day, Bhomasoor was in a great passion, and\nsitting in a chariot of flowers he had brought from Lunka (Ceylon,) went to\nthe regions above, and began to vex the gods. From the troubles he brought\nupon them, the gods fled for their lives in every direction, abandoning their\ncelestial abodes. He then carried off the ear-rings of the mother of the gods\nand the canopy of Indru, and began to inflict great griefs on all the gods,\nmortals and sages of the world.\n\nHaving heard of all his practices, Shree Krishnu Chund, the brother of the\nworld, said to himself, "I will destroy him, and carry off all the women, and\nwill convey Indru\'s canopy to the celestial regions, I will restore Aditee\'s\near-rings, and will arrange that Indru shall govern, free from all fear."\n\nShree Krishnu Chund then said to Sutbhama, "O wife! if you come with me,\nBhomasoor shall be put to death; because you are a portion of the earth, and\nin this manner are his mother. When the gods granted the earth the boon of a\nson, they said to her, \'Thy son shall die, when thou givest the order:\notherwise, no one will be able to put him to death.\'" Sutbhama, hearing and\nreflecting upon these words, remained thoughtful. "O great king! my son is\nalso your\n\np. 273\n\nson; why will you kill him?" Krishnu evaded this question, and said, "I am not\nvery anxious to destroy him; but on one occasion, I made you a promise, which\nI wish to fulfil." Sutbhama enquired, "What promise?" Krishnu said, "Narud Jee\nonce came, and gave me a flower of the tree Kulpu, which I sent to Rookmunee.\nYou were angry, when you heard of this. I then made an agreement, that if you\nwould not be uneasy, I would bring the Kulpu tree to you. I, therefore, take\nyou with me, in order that I may fulfil my promise, and show you the paradise\nof Vishnu."\n\nSutbhama was much pleased at hearing these words, and prepared to accompany\nHuri; who seated her behind him on the sovereign of the feathered race, the\nvehicle of Vishnu, and set off on his journey. After they had gone some\ndistance, Shree Krishnu Chund said to Sutbhama, "Say, truly, why were you\ndispleased, when I first mentioned this subject to you; explain the reason of\nthis, that the doubts of my mind may be removed? Sutbhama replied, "O great\nking! after killing Bhomasoor, you will bring away his sixteen thousand one\nhundred damsels, and will consider me as one of them. This is the reason of my\nhaving been displeased." Shree Krishnu Chund said, "Do not allow yourself to\nsuffer anxiety on any account. I will bring the tree Kulpu, and place it in\nyour house. And do you make a present of it, and also of me to Narud, the\nsage. Having afterwards purchased me again, keep me near you, I will always be\nsubservient to you. In this manner, Indranee made a present of Indru, together\nwith the tree; and Aditee also made a present of Kusyp. If you bestow this\ngift, no wife of mine will be equal to you."\n\nDiscoursing, O great king! in this manner, Shree Krishnu arrived at\nPragojotikpore; there beholding a hill fort, protected by fire, water and air,\nKrishnu gave the order to the sovereign of the feathered race, and to the\nquoit, Soodursun, who, by levelling, making smooth, lopping away and fixing,\n\np. 274\n\nmade a good road in a second. When Huri, advancing, was about to enter the\ncity, the demons, who were guarding the fort, came out to fight; Krishnu\neasily killed and overthrew them with a club. On hearing the news of their\ndeath, a devil, named Moor, with five heads, who was sentinel over the city\nand fort, was greatly enraged, and made an attack upon Shree Krishnu with a\ntrident in his hand, and his eyes red with fury, and gnashing his teeth, began\nto say, "Who, in the world, is more powerful than me? I should like to see him\nhere." With these words, O great king! the devil, Moor, rushed at Shree\nKrishnu Chund, as the king of the feathered race would rush upon a snake. He\nthen aimed blows with the trident, which Krishnu parried with a quoit. As many\nweapons as Moor, in his rage, made use of, and discharged against, Huri, he,\nwith the greatest ease, warded off. He then ran and threw himself upon\nKrishnu, in a state of great confusion, and began to wrestle; when the fight\nhad lasted some time, Shree Krishnu, perceiving that Sutbhama was alarmed, cut\noff his five heads with the quoit, Soodursun. Bhomasoor, having heard the\nsound of the heads falling from the body, enquired, "What very loud noise was\nthat?" Some one came and informed him that Shree Krishnu had killed the devil,\nMoor. Bhomasoor was very sorrowful on first hearing this account; but\nafterwards gave the order to his commander-in-chief to fight. He arranged his\nforces, and stood ready for battle at the gate of the fort. After this, the\nseven sons of Moor, who were very potent and mighty warriors, hearing of their\nfather\'s death, came to fight with, and encounter, Krishnu, armed with weapons\nof all kinds. Bhomasoor, after a while, sent a message to his commander-in-\nchief, and the sons of Moor to fight cautiously, as he was also coming. On\nreceiving the order to fight, the commander-in-chief of Bhomasoor and the sons\nof Moor, accompanied by their armies of evil spirits, came forth to fight with\nShree Krishnu Jee; and all at once, their troops spread like clouds in every\ndirection\n\np. 275\n\nround Krishnu. The warriors of Bhomasoor began to shower from all sides\nmissiles of every description, and to make use of all kinds of arms against\nShree Krishnu Chund; which he, parrying with ease, collected in heaps. At\nlength Huri perceiving that Sutbhama was greatly disquieted, cut in pieces, in\na second, with the quoit, Soodursun, the whole army of demons, together with\nthe seven sons of Moor; just as a husbandman would cut a field of " _jowar_."\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja Pureechit,--O great king! on hearing of the destruction of all his army,\nand of the sons of Moor, Bhomasoor was at first very thoughtful, and\nperplexed. On subsequent reflection, he recovered his confidence; and taking\nseveral very powerful demons with him, his eyes inflamed with rage, tightening\nhis waist belt, preparing his arrows, talking foolishly, he got ready to fight\nwith Shree Krishnu Jee. Bhomasoor was exceedingly wroth when he saw Shree\nKrishnu; and, seizing arrows by the handful, began to discharge them. Huri cut\nthem into three pieces. Then Bhomasoor drew a sword, and howled angrily at\nKrishnu; he sent forth a sound like thunder, exclaiming, "You shall not escape\nfrom me now, you villager." Having spoken these harsh words, Bhomasoor engaged\nin a fierce encounter.\n\nHe, O great king! attacked violently with a club; and his blows made as much\nimpression on the body of Shree Krishnu, as a stick of flowers would make on\nthe body of an elephant. He fought with Krishnu with weapons of all kinds,\nwhich Huri cut in pieces. Bhomasoor then returned to his house, and brought\nforth a trident; and prepared for an encounter. Then Sutbhama called out,\n"When will the lord of the Judoos kill him?" On hearing these words, Krishnu\npoised his quoit, and killed Bhomasoor by cutting off his head. His head fell,\ntogether with the ear-rings and crown. The snake, on which the world rests,\ntrembled when the body fell. There was joy in the three worlds; and the cares\nand miseries of all were\n\np. 276\n\nremoved. His splendour went into the body of Huri. Gods and wise men raised\nshouts of victory. They rained down flowers from their chariots, which were\nassembled together. The gods singing praises to the Vedas, celebrated the\nexploits of Krishnu.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said,--O\ngreat king! on hearing of Bhomasoor\'s death, the earth and Bhomasoor\'s wife\nwith her son came to Krishnu; and standing in his presence, with joined hands\nand bended heads, began to say, in a most supplicating manner, "O luminous\nform of Bruhmu! Beharee, thou friend of thy worshippers, for the sake of holy\nand virtuous men, thou assumest numberless shapes; your greatness, exploits\nand delusive power are boundless, who can understand them, and who has power\nto explain them without your favour? You are the god of all the gods; no one\nunderstands your nature."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, and placed the canopy and ear-rings before\nKrishnu, the earth again said, "O lord of the poor and sea of compassion! this\nson of Bhomasoor, Soobhugdunt, has come to you for protection. Take compassion\non him, and be pleased to place your soft, lotus-like hand on his head, and\ngrant that he may be free from all dread of you."\n\nOn hearing these words, the abode of mercy, Shree Krishnu, compassionately\nplaced his hand on Soobhugdunt\'s head, and caused him to be free from all fear\nof him. Then Bhogawuttee, the wife of Bhomasoor, having brought many gifts to\nHuri, standing before him with joined hands, and bowing her head, said with\nthe greatest humility, "O kind to the poor compassionate being, as you have\nfulfilled all our desires by showing yourself to us, be pleased now to make\nour houses pure by going to them."\n\nOn hearing this request, Shree Moorari, acquainted with the secrets of the\nheart, the friend of his worshippers, went to the\n\np. 277\n\nhouse of Bhomasoor. The mother and sons, having spread silken cloths for\nKrishnu to walk upon; and having accompanied him into the house, seated him\nupon a throne; and having given him an oblation with eight ingredients, and\ntaken the water with which his feet had been washed, said, with the greatest\nsubmissiveness, "O lord of the three worlds! you have done well, in having\ndestroyed this great demon; who that has done acts of enmity towards Krishnu,\nhas ever obtained happiness in the world? Rawun, Kanbhkurun, Kuns and others,\nwho were your enemies, have lost their lives; and whatsoever persons have\nborne malice toward you, have none in the world to perform the commonest\noffices for them." Bhomawutee proceeded to say, "O lord! listen to my\nsupplication; and, looking upon Soobhugdunt as your servant, be pleased to\nmarry the sixteen thousand one hundred young unmarried daughters of Rajas,\nwhom his father kept confined."\n\nHaving thus spoken, she, O great king! brought out all the young daughters of\nRajas into the presence of Krishnu, and arranged them in rows. On seeing the\nlight of the world, the sea of beauty, Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy,\nthey were fascinated; and imploring him earnestly, and with expressions of\ndeep grief, they said, joining their hands, "O lord! as you have come and\nreleased us, poor, weak creatures, from the bonds of this great affliction, be\npleased now to show us favour, and take us with you, and permit us, your\nservants, to attend upon you."\n\nOn hearing this petition, Shree Krishnu Chund said to them, "I will procure\nruths and palkees to convey you hence;" and looked at Soobhugdunt.\nSoobhugdunt, understanding the thoughts of Krishnu\'s mind, went to the seat of\nhis empire, and brought back with him elephants and horses fully equipped,\ncarriages with four wheels, and shining, glittering ruths, and all sorts of\nsplendid palkees. On seeing them, Huri gave orders to all the Rajas\' daughters\nto get into them. He took\n\np. 278\n\n[paragraph continues] Soobhugdunt with him to the royal palace; and having\nseated him on the throne, made the royal marks on his forehead with his own\nhand, and took leave. The splendour of the scene, in the course of his journey\nwith the Rajas\' daughters thence to Dwarka cannot be described. The splendour\nof the elephants and horses the glitter of the white and black trappings, and\nthe brilliancy of the iron armour of the horses, the beauty of the coverings\nof the chariots, wheeled carriages and palkees and the lustre of their fringes\nof pearls, shone forth, equalling the sun in brightness.\n\nShree Krishnu Chund arrived, after a few days\' journey, with the Rajas\'\ndaughters, at Dwarka. On arrival there, he placed them in the royal palace,\nand having gone to the Raja Oogursen, and made a salutation, Shree Krishnu\nrelated all the circumstances of his slaying Bhomasoor, and releasing and\nbringing away the Rajas\' daughters. Then taking leave of the Raja, Krishnu,\naccompanied by Sutbhama, and taking the canopy and ear-rings with him, seated\non the sovereign of the feathered race, went to the paradise of Vishnu. On\narrival there, he gave the ear-rings to the husband of Aditee, and placed the\ncanopy over the head of the lord of the gods.\n\nHaving received intelligence of this event, Narud came there, to whom Huri\nsaid, "Go and tell Indru, that Sutbhama asks for the tree Kulpu from him, let\nus see what he will say, and bring his answer back to me, I will form my plans\nafter receipt of his reply."\n\nNarud Jee, O great king! having heard this request of Shree Krishnu Chund,\nwent to the lord of the gods, and said, "Sutbhama, your brother\'s wife,\nsolicits from you the tree Kulpu. Tell me what answer I am to take back from\nyou to this [request](errata.htm#14)." When Indru had heard what Narud said,\nhe was at first confused and thoughtful; and afterwards went and mentioned to\nIndranee all that Narud, the sage, had said. Indranee, on hearing the account,\nwas angry, and said, Your dulness of intellect, O lord of the gods! will never\nleave\n\np. 279\n\nyou. You are a great fool, O blind husband! Who is Krishnu, and whose brother\nis he? Do you remember or not, that in Bruj he abolished the adoration of you,\nand caused the inhabitants to worship a hill, and deceitfully ate the\nsweetmeats, which had been prepared for your poojah? Again, having caused you\nto pour down rain on the hill, for seven days, he lowered your pride, and\ndishonoured you throughout the world. Are you not ashamed of this? He respects\nwhat his wife says. Why do you not listen to my suggestions?"\n\nWhen Indranee, O great king! had thus addressed Indru, he was annoyed; and\nreturned to Narud Jee and said, "O chief of the sages! go and say to Shree\nKrishnu Chund from me, that the tree Kulpu shall never leave the forest of\nNundun to go elsewhere; nor shall it remain any where else. Explain also to\nhim, that there will be a great battle between us if he should injure me as he\ndid formerly; when having misled the inhabitants of Bruj, and pretending to\nworship a hill, he ate up all the sweatmeats and other confections, which had\nbeen collected for my worship."\n\nNarud Jee, on hearing these words, returned to Shree Krishnu Chund, and having\nrepeated Indru\'s speech, said, "O great king! Indru would have given the tree\nKulpu; but his wife would not let him." On hearing these words, Shree Moorari,\nthe destroyer of pride, went into the forest of Nundun; and having slain, and\nput to flight the keepers, carried off the tree Kulpu, and brought it away\nwith him on the bird, which is the vehicle of Vishnu. The keepers who had been\nwounded by Krishnu and fled, went to Indru and called out, mentioning what had\nhappened.\n\nO great king! Raja Indru was greatly enraged, when he received intelligence of\nthe tree Kulpu having been carried off; and taking thunderbolts in his hand,\nand summoning all the gods, he mounted the elephant Yerawut, and prepared for\nbattle with Shree Krishnu Chund. Narud, the sage,\n\np. 280\n\nhaving come again to Indru, said, "Raja! you are very foolish in preparing to\ncontend with Bhugwan at the instigation of your wife. Are you not ashamed of\nhaving said what you did? If you intended fighting, why did you not do so,\nwhen Bhomasoor carried off your canopy and the ear-rings of Aditee? Now that\nKrishnu has slain Bhomasoor, and restored the canopy and ear-rings, you are\npreparing to fight with him. Why did you not fight with Bhomasoor, if you are\nso powerful? Have you forgotten that day, on which you went to Krishnu at\nBruj, and asked forgiveness of your fault with the greatest humility, and\nobtained it? And do you now proceed to fight with him again?"\n\nO great king! on hearing this speech of Narud Jee\'s, Indru regretted and was\nashamed, and repented having made preparations for battle. When Shree Krishnu\nChund reached Dwarka, all the Judoos were highly delighted at seeing him.\nKrishnu took the tree Kulpu and placed it in Sutbhama\'s palace; and the Raja\nOogursen gave the sixteen thousand one hundred unmarried daughters of Rajas in\nmarriage to Shree Krishnu Chund, in the manner prescribed by the Vedas, There\nwere festive rejoicings according to the prescribed injunctions of the Vedas;\nthus did Krishnu enjoy himself in the world. Huri showed great affection for\nthe sixteen thousand one hundred daughters of Rajas; and had an unceasing love\nfor his eight queens. Having narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo\nJee said, Raja! thus did Huri slay Bhomasoor, and restore the ear-rings of\nAditee and the canopy of Indru. Then having contracted sixteen thousand one\nhundred and eight marriages, Shree Krishnu Chund brought all his wives to\nDwarka and began joyfully to indulge in sports and diversions.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXI](psa62.htm)\n\n'
