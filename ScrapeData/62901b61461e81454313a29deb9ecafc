Otherwise (if no manas existed) there would result either constant\nperception or constant non-perception, or else a limitation of either of the\ntwo (i.e. of the soul or of the senses).\n\nThe internal organ which constitutes the limiting adjunct of the soul is\ncalled in different places by different names, such as manas (mind), buddhi\n(intelligence), vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana (knowledge), _k_ itta (thought). This\ndifference of nomenclature is sometimes made dependent on the difference of\nthe modifications of the internal organ which is called manas when it is in\nthe state of doubt, &c., buddhi when it is in the state of determination and\nthe like.--Now we must necessarily acknowledge the existence of such an\ninternal organ; because otherwise there would result either perpetual\nperception or perpetual non-perception. There would result perpetual\nperception whenever there is a conjunction of the soul, the senses and the\nobjects of sense--the three together constituting the instruments of\nperception; or else, if on the conjunction of the three causes the effect did\nnot follow, there would take place perpetual non-perception. But neither of\nthese two alternatives is actually observed.--Or else we should have to assume\nthat there are obstacles in the way of the energy either of the Self or the\nsense-organs. But the former is not possible, as the\n\np. 49\n\n[paragraph continues] Self is not capable of any modification; nor the latter,\nas we cannot assume that the energy of the sense-organ which is non-obstructed\nin the preceding and the following moment should, without any cause, be\nobstructed (in the intervening moment). Hence we have to acknowledge the\nexistence of an internal organ through whose attention and non-attention\nperception and non-perception take place. Thus scripture declares, 'My mind\nwas elsewhere, I did not see; my mind was elsewhere, I did not hear; for a man\nsees with his mind and hears with his mind' (B _ri_. Up. I, 5, 3). Scripture\nmoreover shows that desire and similar states are modifications of the mind,\n'Desire, representation, doubt, faith, want of faith, memory, forgetfulness,\nshame, reflection, fear, all this is mind.' The explanation given in Sutra 29\nis therefore an appropriate one.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 33](sbe38034.htm)\n\n"
