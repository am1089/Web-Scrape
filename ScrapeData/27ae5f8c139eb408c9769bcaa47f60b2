(Brahman is) not (the cause); on account of (the world) having the nature\nof what depends on a motive.\n\nAlthough the Lord, who before creation is alone, is endowed with all kinds of\npowers since he differs in nature\n\np. 477\n\nfrom all other beings, and hence is by himself capable of creating the world;\nwe all the same cannot ascribe to him actual causality with regard to the\nworld; for this manifold world displays the nature of a thing depending on a\nmotive, and the Lord has no motive to urge him to creation. In the case of all\nthose who enter on some activity after having formed an idea of the effect to\nbe accomplished, there exists a motive in the form of something beneficial\neither to themselves or to others. Now Brahman, to whose essential nature it\nbelongs that all his wishes are eternally fulfilled, does not attain through\nthe creation of the world any object not attained before. Nor again is the\nsecond alternative possible. For a being, all whose wishes are fulfilled,\ncould concern itself about others only with a view to benefitting them. No\nmerciful divinity would create a world so full, as ours is, of evils of all\nkind--birth, old age, death, hell, and so on;--if it created at all, pity\nwould move it to create a world altogether happy. Brahman thus having no\npossible motive cannot be the cause of the world.--This prima facie view is\ndisposed of in the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 33.
