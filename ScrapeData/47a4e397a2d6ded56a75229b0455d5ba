Suta said :-- O Ri _s_ is! Thus advising, the Devar _s_ i, the great\nJ\xc3\xb1ani and Muni going wherever he likes, went to the Brahmaloka. After the Muni\nhad gone, the Bindhya became immersed in great anxiety and becoming always\nvery sorrowful, could not get peace. What shall I do now so as to overthrow\nMeru? Until I do that, I won't be able to get the peace of my mind or my\nhealth. The highsouled persons always praised me for my enthusiasm and energy.\nFie to my energy, honour, fame and family! Fie to my strength and heroism! O\nRi _s_ is! With all these cogitations in his mind, Bindhya came finally to\nthis crooked conclusion :-- \xc2\x93Daily the Sun, stars and planets circumambulate\nround the Sumeru; hence Sumeru is always so arrogant; now if I can resist the\nSun's course in the heavens by my peaks, He will not be able to circumambulate\nround the Sumeru. If I can do this, certainly I will be able to curb the\nSumeru in his pride.\xc2\x94 Thus coming to a conclusion, Bindhya raised his arms\nthat were the peaks high up to the heavens and blocking the passage in the\nHeavens, remained so and passed that night with great uneasiness and\ndifficulty, thinking when the Sun would rise and he would obstruct His\npassage. At last, when the morning broke out, all the quarters were clear. The\nSun, destroying the darkness, rose in Udaya Giri. The sky looked clear with\nHis rays; the lotus, seeing Him, blew out with joy; while the excellent white\nwater-lilies, at the bereavement of the Moon, contracted their leaves and\nclosed as if at the separation of one's lover, gone to a distant place. The\npeople began to do their own works on the appearance of the day; the worship\nof the gods, the offerings to the Gods,\n\n\n\np. 1026\n\n\n\nthe Homas and the offerings to the Pitris were set a going on (in the morning,\nafternoon and evening respectively). The Sun marched on in His course. He\ndivided the day into three parts, morning, midday, and afternoon. First of all\nhe consoled the eastern quarter which seemed like a woman suffering from the\nbereavement of her lover; then he consoled the south eartern corner; then as\nHe wanted to go quickly towards the south, His horses could not go further.\nThe charioteer Aru _n_ a, seeing this, informed the Sun what had happened.\n\n\n\n17\\. Aru _n_ a spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Sun! The Bindhya has become very jealous of the\nSumeru as You circumambulate round the Sumeru Mountain daily. He has risen\nvery high and obstructed your course in the Heavens, hoping that you would\ncircumambulate round him. He is thus vying with the Sumeru Mountain.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n18-26. Suta said :-- O Ri _s_ is! Hearing the words of Aru _n_ a, the\ncharioteer, the Sun began to think thus :-- \xc2\x93Oh! The Bindhya is going to\nobstruct My course! What can a great hero not do, when he is in the wrong\npath? Oh! My horses' motions are stopped to-day! The fate is the strongest of\nall (Because Bindhya is strong today by Daiva, therefore he is doing this).\nEven when eclipsed by Rahu (the ascending node) I do not stop for a moment\neven; and now obstructed in My passage, I am waiting here for a long time. The\nDaiva is powerful; what can I do?\xc2\x94 The Sun's course having been thus\nobstructed, all from the Gods to the lowest became helpless and could not make\nout what to do. Chitragupta and others ascertain their time through the Sun's\ncourse; and that Sun is now rendered motionless by the Bindhya mountain! What\na great adverse fate is this! When the Sun was thus obstructed by the Bindhya\nout of his arrogance, the sacrifices to the Devas, the offerings to the Pitris\nall were stopped; the world was going to rack and ruin. The people that lived\non the west and south had their nights prolonged and they remained asleep. The\npeople of the east and the north were scorched by the strong rays of the Sun\nand some of them died; some of them lost their health and so forth. The whole\nearth became devoid of S'raddhas and worships and a cry of universal distress\narose on all sides. Indra and the other Devas became very anxious and began to\nthink what they should do at that moment.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Third Chapter of the Tenth Book on the obstruction of the Sun's\ncourse by the Bindhya Mountain in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 4](bk10ch04.htm)\n\n"
