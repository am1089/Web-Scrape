But if the ancient glory has vanished, a new and greater has come in\nits stead. The quaint old town is to-day the centre of some of the chief art\nindustries of the world, and among other things, it is the home of the Kashmir\nShawl. The Tartars brought the art of shawl-weaving into the country about\nfour or five centuries ago; then it came under the stimulating influence of\nIndian taste, and developed rapidly from a domestic handicraft into a fine\nart. To this day the goats\' wool which it requires is brought from Yarkand to\nSrinagar, and only the young fleece of the first year is considered fine\nenough for use.\n\nThree brains combine to produce this work of art. First comes the designer,\nwho receives a couple of shillings for his trouble; next the copier, who\nprepares the pattern for use in the workshop, and last of all the weaver. Of\nthese, the second is regarded as most skilled and receives five times\n\np. 151\n\nthe remuneration bestowed on the original artist. To us this seems a pity.\nThat a genius should be regarded as a mere workman, lost in the crowd of\nmediocrity, is shocking to us. Besides, we lose thereby all that charm of\npersonality that clings to a toy-book by Hokusai, for instance, or a bit of\nmodelling by the Della Robbias. But there is much to be said on behalf of a\ncertain custom that withdraws all the degrading if stimulating influence of\nFame, and leaves to the worker only that highest compelling power of the\nartistic conscience. Such conditions pass all too quickly. They belong to the\ngreat age of Faith all over the earth, and with their decay comes loss of\npurity and tension to all save the noblest souls. Besides, as a matter of\nskill the gradation is not so absurd after all, for the taste is not mere\ntransference of line and tint, but the translation of those into musical\nscore.\n\nThe weaver actually possesses no copy of the design except in this notation.\nThe manuscript of a melody lies in front of him, and from this he weaves the\npattern that we see. A Kashmiri loom is really a little orchestra, and each\nshawl a symphony of colours, the men as they work chanting the stitches in\nmonotonous plain-song. The connection between colour and sound is fundamental\nin Indian art-fabrics--though the point has never been investigated so far as\nwe know--\n\np. 152\n\nand furnishes the key to that power of combining and harmonising in which they\nare supreme.\n\nIt is to these copyists that experts must look for the restoration of the old\npatterns which cannot at present be repeated. It is by them, too, that the\nmaterial will be produced which must eventually be brought together to form a\nnational museum. At present there are no records kept of these marvellous\ndecorative schemes, and no collections save those made by dealers in the\ninterest of their trade. Even then, however, there is abundant opportunity for\nstudying the progress of the art, and no chance of escaping its spell.\n\nComparing the shawls of two hundred years ago with those of to-day, we find in\nthe modern specimens a greater boldness and freedom of outline, with a growing\npower of colour-combination. From purely geometrical means there is distinct\nmovement towards conventionalising vegetal forms--the monotonous curves (a\nlocal variation of the Indian pine-pattern) and circles giving place in great\nmeasure to trailing tendrils and spiral ornaments. The Moslem faith forbids\nany imitation of animal forms: hence we find none of the beautiful birds of\nKashmir, the hoopoe, the bulbul, or the blue kingfisher, amongst these\nflowers. With regard to colour, the development of power has been\nextraordinary. A few of the old shawls are incomparably fine, but on the whole\nthe\n\np. 153\n\nnumber of shades used in masterpieces was far smaller than those commonly\nmanipulated now. The achievements of William Morris in this line give some\nidea to the English mind of the kind of text employed. But the cretonnes and\ntapestries of Merton are coarse and almost clumsy compared with these\nexquisite stuffs.\n\nIndian taste demands three things of the decorator: fineness of detail,\nbrilliance of effect, and profuseness. This is natural in a climate which\nproduces the beautiful in splendid masses without relief or pause. It is the\nflower-jewelled villages of Kashmir that are reflected in the national\nindustries, just as it was the luxuriance of the jungle that trained hands and\neyes to build the Taj and perforate the marble at Ahmedabad.\n\nIt is worth while to remember that the selfsame cause which gives its dazzling\nbeauty to Oriental ornament makes Western art a fine vehicle for the\nimpression of ideas. Our walls are ugly, yet we have fine sculptures, a\nRaphael, and a Rossetti. We have no gorgeous palaces maybe, but what of our\ngrey cathedrals? The world would be as much poorer for the loss of an old\nEnglish village church as by the further destruction of the rose-red walls of\nDelhi; but on the other hand we must not forget that the porcelains of China\nand the mosaics of Agra are just as essential to the whole as the ruined\ncloisters of Europe or the regal\n\np. 154\n\narchitecture of Westminster and Versailles. The great rhythm of Time and Space\nin which the Indian mind so delights finds once more an illustration here. Not\nin the Good alone, but also in the Evil, in Death as well as Life, in the West\nand in the East, in diversity of all kinds, is to be read the revelation of\nUnity. From all points do the paths converge by which the One comes to the\nvision of man.\n\nShawl-making, then, is to-day a living industry in this Central Asian valley\nof its birth, but we cannot deny that the modern craftsman works under\ncorrupting influences unknown to his forefathers. The last twenty years have\nopened up the beautiful vale to European intercourse, and the disastrous\neffects of fashion and semi-education are as apparent here as in the ancient\narts of woodcarving and _papier-mach e_. If the Kashmir weaver is to be saved\nat all from denationalised vulgarity, it can only be by a close and\nsympathetic study of the old masterpieces, and by the careful enlightenment of\nWestern taste.\n\nThe fall of the last French Empire dealt a deathblow to the use of the shawl,\nfrom which it will probably never recover; but the recognition of these\nexquisite garments as tapestries and furniture draperies is inevitable with\nthe advance of knowledge and discrimination amongst us. This is bound to\nsupersede the square outline by the\n\np. 155\n\npanel and other forms, and may, it is much to be feared, have many less\nsalutary consequences. Hence it is important that such losses should be\nbalanced by still greater gains of freedom, originality, and bewildering\nloveliness--and, as all will agree, these must be in the spirit of the old\nwork, to the exclusion of incongruous elements, if they are to signify\ndevelopment and not deterioration.\n\nThis fine industry has a primitive air all through. The pedlar is the great\nagent of dissemination, and in dealing with him the process of bartering needs\nto be treated as a science. In his own fastnesses, down in the bazaar, the\nunwary buyer is at a grave disadvantage, for tea is served in dainty old\nchina, and all the honeyed resources of Oriental courtesy are exhausted to\nmake the obligation more complete. So in Cairo, sitting in the shop-sill\ndrinking coffee out of egg cups, it costs the whole afternoon to spend ten\nshillings.\n\nBut if the ramifications of the trade strike us as quaint in their simplicity,\nwhat shall we think of those little factories in which the manufacture is\ncarried on?\n\nIn a tiny mud-built cottage, baked silver-grey by the sun\'s heat--one of a\nnumber surrounding the irregular farmyard-square that to the Indian mind\nrepresents the slum--in an upper room which also contains a bed, we may find\nthree looms, set at right angles to the windows, and\n\np. 156\n\ngiving space altogether to nine workers. Their monotonous weavers\' chant\nceases as we enter and fingers fall idle, that we may be free to examine the\nmachines at our pleasure. These long low frames are comparatively small, and\nstretched across from back to front lie the close tight strands of the warp.\nSuch a work as it is! Long delicate threads of creamy white or glistening\ngrey, or some wonderful shade of green or rose or blue. It is the hair of\nyoung goats, in its first downy softness, spun almost to the thinness of\nspider silk.\n\nEqually fine are more coloured wools--wound on little spindles instead of\nreels--which the men take up and with incredible swiftness (reading the\nmanuscript before them with their voices and _listening_ to the pattern with\ntheir fingers, as it were) pass in and out, over and under, through the\nbackground, counting as they work. And so without gleam of shuttles or noise\nof machinery, line upon line, stitch after stitch, by the patient labour of\nhuman fingers grows the web of the Kashmir shawl. Overhead hangs a row of\nbrilliantly-dyed skeins of yarn. It is the gamut of colours in which the\ndesign is pitched and deepens the analogy to the symphony in music. Now, as\nthe men yield once more to that abstracting power which all needlework, and\nspecially all darning, possesses, breaking out into a louder strain, we\nrealise afresh that this relationship of sound which\n\np. 157\n\nthe ear appreciates so easily is identical with that which appeals only to the\neye. We are reading our pattern through two senses at once.\n\nTruly this is a craft of olden times. Witness the fact that every one of the\nprocesses may be carried on under the same roof. Down yonder in the courtyard,\nin the shadow of the thick wall, sit three women who, in their statuesque\nKashmiri beauty, might be the Greek Fates--in the middle the grandmother, with\nher spinning-wheel, and beside her two daughters-in-law, pulling and twisting\nthe yet untinted fleece. The quiet dignity of age surrounds the old Moslem\nwoman. The face under the veil and coronet is as of one who has loved and\nsuffered and triumphed like a queen. Ask her her faith, and note the ring in\nher voice as she answers proudly: "Praise be to God! Thanks to the mercy of\nthe Lord, I am a Mussulman!" "The mercy of the Lord" and the banner that we\nassociate with sword and slaughter!\n\nBut the children play on unheeding in the sunshine, the wheel turns merrily,\nand through the open window above us floats the song of the men at their\nweaving. It is indeed a note from a far past age, and as we stand, looking and\nlistening, we think we hear those words from an Eastern book, "Man\'s days are\nswifter than a weaver\'s shuttle."\n\nBut yesterday, the Tartars entered Srinagar,\n\np. 158\n\nto-day the English are here, and to-morrow they will be gone, leaving an old\nold race to dream once more the sweet dreams of labour and poetry and beauty,\ntill--as they themselves would phrase their hope--the net of Maya shall be\nbroken and they be lost in the ocean of the Beatific Vision.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Land of the Water-Ways](seh26.htm)\n\n'
