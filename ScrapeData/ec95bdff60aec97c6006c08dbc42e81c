Now the Gatakarman (i.e. ceremony for the new-born child).\n\np. 50\n\n2 2. Let (the father) breathe three times on the new-born child and then draw\nin his breath with the words, \'Draw in your breath with the _Ri_ _k_ , breathe\nwithin with the Ya _g_ us, breathe forth with the Saman.\'\n\n3\\. Let him mix together butter and honey, milk curds and water, or grind\ntogether rice and barley, and give it to eat (to the child) thrice from gold\n(i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon),\n\n4\\. With (the verse), \'I administer to thee honey food for the festival, the\nwisdom ("veda") raised by Savitar the bountiful; long-living, protected by the\ngods, live a hundred autumns in this world, N.N.!\'(with these words) he gives\nhim a name beginning with a sonant, with a semivowel in it, consisting of two\nsyllables, or of four syllables, or also of six syllables; he should take a k\n_ri_ t (suffix), not a taddhita.\n\n5\\. That (name only) his father and his mother should know.\n\n6\\. On the tenth day a name for common use, which is pleasing to the Brahma\n_n_ as.\n\n7\\. Let him pulverise black and white and red hairs of a black ox, intermix\n(that powder) with those four substances (see Sutra 3), and give it to eat (to\nthe child) four times: such (is the opinion of) Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya.\n\np. 51\n\n8 8. If he likes (let him do so) with the words, \'Bhu _h_! The Rig-veda I lay\ninto thee, N.N., svaha!\n\n\'Bhuva _h_! The Ya _g_ ur-veda I lay into thee, N.N., svaha!\n\n\'Sva _h_! The Sama-veda I lay into thee, N.N., svaha!\n\n\'Bhur bhuva _h_ sva _h_! Vakovakya (colloquies), Itihasa, and Pura _n_ a\xc2\x97Om!\nAll the Vedas I lay into thee, N.N., svaha!\'\n\n9\\. The production of intelligence (is performed) by thrice saying in his\nright ear, \'Speech!\'\n\n10\\. And let him recite over (the child the following text), \'Speech, the\ngoddess, united with mind, together with breath, the child, uttered by\nIndra\xc2\x97may she rejoice in thee, the goddess, for the sake of joy, the great\none, the sweet sounding, the music, full of music, the flowing, self-\nproduced.\'\n\n11\\. Let him tie a piece of gold to a hempen string,\n\n12 12. And bind it to (the child\'s) right hand until (the mother) gets up\n(from childbed).\n\n13\\. After the tenth day let him give it to the Brahma _n_ as,\n\n14\\. Or keep it himself.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[49:1](sbe29026.htm#fr_105) 24, 1. Comp. Dr. Speijer\'s essay on the _G_\natakarman (Leiden, 1872). Naraya _n_ a observes that, as it is prescribed\nbelow (chap. 25, 4) that a mess of food is to be cooked in the sutikagni, here\nthe sutikagni is established, and sacrifice is performed therein. The Sutra I,\n25, 4, from which it is to be inferred that the sutikagni should be kept, is\nconsidered, accordingly, as a _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ apaka (see Professor Buhler\'s notes on\n\xc3\x82pastamba I, II, 7; Gautama p. 50 I, 31; Naraya _n_ a\'s note on chap. 25, 4,\np. 133 of the German edition).\n\n[50:2](sbe29026.htm#fr_106) Abhyavanya should be corrected into abhyapanya, as\nin IV, 18, 1 nearly all the MSS. read nivata instead of nipata. The _S_\nambavya MS. reads in the text, trir abhyanyanupra _n_ ya; in the commentary\ntrir a _n_ yapa _n_ yanupra _n_ ya. Comp., on the terminology of the different\nvital airs, Speijer, _G_ atakarma, p. 64 seq.; Eggeling, S.B.E., vol. xii, p.\n20.\n\n[51:8](sbe29026.htm#fr_107) Veti vikalparthe. bhur _ri_ gvedam ityadi _k_\naturbhir mantrair asav ity atra purveva (read purvavat?) kumaranamagraha _n_\napurvaka _m_ kumara _m_ pra _s_ ayet.
