It would be very unbecoming in any one engaged in the study\nof G _ri_ hya texts, not to acknowledge most warmly the debt of gratitude\nwhich he owes to Professor Stenzler. At the same time the respect due to the\nveteran editor and interpreter of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana and Paraskara not only\nallows, but requires that one who proposes to himself the same task at which\nProf. Stenzler has worked with so much learning, should state as clearly as\npossible what that distinguished scholar has left for others to do, and why\none who prepares an English translation of Paraskara has a very different task\nfrom merely translating into English the German translation of Prof. Stenzler.\n\nIf I may venture to express in one word the difference between Prof.\nStenzler's method, as I understand it, for getting at the meaning of a\ndoubtful or obscure passage, and the method which I have endeavoured to\nfollow, I should say that with Prof. Stenzler the first step and,\n\np. 264\n\n[paragraph continues] I believe, in many cases also the last step is to ask\nhow _G_ ayarama and Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a understand the passage in question,\nwhile I hold that we ought rather to make ourselves independent from those\ncommentators in the sense in which Prof. Max Muller once expressed himself 1,\n'not that I ever despise the traditional interpretation which the commentators\nhave preserved to us, but because I think that, after having examined it, we\nhave a right to judge for ourselves.' There exists a commentary on the\nParaskara-G _ri_ hya which far surpasses in trustworthiness _G_ ayarama's Sa\n_g_ _g_ anavallabha and Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a's Sa _m_ skaraga _n_ apati, and\nwhich is not composed by an author who, as says Goethe,\n\n     \xc2\x97im Auslegen ist munter;  \nLegt er nicht aus, so legt er unter.\n\n[paragraph continues] But the leaves of that commentary are scattered through\na good many volumes. Here we find a few lines of it in the _S_ atapatha Brahma\n_n_ a or in Katyayana's _S_ rauta-sutra; there _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana or \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana\nhas preserved a word or a sentence that belongs to it; or the law-books of\nManu or Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya help us to understand a difficult or doubtful\naphorism of our text. In one word: the only true commentary on a work like\nParaskara's G _ri_ hya is that which the ancient literature itself furnishes.\nNo one will say that in Prof. Stenzler's translation and notes this commentary\nhas not been consulted. But it has been consulted perhaps not quite as much as\nit ought to have been, and Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a and _G_ ayarama have been\nconsulted too much. They have been consulted and followed in many instances,\nwhere a continued consideration of what can be the meaning of a word and what\ncan not, and of what the parallel texts say with regard to the subject in\nquestion, would have shown that those commentators, instead of interpreting\nParaskara's meaning, father on him vague opinions of their own.\n\nPerhaps it will not be out of place here to point our\n\np. 265\n\ncriticism, lest it should be deemed unjust, by a few remarks on a single\npassage of Paraskara in which the difference of Prof. Stenzler's way of\ntranslating and of our own becomes manifest. Of the numerous passages which\ncould be selected for this purpose, I choose Sutra I, 2, 5, belonging to the\ndescription of the setting up of the sacred domestic fire. The text of that\nSutra runs thus:\n\n5\\. ara _n_ ipradunam eke.\n\nProf. Stenzler translates as follows:\n\n'Einige sagen, es musse durch Reibholzer erzeugtes Feuer sein.'\n\nThe two Sutras which precede give a description of that ceremony from which\nevidently the opinion of the 'eke' mentioned in this Sutra differs, or to\nwhich they find it necessary to add something. Those Sutras run thus:\n\n3\\. After he has fetched fire from the house of a Vai _s_ ya who is rich in\ncattle\xc2\x97\n\n4\\. All ceremonies are performed as at the cooking of the _k_ atushpra _s_ ya\nfood 1.\n\nIt seems evident that the \xc3\x82 _k_ aryas to whom the opinion spoken of in Sutra 5\nbelongs, add, or perhaps substitute, to the fetching of the fire which is to\nbe worshipped as the sacrificer's domestic fire, from a rich Vai _s_ ya's\nhouse, another rite in which an ara _n_ i, i.e. a stick for kindling the fire\nby attrition, is made use of in some way or other.\n\nNow if this may be accepted as a vague expression of the general purport of\nthe Sutra, what is the literal meaning of the words? 'Some (teachers),' it\nsays, '(prescribe) the pradana of the kindling stick (or, of the kindling\nsticks).'\n\nWhat does pradana mean? _G_ ayarama says,\n\n'pra _s_ abda upa _s_ abdarthe. ara _n_ yupadanakam eka a _k_ arya i _k_ _kh_\nanti.'\n\np. 266\n\nThat is: 'The word pra stands in the sense of the word upa. Some teachers\ndesire that it (i.e. the fire) should have the kindling sticks as its physical\nbasis 1.'\n\nThus, if _G_ ayarama is right, Prof. Stenzler's translation would be\njustified. But can we acquiesce indeed in simply accepting the commentator's\nopinion? Pradana is pradana and not upadana, as pradadati is not upadatte.\nPradadati means 'he hands over,' and pradana 'the handing over.' This is an\nestablished fact, and an interpreter of a Vedic text should not allow himself\nto be induced by a statement like that of _G_ ayarama about the preposition\npra standing in the sense of upa, to abate one iota of it. Thus we are\nobliged, until passages have been discovered which modify our knowledge of\nwhat pradana means\xc2\x97but such passages most certainly will never be\ndiscovered\xc2\x97to translate:\n\n5\\. Some (teachers say that) the handing over of the kindling sticks (takes\nplace).\n\nWe should give that translation even if we were not able to find an\nexplanation for it. It appears that Prof. Stenzler, as far as we can judge\nfrom his note, has not even thought of the possibility of disregarding the\nauthority of _G_ ayarama and Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, or of looking through the\nparallel texts to see whether they do not throw light on what that 'handing\nover of the kindling sticks' signifies. The text to be consulted first is of\ncourse Katyayana's _S_ rauta-sutra. As the _S_ rauta ritual contains a\ndescription of an adhana which is in some way the prototype of the\ncorresponding G _ri_ hya ceremony, we may possibly expect to discover, in the\ncourse of that description, the statements regarding the ara _n_ i-pradana for\nwhich we are searching. Now Katyayana 2, having described the setting up of\nthe fire in the garhapatyagara, states that at sunset the sacrificer and his\n\np. 267\n\nwife sit down to the west of the fire which has just been established, and\nthen the Adhvaryu hands over to them the two kindling sticks 1. The Paddhati,\nin describing that act, goes into further details. The Adhvaryu hands over to\nthe sacrificer the two Ara _n_ is, which, as required by custom, are wrapped\nup in new clothes. The wife takes the adharara _n_ i from his hand and puts it\non her lap; the sacrificer puts the uttarara _n_ i on his lap, and they do\nhomage to them with flowers, saffron, sandal wood, &c.; then, after the\nperformance of some other ceremonies, they put the two Ara _n_ is away on a\nchair or bench. The two Ara _n_ is have to be kept by the sacrificer; if they\nare lost or burnt or destroyed in any other way, other Ara _n_ is must be\nprocured, and by their attrition a new fire must be kindled 2.\n\n\xc3\x82pastamba likewise mentions, in his description of the Agnyadhana 3, the\nhanding over of the two Ara _n_ is, and indicates a Mantra which the Adhvaryu\nrecites in giving them to the sacrificer, and two other Mantras with the one\nof which the sacrificer receives them, while he recites the other over the Ara\n_n_ is, after having taken them into his hands.\n\nFinally we may quote here, as bearing witness to the custom of the Ara _n_\nipradana, a passage taken from Naraya _n_ a's commentary on the _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya. Though the decisive words in that passage rest only on\nthe authority of the commentator and not of the Sutrakara himself, they\ndeserve to be taken notice of, as they are not subject to the suspicion that\nthey could be influenced by a misunderstanding of that very Sutra of Paraskara\nof which we are treating. Naraya _n_ a says, in his explanation of _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 1, 10 4: 'To the west of the fire the sacrificer, and southwards\n(of him) the wife sits down. The\n\np. 268\n\nhanding over of the kindling sticks does not take place. For it is a fire\nfetched (from a Vai _s_ ya's house, &c.) which is inaugurated here 1.' Then\nthe commentator goes on to quote a _S_ loka:\n\n'The handing over of the Ara _n_ is which the Adhvaryu sometimes performs,\n\n'Is not in accordance with the opinion of Suya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a 2; he does not\napprove of kindling the fire by attrition 3:\n\nThus, I think, no doubt can remain as to the real meaning of Paraskara's\nSutra: it means what its words signify and what is in accordance with\nKatyayana and \xc3\x82pastamba, and it does not mean what the commentators most\ngratuitously would make it mean.\n\nPerhaps I have dwelt here too long on the interpretation of a few words which\nare of no peculiar interest in themselves. But I venture to hope that the\ndiscussion on these words will serve as a specimen, by which the fundamental\ndifference of two methods of handling our texts may be discerned. Let us never\nforget how much we owe to the scholars who have followed the first of these\nmethods, but for ourselves let us choose the second.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[264:1](sbe29154.htm#fr_652) Sacred Books of the East, vol. xv, p. 2, note 2.\n\n[265:1](sbe29154.htm#fr_653) The food which is eaten by the four chief\nofficiating priests of the _S_ rauta ritual.
