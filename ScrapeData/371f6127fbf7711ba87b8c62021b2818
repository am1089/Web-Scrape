To people who are\nunacquainted with the religious state of India, whether modern or ancient, and\nignorant of the systems of philosophy prevalent in what has often, and not\nunjustly, been called a country of philosophers, it is very difficult to\nunderstand these movements, more particularly to distinguish between their\nleaders, who may be open to criticism, and the ideas themselves by which they\nfeel inspired, and which they preach, often with great eloquence, to the\nmultitudes that believe in them and follow them. My article, entitled 'A Real\nMahatman,' appeared in the August number, 1896, of the _Nineteenth Century_ ,\nand gave rise to a good deal of controversy both in India and in England. My\nobject was twofold: I wished to\n\np. 2\n\nprotest against the wild and overcharged accounts of Saints and Sages living\nand teaching at present in India which had been published and scattered\nbroadcast in Indian, American, and English papers, and I wished to show at the\nsame time that behind such strange names as Indian Theosophy, and Esoteric\nBuddhism and all the rest, there was something real, something worth knowing,\nworth knowing even for us, the students of Plato and Aristotle, Kant and\nHegel, in Europe. What happens so often to people whose powers of admiration\nare in excess of their knowledge and discretion, has happened to the admirers\nof certain Hindu sages. They thought they had been the first to discover and\nunearth these Indian Mahatmans, whom they credited not only with a profound\nknowledge of ancient or even primeval wisdom, but with superhuman powers\nexhibited generally in the performance of very silly miracles. Not knowing\nwhat had long been known to every student of Sanskrit philology, they were\ncarried away by the idea that they had found in India quite a new race of\nhuman beings, who had gone through a number of the most fearful ascetic\nexercises, had retired from the world, and had gained great popularity among\nlow and high by their preachings and teachings, by their abstemious life, by\ntheir stirring eloquence, and by the power ascribed to them of working\nmiracles. Mahatman, however, is but one of the many names by which these\npeople have long been known. Mahatman means literally great-souled, then high-\nminded, noble, and all the rest. It is often used simply as a complimentary\nterm, much as we use\n\np. 3\n\nreverend or honourable, but it has also been accepted as a technical term,\napplied to a class of men who in the ancient language of India are well known\nto us by their name of Sa _m_ nyasin. Sa _m_ nyasin means literally one who\nhas laid down or surrendered everything, that is, one who has abandoned all\nworldly affections and desires. 'He is to be known as a Sa _m_ nyasin,' we\nread in the Bhagavad-gita V, 3, 'who does not hate and does not love\nanything.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Four Stages of Life](rls04.htm)\n\n"
