And on account of the statement of reflection (on the part of the Self).\n\nThe fact of the sacred texts declaring that the Self reflected likewise shows\nthat it is the operative as well as the material cause. Passages like 'He\nwished, may I be many, may I grow forth,' and 'He thought, may I be many, may\nI grow forth,' show, in the first place, that the Self is the agent in the\nindependent activity which is preceded by the Self's reflection; and, in the\nsecond place, that it is the material cause also, since the words 'May I be\nmany' intimate that the reflective desire of multiplying itself has the inward\nSelf for its object.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 25](sbe34136.htm)\n\n"
