To Him who is incarnate in the Teacher, to Him in the\nEffulgent Form Facing the South, to Him (Siva) be this bow!\n\np. 75\n\n#### Objection to the Vedic doctrine of the one Existence and Light.\n\nThe identity of Brahman and Jiva, thus far set forth as the teaching of the\nVedas, is objected to by some who allege that it is opposed to all evidence\nfurnished by pratyaksha and other right sources of knowledge. By way of\nanswering their objections, the Vedic doctrine of the identity of Jiva and\nBrahman will be more firmly established in this and the two following\nchapters:\n\n1\\. "Self-existent do the pot, the cloth, and other phenomena shine,--not\nbecause of Isvara entering into them." To this as a reply is (the fourth\nstanza) chanted.\n\nThe Vedic doctrine that there is only one Existence and Light which is Atman (\n_vide_ chap. iii. 3) is objected to on the ground that it is opposed to our\nimmediate experience. It is, some say, an uncontradicted fact of experience\nthat a pot exists and shines by itself; and they contend that there is no\nevidence whatever to show that Isvara has entered into the phenomena so that\nthey all shine by His light.\n\nThe meaning of the fourth stanza may be explained as follows:\n\np. 76\n\n#### External objects have no existence and light of their own.\n\n2\\. If in the objective consciousness "I know it," the thinker were not to\nmanifest himself as \'I,\' what is there to shine, or to whom? And the whole\nworld would be like one asleep.\n\nIf an object were to shine alone by itself, then there would be no\nmanifestation of the Thinker as the cogniser of the object, in the form "I am\nconscious of the object." Then, like a lamp burning in a mountain-cave closed\nup on every side by solid rocks, no object will present itself to the\nconsciousness of any individual. Thus unconscious, as in sushupti, of the\nuniverse around, man would ever be quite as inert and unconcerned in the\nuniverse around as he is during. sleep. Wherefore it must be admitted that the\nuniverse depends on something else for its manifestation. That something else,\nthat light upon which the universe depends for its manifestation, must be a\nconstant and independent light, itself not depending on another for\nmanifestation.\n\nJust as the universe depends for its manifestation upon a light beyond itself,\nso also it depends\n\np. 77\n\non another for its existence. So, the Vartikakara says:\n\n3\\. The non-existent in the past and in the future cannot exist by themselves\neven in the present; therefore, they have their being in the Isa, the Lord, as\nto whom there is no before and after.\n\nExternal objects have no existence of their own, inasmuch as, like a serpent\nseen in a rope, they are only occasionally perceived. If they could exist by\nthemselves, they would also manifest by themselves like Atman, and thus they\nwould not be objects of consciousness of an individual, which they are\ninvariably now found to be.\n\nOn the other hand, as the Being whence everything proceeds at its birth and\nwhither everything recedes at the end, as the Pratyagatman who witnesses all\nstates of being in His never-failing light, Isvara\'s existence and\nconsciousness must be unfailing. Never was a time when He was not li and did\nnot shine; never will be a time when He will not be and will not shine.\n\np. 78\n\n4-5\\. If the insentient objects were to shine by themselves independent of\nIsvara, either everything would present itself to every one\'s consciousness,\nor nothing at all would present itself to consciousness. Therefore the whole\nworld would be on one level, either all-knowing or knowing nothing.\n\n_Independent of Isvara:_ without a self-conscious Atman perceiving them. If\nexternal objects were to shine by their own light, they would always shine and\nappear to all individuals alike as objects of consciousness. If it be,\nhowever, in their nature not to become objects of consciousness, then no\nindividual would be conscious of any of the objects. All individuals being\nthus situated alike as to their knowledge of external objects, it would be\ndifficult to account for the varying degrees of knowledge of the different\nindividuals. Then the result would be:\n\n5-6 If the sentient and the insentient\n\np. 79\n\nbe alike self-luminous, then it would follow that each alike will both\nperceive, and be in turn perceived by, the other, and so on; and, the sense-\norgans being unrestricted in their scope of perception, taste could be known\nby the eye, and so on.\n\nThus the contention that external objects are self-luminous and self-existent\nis opposed to our uncontradicted experience of a distinction between subject\nand object, as well as to the fact that the external objects have all of them\na more or less temporary existence.\n\n#### Isvara cognises and acts through upadhis.\n\n7-8\\. Manifesting Himself by way of reflection in the Kriya-sakti and Jnana-\nsakti, in the two sides of Antah-karana which are like unto the dull and the\nclear,--the back and the front--sides of a mirror, the Lord is spoken of as\nthe doer and the knower.\n\np. 80\n\nPrana constitutes that aspect of Antah-karana which is spoken of as Kriya-\nsakti, _i.e._ , wherein Isvara manifests Himself in many a form of activity.\nIt corresponds to the dark or back side of a mirror. Manas and Buddhi\nconstitute that aspect of Antah-karana which is here spoken of as Jnana-sakti,\nwherein Isvara manifests Himself as a self-conscious cogniser. This\ncorresponds to the clear or front side of a mirror. The self-conscious Atman,\nwhen associated with the upadhi of prana in activity, by way of lending to it\nHis own existence and light, is spoken of as the doer; and when associated, in\nthe same way, with the Manas and Buddhi which undergo changes of condition, He\nis said to cognise.\n\n#### The organ of cognition.\n\n8-9\\. Like unto a clear mirror, Buddhi, because of the predominance of Sattva\nin it and in virtue of the reflection of Atman in it receives images of\nexternal objects.\n\nThe predominance of Sattva is necessary, since otherwise Rajas and Tamas would\ngive rise to covetousness and forgetfulness.\n\np. 81\n\n9-10\\. And so do all the indriyas (senses), because of their connection with\nthe Antahkarana; they are like spokes attached to the felly of a wheel.\n\nThat is to say, though by nature the indriyas move towards their respective\nobjects, still their action is limited and controlled by the Buddhi; so that\nperception or non-perception or misperception of sense-objects through the\nsense-organs depends, at any given moment, on the state of the antahkarana at\nthe time.\n\n#### Nadis, the vehicles of the sense-organs.\n\n10-11\\. There are nadis woven in the antah-karana, like unto threads woven\ninto a net. By them, verily, reaching up to the physical regions of sensation,\nall sense-organs move, like sparks of fire, towards their respective objects.\n\n_Antah-karana_ is the Linga-Sarira impregnated with Jnana-sakti and Kriya-\nsakti, _i.e._ , endued with the faculties of cognition and action.\n\np. 82\n\n_Nadis_ are tube-like threads of subtle ethereal matter in the body. It is\nthrough these Nadis that all the senses, accompanied with the mind in one or\nanother of its forms, pass towards their respective objects in the external\nworld. When passing from the sushupti to the jagrat or waking state of\nconsciousness, these sense-organs pass up to the very physical regions of\nsensation, such as the eye, the ear, etc.\n\n12\\. The midmost portion of the body is spoken of as the Muladhara, \'the\nprimary seat\'; it is two inches above the anus and two inches below the penis.\n\n13-14\\. It is triangular, with the apex turned downwards, like a young girl\'s\norgan of generation; and there dwells the Para-Sakti, the Supreme force called\nKundalini, the mother of Prana, Agni, Bindu, and Nada; she is called\nSarasvati.\n\np. 83\n\nKundalini is the Devata or the governing Intelligence in the Muladhara. She is\nso called because she manifests Herself in the form of a serpent. This Supreme\nForce, called also Mulaprakriti, illumined by the Light of the Supreme Atman,\ngenerates Prana, etc. Prana is Vayu or the Universal Force of activity,\nspecified, on entering each individual being, into its vitality in its five-\nfold function. Agni, in one of its forms, is the digestive fire in the\nstomach. Agni and Prana are mentioned together in the Yoga-sastra under the\ndesignations of sun and moon. These are the Devatas of Ida and Pingala to be\nmentioned below. _Bindu_ is the unmanifested sound; and _Nada_ is the\nmanifested sound in general, the Omkara, that form of sound which is common to\nall articulate sounds, and which one may hear on closing both the ears. All\nthese are generated and propelled by Kundalini. She is also. called Sarasvati\nwhen, in one of her aspects as prana, she manifests herself in the nada, and\nthen in the form of articulate sounds.\n\nThe Muladhara, the primary seat of the three great Nadis, has been thus\ndescribed in some detail in order that the devotee who seeks illumination may\nmeditate upon it for the purpose.\n\n14-15\\. Starting from the apex of the\n\np. 84\n\n[paragraph continues] Muladhara, the Sushumna reaches the Brahmarandhra; it is\nlike a half-cut bamboo at the root, and has six supports.\n\nThe Sushumna manifests itself at the apex of the Muladhara and extends into\nthe cavity of the head. It is uniform throughout, long and straight, visible\nonly to the yogins. The six supports of the Sushumna, called _Chakras_ , have\neach of them a particular form and a particular seat of its own. They may be\npresented in a tabular form as follows:--\n\nName of Chakra.\n\n|\n\nIts form\n\n|\n\nIts seat.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n1\\. Muladhara\n\n|\n\nFour-petalled lotus\n\n|\n\nMuladhara.  \n  \n2\\. Svadhisthana\n\n|\n\nSix-petalled lotus\n\n|\n\nLinga or organ of generation.  \n  \n3\\. Manipuraka\n\n|\n\nTen \xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nNavel.  \n  \n4\\. Anahata\n\n|\n\nTwelve \xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nHeart.  \n  \n5\\. Visuddha\n\n|\n\nSixteen \xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nThroat.  \n  \n6\\. Ajna\n\n|\n\nTwo \xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nRegion between the two eyebrows.  \n  \n15-16\\. Starting from the corners thereof there are two Nadis, Ida and\nPingala. These, as the Yogins say, constitute the Nadi-chakra, or Nadi-system.\nThence all nadis proceed.\n\np. 85\n\nIda lies on the left, and Pingala lies on the right. They extend up to the\nbasis of the forehead.\n\n16-22\\. Gandhari and Hastijihva run up to the eyes. Joined to the Nadi-chakra,\nthere are two n\xc4\x81d\xc4\xabs reaching up to the nose. Starting from the region of navel\ncalled N\xc4\x81d\xc4\xab-chakra, which is shaped like a hen\'s egg, Pusha, and Alambusha\nnadis\n\np. 86\n\nextend up to the two ears. The nadi called Sukla (white, starts from the same\nplace and goes to the mid-region between the eye-brows. The nadi named\nSarasvati goes to the tip of the tongue and gives vent to speech. The nadi (in\nthe stomach) named Visvodari eats the four kinds of food. Payasvini, situated\nin the throat, drinks water and causes sneezing. Three nadis start downwards\nfrom the Nadi-chakra: Raka excretes semen; Sinivali, the urine; and Kuhu, the\ndung. That nadi, again, which is called Sankhini takes up the essence of the\nfood when eaten, and reaching the akasa of the cerebral cavity, there in the\nhead gathers the immortal nectar.\n\nThis immortal nectar is, as the yogins say obtainable in that region of the\nhead which is called Sahasrara-padma, the Thousand-petalled Lotus, by the\nprocess called Lambika-yoga. ( _Vide_ Chap. IX., 32).\n\np. 87\n\n22-23\\. "There are one-hundred-and-one nadis. Of them one goes to the head.\nGoing upwards by that, one becomes liberated." Such is the Vedanta\'s teaching.\n\nThe passage referred to is the Katha-Upanishad VI., 16.\n\n#### Jagrat state.\n\n23-24\\. When the Atman, through the sense-organs which are impelled by the\ngood (and bad) karma ingrained in the Buddhi, perceives sound and other\nobjects of sense, then it is the Jagrat or waking state.\n\nIt is certain that whenever Jiva does any act, he does not do so by himself,\nbut only as identifying himself with the Buddhi, into which he enters by a\nreflected image as it were. Accordingly it is the Buddhi that is affected by\nthe good or evil act, and its character is changed to the extent that it is\naffected by the act. When proper time, place, and other circumstances present\nthemselves for a good or evil deed to bear its fruit, then the Antah-karana\n\np. 88\n\nimpels the sense-organs to action. By the sense-organs which, starting from\nthe heart--the seat of Antah-karana--reach the extremities of the physical\norgans of sensation, Atman becomes conscious of sound and other sense-objects\nwithin and without the body. This constitutes the Jagrat-avastha, the waking\nstate of Jiva. Thus Jagrat state consists in cognising sense-objects by means\nof the sense-organs.\n\n#### Svapna.\n\n24-25\\. When these sense-organs are withdrawn, A\'tman is conscious of the\nmental images generated by the impressions of Jagrat experience. It is the\nSvapna-avastha or the dream-state.\n\nWhen the senses are withdrawn into the cavities of the nadis within the body,\n_i.e._ , when the network of the nadis, through which the senses are coursing,\nis drawn back from the extremities of the physical organs of sensation into\nthe body by the thread of the antah-karana (inclusive of prana), then Atman is\nno longer conscious of external objects. He sees, however, the mental forms,\n\np. 89\n\nimages which are purely manasic, evolved out of the impressions made on the\nmind during the jagrat state. Thus Svapna consists in cognising, on the\nwithdrawal of the senses, those forms of mind which are evolved out of the\nimpressions received during jagrat state.\n\n#### Sushupti.\n\n25\\. The withdrawal of even manas itself is spoken of as Sushupti.\n\nThe manas is said to withdraw, when, with all its vasanas or impressions, it\nattains to the causal stage, to the state of avidya. Thus Sushupti consists in\nthe Buddhis attaining to the form of its cause,--in all forms of cognition\nceasing to appear.\n\nThus all the three avasthas of self-conscious A\'tman are due to his\nassociation with the upadhis undergoing changes of state such as Jagrat; and\nthese upadhis cannot come into association with the self-conscious A\'tman\nexcept by Maya.\n\n#### Atman is ever Sat-Chit-Ananda.\n\n26\\. Then the Atman remains as pure Existence, veiled by Maya. It is by\n\np. 90\n\nconnection with Maya that He appears as deluded, inert, ignorant, and so on.\n\nAtman is ever one with Brahman, the Absolute Existence; but, owing to Maya\nwhich veils his true character as Brahman, we are not conscious of the fact,\nexcept in so far as we always feel that we exist.\n\n27\\. "I slept happy:" thus on awaking does Atman clearly manifest Himself as\nExistence, Consciousness and Bliss.\n\nThe word \'happy\' refers to the essential constant nature of Atman as self-\nconscious Existence and Bliss. The word \'slept\' refers to the then quiescent\nstate of all upadhis. The happiness experienced in sushupti is not, indeed,\naccidental; it does not come from an external source, since then the sense-\norgans by which the external objects can be experienced are quiescent. The\nhappiness does not certainly arise from the mere cessation of all active\nprocesses of life and conscious existence, inasmuch as there is no instance in\nall our experience where any positive result comes out of circumstances of a\npurely negative character. Nor again should it be supposed that happiness then\nexperienced\n\np. 91\n\nis itself of a negative character, consisting in the mere absence of pain; for\nthere is, then, no organ by which to experience the absence of pain, and what\nhas not been experienced cannot subsequently be remembered. The feeling "I\nslept happy" is clearly a case of remembering what has been experienced. Thus\nthe happiness experienced during sleep points to the self-luminous nature of\nAtman as Bliss. The immutable, partless, self-conscious Atman cannot be spoken\nof as lying down or as going, or as sleeping, in Himself. All this is,\ntherefore, due to His association with the upadhis which undergo changes of\nstate. Wherefore the words "I slept" refer to the quiescent state of the\nupadhis in sushupti. Hence in all states of consciousness, Atman remains the\nsame as Existence, Consciousness and Bliss.\n\n#### Isvara, the one Light and Existence.\n\n26\\. It Is by Mahesvara, penetrating the whole universe and manifesting\nHimself, that even the sun and other (lights) shine; how much more so pots and\nother things?\n\nBrahman\'s manifestations in the upadhis of the cosmos and of the individual\nbody may be exhibited in a tabular form as follows:--\n\np. 92\n\nMacrocosm (Adhidaiva, Samashti, Karana).\n\n|\n\nMicrocosm (Adhyatma, Vyashti, Karya).\n\n|\n\nState of Consciousness.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nUpadhi.\n\n|\n\nBrahman\'s manifestation\n\n|\n\nUpadhi.\n\n|\n\nBrahman\'s manifestation.  \n  \nAvyakrita or Avyakta.\n\n|\n\nIsvara or Akshara. *\n\n|\n\nKarana-sarira.\n\n|\n\nPrajna.\n\n|\n\nSushupti.  \n  \nHiranyagarbha.\n\n|\n\nSutratman.\n\n|\n\nLinga-sarira.\n\n|\n\nTaijasa.\n\n|\n\nSvapna.  \n  \nViraj.\n\n|\n\nVaisyanara.\n\n|\n\nSthula-sarira.\n\n|\n\nVisva.\n\n|\n\nJagrat.  \n  \n29\\. Therefore, all things derive their being and light from the being and\nlight of Isvara in whom they abide. And by Sruti Brahman is declared to be\n"the Real, Consciousness, the Endless."\n\nThat is to say, things have no being of their own. They are said to exist\nbecause they are illusory expressions of Isvara, the one Existence.\n\np. 93\n\n30\\. All that comes into being in Jagrat and Svapna is unreal, senseless like\na blind man.\n\n#### Isvara as the Ego.\n\nAnd Isvara manifests Himself as the Ego in all creatures.\n\n31-32\\. The undifferentiated or Universal (Ego), the Pure, and the impure:\nthus the Ego is threefold. The undifferentiated or Universal (Ego) is the\nSupreme Brahman, who is devoid of all distinctions, like unto akasa free from\ndust, darkness, smoke and cloud.\n\n32-33\\. The Pure (Ego is seen) at the time of discrimination, when He is rid\nof the body and other upadhis, as akasa is\n\np. 94\n\nseen a little through the starlight to a limited extent.\n\nThough, under ordinary circumstances, Atman does not present Himself to all,\nHe does occasionally manifest Himself to him who has thoroughly investigated\nthe nature of Jiva and the Isvara, and is convinced that the physical body and\nother upadhis are not the Ego; and who has accordingly stripped his Real Ego\nof all the limitations ascribed to Him. This Pure Ego, manifested temporarily\nas He is at the moment of discrimination, is somewhat removed from the\nAbsolute or Universal Ego, who is Brahman Himself.\n\n33-34\\. Impure is the Ego stained by an intimate association with the body and\nsense-organs and other upadhis; just as akasa, pervaded by darkness, looks as\nif affording no space.\n\n34-35\\. When Jiva is well awakened to his Ego being one with Isvara, then can\nhe be the all-knower and the all-maker.\n\np. 95\n\n35-36\\. The Lord, by Maya quite deluded, by Vidya manifests Himself. By\nmeditating on the Nirvikalpa or the Un- differentiated Ego, Atman shines in\nfull.\n\n36-37\\. The veil of avidya removed, the Supreme Lord, He who is Dakshinamurti\nin form, shines in full Himself.\n\n37-38\\. Thus ends the fourth chapter in brief in the work called Manasollasa\nwhich expounds the meaning of the Hymn to the Blessed Dakshinamurti.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[92:*](dast08.htm#fr_1) The name "Isvara" is given to Brahman\'s manifestation\nin the upadhi called Avyakrita, as well as to Brahman beyond the upadhis.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter V.
