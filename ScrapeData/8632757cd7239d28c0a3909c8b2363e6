I feel as\nif I have passed through a whole series of births, time has been flying so\nfast, I did not feel it move at all, till the shock came the other day.\n\nI knew there would be words between us when I made up my mind to ask my\nhusband to banish foreign goods from our market. But it was my firm belief\nthat I had no need to meet argument by argument, for there was magic in the\nvery air about me. Had not so tremendous a man as Sandip fallen helplessly at\nmy feet, like a wave of the mighty sea breaking on the shore? Had I called\nhim? No, it was the summons of that magic spell of mine. And Amulya, poor dear\nboy, when he first came to me--how the current of his life flushed with\ncolour, like the river at dawn! Truly have I realized how a goddess feels when\nshe looks upon the radiant face of her devotee.\n\nWith the confidence begotten of these proofs of my power, I was ready to meet\nmy husband like a lightning-charged cloud. But what was it that happened?\nNever in all these nine years have I seen such a far-away, distraught look in\nhis eyes--like the desert sky--with no merciful moisture of its own, no colour\nreflected, even, from what it looked upon. I should have been so relieved if\nhis anger had flashed out! But I could find nothing in him which I could\ntouch. I felt as unreal as a dream--a dream which would leave only the\nblackness of night when it was over.\n\nIn the old days I used to be jealous of my sister-in-law for her beauty. Then\nI used to feel that Providence had given me no power of my own, that my whole\nstrength lay in the love which my husband had bestowed on me. Now that I had\ndrained to the dregs the cup of power and could not do without its\nintoxication, I suddenly found it dashed to pieces at my feet, leaving me\nnothing to live for.\n\nHow feverishly I had sat to do my hair that day. Oh, shame, shame on me, the\nutter shame of it! My sister-in-law, when passing by, had exclaimed: "Aha,\nChota Rani! Your hair seems ready to jump off. Don\'t let it carry your head\nwith it."\n\nAnd then, the other day in the garden, how easy my husband found it to tell me\nthat he set me free! But can freedom--empty freedom--be given and taken so\neasily as all that? It is like setting a fish free in the sky--for how can I\nmove or live outside the atmosphere of loving care which has always sustained\nme?\n\nWhen I came to my room today, I saw only furniture--only the bedstead, only\nthe looking-glass, only the clothes-rack--not the all-pervading heart which\nused to be there, over all. Instead of it there was freedom, only freedom,\nmere emptiness! A dried-up watercourse with all its rocks and pebbles laid\nbare. No feeling, only furniture!\n\nWhen I had arrived at a state of utter bewilderment, wondering whether\nanything true was left in my life, and whereabouts it could be, I happened to\nmeet Sandip again. Then life struck against life, and the sparks flew in the\nsame old way. Here was truth--impetuous truth--which rushed in and overflowed\nall bounds, truth which was a thousand times truer than the Bara Rani with her\nmaid, Thako and her silly songs, and all the rest of them who talked and\nlaughed and wandered about ...\n\n"Fifty thousand!" Sandip had demanded.\n\n"What is fifty thousand?" cried my intoxicated heart. "You shall have it!"\n\nHow to get it, where to get it, were minor points not worth troubling over.\nLook at me. Had I not risen, all in one moment, from my nothingness to a\nheight above everything? So shall all things come at my beck and call. I shall\nget it, get it, get it-- there cannot be any doubt.\n\nThus had I come away from Sandip the other day. Then as I looked about me,\nwhere was it--the tree of plenty? Oh, why does this outer world insult the\nheart so?\n\nAnd yet get it I must; how, I do not care; for sin there cannot be. Sin taints\nonly the weak; I with my _Shakti_ am beyond its reach. Only a commoner can be\na thief, the king conquers and takes his rightful spoil ... I must find out\nwhere the treasury is; who takes the money in; who guards it.\n\nI spent half the night standing in the outer verandah peering at the row of\noffice buildings. But how to get that fifty thousand rupees out of the\nclutches of those iron bars? If by some _mantram_ I could have made all those\nguards fall dead in their places, I would not have hesitated--so pitiless did\nI feel!\n\nBut while a whole gang of robbers seemed dancing a war-dance within the\nwhirling brain of its Rani, the great house of the Rajas slept in peace. The\ngong of the watch sounded hour after hour, and the sky overhead placidly\nlooked on.\n\nAt last I sent for Amulya.\n\n"Money is wanted for the Cause," I told him. "Can you not get it out of the\ntreasury?"\n\n"Why not?" said he, with his chest thrown out.\n\nAlas! had I not said "Why not?" to Sandip just in the same way? The poor lad\'s\nconfidence could rouse no hopes in my mind.\n\n"How will you do it?" I asked.\n\nThe wild plans he began to unfold would hardly bear repetition outside the\npages of a penny dreadful.\n\n"No, Amulya," I said severely, "you must not be childish."\n\n"Very well, then," he said, "let me bribe those watchmen."\n\n"Where is the money to come from?"\n\n"I can loot the bazar," he burst out, without blenching.\n\n"Leave all that alone. I have my ornaments, they will serve.\n\n"But," said Amulya, "it strikes me that the cashier cannot be bribed. Never\nmind, there is another and simpler way."\n\n"What is that?"\n\n"Why need you hear it? It is quite simple."\n\n"Still, I should like to know."\n\nAmulya fumbled in the pocket of his tunic and pulled out, first a small\nedition of the _Gita_ , which he placed on the table-- and then a little\npistol, which he showed me, but said nothing further.\n\nHorror! It did not take him a moment to make up his mind to kill our good old\ncashier!  23 To look at his frank, open face one would not have thought him\ncapable of hurting a fly, but how different were the words which came from his\nmouth. It was clear that the cashier\'s place in the world meant nothing real\nto him; it was a mere vacancy, lifeless, feelingless, with only stock phrases\nfrom the _Gita--Who kills the body kills naught!\n\n_\n\n"Whatever do you mean, Amulya?" I exclaimed at length. "Don\'t you know that\nthe dear old man has got a wife and children and that he is ..."\n\n"Where are we to find men who have no wives and children?" he interrupted.\n"Look here, Maharani, the thing we call pity is, at bottom, only pity for\nourselves. We cannot bear to wound our own tender instincts, and so we do not\nstrike at all--pity indeed! The height of cowardice!"\n\nTo hear Sandip\'s phrases in the mouth of this mere boy staggered me. So\ndelightfully, lovably immature was he--of that age when the good may still be\nbelieved in as good, of that age when one really lives and grows. The Mother\nin me awoke.\n\nFor myself there was no longer good or bad--only death, beautiful alluring\ndeath. But to hear this stripling calmly talk of murdering an inoffensive old\nman as the right thing to do, made me shudder all over. The more clearly I saw\nthat there was no sin in his heart, the more horrible appeared to me the sin\nof his words. I seemed to see the sin of the parents visited on the innocent\nchild.\n\nThe sight of his great big eyes shining with faith and enthusiasm touched me\nto the quick. He was going, in his fascination, straight to the jaws of the\npython, from which, once in, there was no return. How was he to be saved? Why\ndoes not my country become, for once, a real Mother--clasp him to her bosom\nand cry out: "Oh, my child, my child, what profits it that you should save me,\nif so it be that I should fail to save you?"\n\nI know, I know, that all Power on earth waxes great under compact with Satan.\nBut the Mother is there, alone though she be, to contemn and stand against\nthis devil\'s progress. The Mother cares not for mere success, however great--\nshe wants to give life, to save life. My very soul, today, stretches out its\nhands in yearning to save this child.\n\nA while ago I suggested robbery to him. Whatever I may now say against it will\nbe put down to a woman\'s weakness. They only love our weakness when it drags\nthe world in its toils!\n\n"You need do nothing at all, Amulya, I will see to the money," I told him\nfinally. When he had almost reached the door, I called him back.\n\n"Amulya," said I, "I am your elder sister. Today is not the Brothers\' Day  24\naccording to the calendar, but all the days in the year are really Brothers\'\nDays. My blessing be with you: may God keep you always."\n\nThese unexpected words from my lips took Amulya by surprise. He stood stock-\nstill for a time. Then, coming to himself, he prostrated himself at my feet in\nacceptance of the relationship and did me reverence. When he rose his eyes\nwere full of tears... O little brother mine! I am fast going to my death--let\nme take all your sin away with me. May no taint from me ever tarnish your\ninnocence!\n\nI said to him: "Let your offering of reverence be that pistol!"\n\n"What do you want with it, sister?"\n\n"I will practise death."\n\n"Right, sister. Our women, also, must know how to die, to deal death!" with\nwhich Amulya handed me the pistol. The radiance of his youthful countenance\nseemed to tinge my life with the touch of a new dawn. I put away the pistol\nwithin my clothes. May this reverence-offering be the last resource in my\nextremity ...\n\nThe door to the mother\'s chamber in my woman\'s heart once opened, I thought it\nwould always remain open. But this pathway to the supreme good was closed when\nthe mistress took the place of the mother and locked it again. The very next\nday I saw Sandip; and madness, naked and rampant, danced upon my heart.\n\nWhat was this? Was this, then, my truer self? Never! I had never before known\nthis shameless, this cruel one within me. The snake-charmer had come,\npretending to draw this snake from within the fold of my garment--but it was\nnever there, it was his all the time. Some demon has gained possession of me,\nand what I am doing today is the play of his activity--it has nothing to do\nwith me.\n\nThis demon, in the guise of a god, had come with his ruddy torch to call me\nthat day, saying: "I am your Country. I am your Sandip. I am more to you than\nanything else of yours. _Bande Mataram_!" And with folded hands I had\nresponded: "You are my religion. You are my heaven. Whatever else is mine\nshall be swept away before my love for you. _Bande Mataram_!"\n\nFive thousand is it? Five thousand it shall be! You want it tomorrow? Tomorrow\nyou shall have it! In this desperate orgy, that gift of five thousand shall be\nas the foam of wine--and then for the riotous revel! The immovable world shall\nsway under our feet, fire shall flash from our eyes, a storm shall roar in our\nears, what is or is not in front shall become equally dim. And then with\ntottering footsteps we shall plunge to our death--in a moment all fire will be\nextinguished, the ashes will be scattered, and nothing will remain behind.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[23](hw34.htm#fr_22) The cashier is the official who is most in touch with the\nladies of a _zamindar\'s_ household, directly taking their requisitions for\nhousehold stores and doing their shopping for them, and so he becomes more a\nmember of the family than the others. [Trans.].\n\n[24](hw34.htm#fr_23) The daughter of the house occupies a place of specially\ntender affection in a Bengali household (perhaps in Hindu households all over\nIndia) because, by dictate of custom, she must be given away in marriage so\nearly. She thus takes corresponding memories with her to her husband\'s home,\nwhere she has to begin as a stranger before she can get into her place. The\nresulting feeling, of the mistress of her new home for the one she has left,\nhas taken ceremonial form as the Brothers\' Day, on which the brothers are\ninvited to the married sisters\' houses. Where the sister is the elder, she\noffers her blessing and receives the brother\'s reverence, and vice versa.\nPresents, called the offerings of reverence (or blessing), are exchanged.\n[Trans.].\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XV](hw35.htm)\n\n'
