Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O King of the Brahma _n_ as! You said that Rama and\nKri _sn_ a took their incarnations to relieve the burden of earth. One great\ndoubt arises in my mind on this point. At the end of the Dvapara Yuga, the\nEarth, burdened and oppressed very much, assumed, in anguish, the form of a\ncow and took refuge under Brahma. Brahma, then, went with the Earth to Vi _sn_\nu, the Lord of Lak _s_ mi, and thus prayed, \xc2\x93O Bibhu! Let You, with all the\nother gods, incarnate soon on earth at the house of Vasudeva to relieve the\nEarth of Her load, as well as to protect the righteous.\xc2\x94 When Brahma thus\nprayed, the Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u incarnated as the son of Devaki, along with\nBalarama to lessen the burden of the Earth. And, in fact, he relieved, to a\ncertain extent, the Earth by killing many vicious persons and many wicked and\nirreligious Kings. But, along with that, Bhi _s_ ma, Dro _n_ a, Vira _t_ a,\nDrupada, Somadatta, and Kar _n_ a, the son of the Sun were killed. But, See!\nthat those who plundered afterwards His riches, and stole away the wives of\nHari, those crores of \xc3\x82bhiras, S\xc2\x92akas, Mlechchas, and Ni _s_ adas and other\nvicious people remained alive; and how could it, then, be said that the Earth\nwas relieved when Kri _sn_ a did not kill those people! O Fortunate One! When\nI see all the people in this Kali Yuga addicted to sinful acts, this great\ndoubt is not going out of my mind (how the Earth had been relieved of Her\nload).\n\n\n\n11-14. Vyasa said :-- O King! As the Yuga changes, so the people changes in\ncourse of time. Nothing can alter its course, for this is caused by the Yuga\nDharma (the Dharma peculiar to each Yuga). Therefore if all the subjects that\nare considered wicked and vicious according to the law of the Yuga Dharma,\nthen this creation would be destroyed; hence Kri _sn_ a killed only those\nDanavas and vicious K _s_ attriyas that were really the burden of Earth. O\nKing! The persons that are devoted to religion take their births in the Satya\nYuga; those that are fond of religion and wealth they become manifest in the\nTreta Yuga; those that like Dharma (religion), Artha (wealth) and\n\n\n\np. 519\n\n\n\nKama (desires), they are born in the Dvapara Yuga, and those that dote on\nwealth and lust, they are seen in the Kali Yuga. O King! Know this as certain\nthat these characteristics, peculiar to each Yuga, never vary; and know this\ntoo, that Time, the Lord of Dharma and Adharma, is always present.\n\n\n\n15-18. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Intelligent One! Where are those pious persons now\nthat were born as high-souled religious persons in the Satya Yuga; where are\nthose Munis now who were devoted to charity in the Treta or Dvapara Yuga?\nAgain where will go these shameless and merciless persons, that are being seen\nnow in this Kali Yuga, these vicious creatures that revile their own Gurus? O\nHighly Intelligent One! I am very eager to know how these religious matters\nare brought to a decision and settlement; kindly describe to me in detail all\nthese secret truths.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n19-30. Vyasa said :-- O King! Persons, born in the Satya Yuga, that perform\nacts of merit, go to the Deva Loka. O King! The Brahmi _n_ s, K _s_ attriyas,\nVais\xc2\x92yas and S\xc2\x92udras, if they remain in their own spheres and if they be\ndevoted to religious acts, go to their respective spheres, earned by their\nmeritorious deeds. By virtue of truth, mercy, charity, going to one\xc2\x92s own\nwives, not injuring animals, and having no jealousy and showing mercy equally\ntowards all, by practising these universal forms of religion, even the lowest\ncastes, e.g., washermen and others all go to the Paradise. So in the Treta and\nDvapara Yugas men go to Heaven by virtue of their merits, earned in practising\ntheir own Dharma; but in this Kali Yuga persons addicted to vicious acts go to\nterrible hells and remain there till the end of the Kali Yuga when they will\nbe again born in this earth. O King! When the Satya Yuga begins and the Kali\nYuga ends, at this junction time, the virtuous highsouled persons descend from\nHeaven and are born on this earth; and when the Kali begins and the Dvapara\nends, the vicious souls come on the earth again from their hells. O King! Know\nthis as the course of Time; it never becomes otherwise. See, then, that the\nKali Yuga tends to do vicious things and the people, therefore, become\nvicious. At times, the birth of beings takes place otherwise than the laws of\nYugas, out of the strange combinations of Fate (i.e., good persons are seen in\nthe Kali and vicious persons are seen in the Satya). For this reason those\nthat do meritorious acts in the Kali Yuga are born as men in the Dvapara; so\nthe Dvapara good persons take their births as men in the Treta; and the Treta\ngood persons are born as men in the Satya Yuga. Again those who are vicious in\nthe Satya Yuga become persons of the Kali Yuga. The Jivas suffer miseries on\naccount of their own bad Karmas; they again suffer more miseries\n\n\n\np. 520\n\n\n\nby doing over and over again those bad Karmas by virtue of the Yuga Dharma.\n\n\n\n31\\. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! Describe particularly the details of the\nYuga Dharma. I am now very desirous to hear which Dharma is for which Yuga?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n32-54. Vyasa said :-- O King! I will now show to you by example the influence\nof the religion peculiar to each Yuga; hear it attentively. O King! The hearts\neven of saints are quite disturbed by the Yuga Dharma. See! Your father was a\nreligious and high-souled monarch; still the wicked Kali defiled his mind and\nprompted him to do an act very insulting to a Brahma _n_ a. Otherwise why\nwould he, being a renowned prince amongst the K _s_ attriyas and a descendant\nof Yayati, thus go and encircle a snake round the throat of an ascetic Brahmi\n_n_? Therefore, O King! All actions are being influenced by the Yuga Dharma.\nThe Pundits, also recognise this. If you try your best to perform any\nreligious act, even then the Yuga Dharma would prevail, yet you would be able\nto perform to a certain extent, a part of your intention. O King! In the Satya\nYuga, the Brahmi _n_ s were versed in the Vedas, always devoted to worship the\nHighest Force, with an ardent desire to see the Devi; they were devoted to\nGayatri with Pra _n_ ava, devoted to the meditation of Gayatri, always\nreciting silently Gayatri, and the Mayavija Mantram, the chief mantram. In\nevery village, the Brahmi _n_ s were very eager to erect temples of the Devi\nMaha Maya Ambika and were truthful, merciful and pure and devoted to their own\nrespective works. The K _s_ attriyas, skilled in the science of the highest\nknowledge, were ever engaged in doing things ordained by the Vedas and were\nalways intent in protecting well their subjects. The Vais\xc2\x92yas did their\ncultivation and trade and the S\xc2\x92udras always served the other three castes.\nThus, in the Satya Yuga, all the Var _n_ as (castes) were devoted to the\nworship of the Devi Ambika, the Highest S\xc2\x92akti; but in the Treta Yuga, the\nobservance of the religion declined a little and in the Dvapara, it declined\nvery much. O Ornament of Indra! Those who were Rak _s_ asas before, they\nbecome the Brahmi _n_ s of the Kali Yuga; they are the flowers of atheists,\ndeceptors of men, untruthful, without any Vedas, devoid of the Vedic\npractices, arrogant, cunning, egoistic, and capable only to serve the S\xc2\x92udras.\nSome of them try to find fault with the Sanatan Dharma and are the\npromulgators of various other creeds, wicked, fallen from their religion and\ngiven to much talking. O King! As Kali gets stronger, so the true religion\ndeclines and ultimately dies; and, in that proportion, the K _s_ attriyas,\nVais\xc2\x92yas and S\xc2\x92udras are also devoid of their religion. When Kali will be in\nfull swing, the K _s_ attriyas, Vais\xc2\x92yas and S\xc2\x92udras will all be untruthful,\nvicious; the Brahmi _n_ s will act like S\xc2\x92udras and will accept other\xc2\x92s gifts.\nO King! The women in the\n\n\n\np. 521\n\n\n\nKali Yuga would be very passionate, avaricious and ignorant. They would be\nvery powerful and insolent, wilful, vicious and untruthful and so would be a\nsource of pain to the society. They would think themselves vainly religious\nand learned and would be always ready to impart religious instructions and\ndeceive their own husbands and be exceedingly vicious. O King! Our minds are\npurified by the food that we take; when our minds are pure, the Light of\nDharma shines clearly. The customs and practices of Var _n_ a and \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama\nDharmas get intermixed with each other and so arises the fault of Dharma\nS\xc2\x92amkara (i.e., mixture of the several parts of religion with each other).\nWhen the Dharma S\xc2\x92amkara creeps in, the Var _n_ a S\xc2\x92ankara is seen (i.e.,\npurity in blood and other matters of birth are lost). Thus, in the Kali Yuga,\nall the Dharmas will gradually die out and ultimately nothing will be heard\nabout one\xc2\x92s own religion. O King! In this Yuga even the religious high-souled\npersons will be found to do irreligious acts! The nature of Kali is so; nobody\nwill be able to quit it. O King! Thus, in this age, men naturally commit\nvicious things; with ordinary means, therefore, no one becomes able to\nextricate from the worst vicious habits.\n\n\n\n55-56. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! You know all and you are versed in all\nthe S\xc2\x92astras; what will be the fate of so many persons in this Kali Yuga? If\nthere be any path, kindly describe it to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n57-65. Vyasa said :-- O King! There is only one path and none other which can\nsave a man from the sin of this Kali; and that is this :-- The Jivas must\nmeditate on the lotus-feet of the Highest Devi for the purification of all\ntheir faults and sins. O King! There is so much strength in Her sin-destroying\nName, that the amount of sin in this world falls much less in proportion to\nthat. Where, then, is the cause of fear? Her Name, uttered at random, even in\nan unconscious state, bestows so much unspeakable results that even Hari, Hara\nand others have not the capacity to know that. O King! The mere remembrance of\nthe name of S\xc2\x92ri Devi is an atonement for a multitude of sins; then it behoves\nthat every man, afraid of the Kali Yuga, residing in a place of pilgrimage,\nought to remember incessantly the Name of the Highest Deity. Even if anybody\ncuts, pierces, and kills all the beings in this whole world, he won\xc2\x92t be\ntouched with the sins, if he bows down, with devotion, before the Devi. O\nKing! I have narrated to you all the secret truths of all the S\xc2\x92astras.\nConsider all these fully and always worship the lotus-feet of the Devi. All\nmen are reciting silently the Japam called the Ajapa Gayatri; still they do\nnot know the glory of it; such is the powerful influence of Maya. All the\nBrahma _n_ as are reciting in the depth of their hearts the Gayatri Mantram,\nyet they do not know the glory of it (otherwise they would have\n\n\n\np. 522\n\n\n\nbeen liberated); such is the great influence of Maya. O King! I have described\nto you all that you asked me about the Yuga Dharmas; what more do you want to\nhear?\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eleventh Chapter of the Sixth Book on the ascertainment of\nDharma in the Maha Pura _n_ am, S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 12](bk06ch12.htm)\n\n'
