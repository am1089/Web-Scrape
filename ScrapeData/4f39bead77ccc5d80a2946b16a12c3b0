Her lord's address  \nThe lady heard with deep distress.  \nAnd, as the tear bedimmed her eye,  \nIn soft low accents made reply:  \n'The perils of the wood, and all  \nThe woes thou countest to appal,  \nLed by my love I deem not pain;  \nEach woe a charm, each loss a gain,  \nTiger, and elephant, and deer,  \nBull, lion, buffalo, in fear,  \nSoon as thy matchless form they see,  \nWith every silvan beast will flee.  \nWith thee, O Rama, I must go:  \nMy sire's command ordains it so.  \nBereft of thee, my lonely heart  \nMust break, and life and I must part.  \nWhile thou, O mighty lord, art nigh,  \nNot even He who rules the sky,  \nThough He is strongest of the strong,  \nWith all his might can do me wrong.  \nNor can a lonely woman left  \nBy her dear husband live bereft.  \nIn my great love, my lord, I ween,  \nThe truth of this thou mayst have seen.  \nIn my sire's palace long ago  \nI heard the chief of those who know,  \nThe truth-declaring Brahmans, tell  \nMy fortune, in the wood to dwell.  \nI heard their promise who divine  \nThe future by each mark and sign,  \nAnd from that hour have longed to lead  \nThe forest life their lips decreed.  \nNow, mighty Rama, I must share  \nThy father's doom which sends thee there;  \nIn this I will not be denied,  \nBut follow, love, where thou shalt guide.  \nO husband, I will go with thee,  \nObedient to that high decree,  \nNow let the Brahmans' words be true,  \nFor this the time they had in view.  \nI know full well the wood has woes;  \nBut they disturb the lives of those  \nWho in the forest dwell, nor hold  \nTheir rebel senses well controlled.  \n\np. 129  \n\nIn my sire's halls, ere I was wed,  \nI heard a dame who begged her bread  \nBefore my mother's face relate  \nWhat griefs a forest life await.  \nAnd many a time in sport I prayed  \nTo seek with thee the greenwood shade,  \nFor O, my heart on this is set,  \nTo follow thee, dear anchoret.  \nMay blessings on thy life attend:  \nI long with thee my steps to bend,  \nFor with such hero as thou art  \nThis pilgrimage enchants my heart.  \nStill close, my lord, to thy dear side  \nMy spirit will be purified:  \nLove from all sin my soul will free:  \nMy husband is a God to me.  \nSo, love, with thee shall I have bliss  \nAnd share the life that follows this.  \nI heard a Brahman, dear to fame,  \nThis ancient Scripture text proclaim:  \n'The woman whom on earth below  \nHer parents on a man bestow,  \nAnd lawfully their hands unite  \nWith water and each holy rite,  \nShe in this world shall be his wife,  \nHis also in the after life.'  \nThen tell me, O beloved, why  \nThou wilt this earnest prayer deny,  \nNor take me with thee to the wood,  \nThine own dear wife so true and good.  \nBut if thou wilt not take me there  \nThus grieving in my wild despair,  \nTo fire or water I will fly,  \nOr to the poisoned draught, and die.'  \nSo thus to share his exile, she  \nBesought him with each earnest plea,  \nNor could she yet her lord persuade  \nTo take her to the lonely shade.  \nThe answer of the strong-armed chief  \nSmote the Videhan's soul with grief,  \nAnd from her eyes the torrents came  \nbathing the bosom of the dame.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXX.: The Triumph of Love.](ry108.htm)\n\n"
