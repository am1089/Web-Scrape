He presses out (the Soma juice) with 'Ih\xc4\x81\xcc\x83! Ih\xc4\x81\xcc\x83 2!' (hither),\nwhereby he draws Indra nigh; and\n\np. 332\n\nwith 'B _ri_ hat! B _ri_ hat!' (great), whereby he draws Indra 1 nigh.\n\n4:3:3:22\\. The _S_ ukra and Manthin grahas he draws first, for thereby the\nSoma feast comes to be supplied with pure Soma ( _s_ ukra). Thereupon the\n\xc3\x82graya _n_ a, for that (cup) is drawn at all (three) feasts. Then the\nMarutvatiya cup; then the Ukthya, for here also there are songs of praise\n(Uktha) 2.\n\n4:3:3:33\\. Now some draw the Marutvatiya after they have drawn the Ukthya; but\nlet him. not do this,--let him rather draw the Ukthya after he has drawn the\nMarutvatiya.\n\np. 333\n\n4:3:3:44\\. These, then, are five grahas he draws; for that midday Pavamana\nchant is a thunderbolt: hence it is a fifteenfold five-hymned chant 1, for the\nthunderbolt is fifteenfold 2. He is so by means of these five grahas (cups of\nSoma 3): for five are these fingers, and with the fingers he hurls (the\nthunderbolt).\n\n4:3:3:55\\. Indra hurled the thunderbolt at V _ri_ tra; and having smitten V\n_ri_ tra, the wicked, and safety and peace being secured 4, he led forth the\ndakshi _n_ as (gifts to priests). Wherefore now also, when they (the Udgat\n_ri_ s) chant the midday Pavamana, and safety and peace are secured, the\ndakshi _n_ as are led forth. And so, forsooth, does he now by means of those\nfive cups of Soma hurl the thunderbolt at the wicked, hateful enemy, and\nhaving smitten V _ri_ tra, the wicked, and safety and peace being\n\np. 334\n\nsecured, he leads forth the dakshi _n_ as. This is why he draws those five\ncups.\n\n4:3:3:66\\. Then as to why he draws the Marutvatiya cups. Now this, the midday\npressing feast, is Indra's special (nishkevalya) feast: thereby he strove to\nsmite V _ri_ tra, thereby he strove to vanquish him. But the Maruts, having on\nthat account 1 withdrawn, were standing on an A _s_ vattha tree 2 (Ficus\nReligiosa). Now Indra is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people, and\nthrough the people the noble becomes strong: therefore the two Ritu cups (they\nsay) 3 may be of a _s_ vattha wood; but in reality they are of karshmarya\nwood.\n\n4:3:3:77\\. Indra called on them, saying, 'Do ye join me that with you as my\nforce I may smite V _ri_ tra!' They said, 'What will be our (reward) then?' He\ndrew those two Marutvatiya cups for them.\n\n4:3:3:88\\. They said, 'Having put aside this one (cup) for our vigour, we will\njoin thee.' Having accordingly put it aside for their vigour 4, they joined\nhim. But Indra sought to obtain it, thinking, 'They have come to me after\nputting aside their vigour.'\n\np. 335\n\n4:3:3:99\\. He said, 'Do ye join me with vigour!'--'Then draw a third cup for\nus;' they said. He drew a third cup for them, with, 'Thou art taken with a\nsupport,--thee for the vigour of the Maruts!' They then joined him with\nvigour,--and he conquered with them, and smote V _ri_ tra with them;--for\nIndra is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people, and through the people\nthe noble becomes strong. Hence he now bestows that strength on the nobility,\nand therefore he draws the Marutvatiya cups.\n\n4:3:3:1010\\. Let him draw them for Indra Marutvat (accompanied by the Maruts),\nand not for the Maruts likewise. For were he also to draw cups for the Maruts,\nhe would make the people refractory to the nobility. He thus assigns to the\nMaruts a share therein after Indra, whereby he makes the people subservient\nand obedient to the nobility: therefore let him draw the cups for Indra\nMarutvat, and not for the Maruts likewise.\n\n4:3:3:1111\\. But he was afraid of their desertion,--'Lest they should desert\nme, lest they should take to some other (party) 1,' so thinking, he by that\n(share in the libation) made them unwilling to desert him. This is why he\nshould draw the grahas for Indra Marutvat.\n\n4:3:3:1212\\. He draws them with the two vessels of the seasons, for the year,\nthe sacrifice, means the seasons. There, at the morning Soma feast, they are\novertly attended to, in that he draws the grahas for the seasons 2; and now\nthey are covertly attended\n\np. 336\n\nto, in that he draws the Marutvatiya grahas with the two vessels of the\nseasons.\n\n4:3:3:1313\\. He draws (the first) from that (stream of Soma) 1, with (Va _g_.\nS. VII, 35; Rig-veda III, 51, 7), 'O Indra, leader of the Maruts, drink thou\nthe Soma here, as thou drankest of the liquor at (the sacrifice of) the Son of\nSaryati: by thy guidance, in thy protection, O Lord, do the wise serve thee\nwith good offerings!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Marutvat!--\nThis is thy womb: thee to Indra Marutvat!'\n\n4:3:3:1414\\. [The second he draws 2 with Va _g_. S. VII, 36;\n\np. 337\n\n[paragraph continues] Rig-veda III, 47, 5], 'The mighty bull, followed by the\nMaruts, the bountiful, divine ruler Indra,--him, the all-subduing, the\nterrible bestower of victory, do we now invoke for new favour.--Thou art taken\nwith a support: thee to Indra Marutvat!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra\nMarutvat!'--with Thou art\n\np. 338\n\ntaken with a support: thee for the strength of the Maruts!' he draws the third\ncup.\n\n4:3:3:1515\\. Thereupon he draws the Mahendra cup. For Indra was then bound up\nwith evil, in the shape of the people, the Maruts; as one might, for the sake\nof victory, eat from the same vessel with the people 1 so it was when they\ndrew a cup for him in common with the Maruts.\n\n4:3:3:1616\\. When all was conquered and free from danger and injury, the gods\nplucked him from out of all evil--even as one might pluck out a reed from its\nsheath--when they drew the cup for the Great Indra. And even as the reed\nbecomes leafless, so is he thereby freed from all evil, when one draws the\nMahendra cup.\n\n4:3:3:1717\\. And again, why he draws the Mahendra cup. Before the slaughter of\nV _ri_ tra, he was indeed Indra; but when he had slain V _ri_ tra, he became\nthe Great--Indra, even as one who has conquered all around, becomes a Great\nKing (mahara _g_ a): therefore he draws the Mahendra cup. And, moreover, he\nforsooth make's him great for the slaughter of V _ri_ tra therefore also he\ndraws the Mahendra cup. He draws it in the _S_ ukra vessel, for bright ( _s_\nukra) and great indeed is he (the sun) that burns yonder: therefore he draws\nit in the _S_ ukra vessel.\n\n4:3:3:1818\\. He thus draws it from that (Dro _n_ akala _s_ a or Putabh _ri_\nt), with (Va _g_. S. VII, 39; Rig-veda VI, 19, 1), 'Great is Indra and hero-\nlike, gladdening the people, of double stature and unimpaired in power. For\nour sake he waxed strong for heroic deed,--great and broad was he, and\n\np. 339\n\nwell-shapen by the shapers 1.--Thou art taken with a support: thee to\nMahendra!'--with 'This is thy womb: thee to Mahendra!' he deposits it; for it\nis indeed for the Great Indra that he draws it.\n\n4:3:3:1919\\. And having bespoken (the chant 2), he says this\nspeech,--'Pressers, press ye! make the mortars\n\np. 340\n\nresound! Agnidh, stir the sour milk! be thou mindful of Soma's (pap)!' It is\nfor the evening's press-feast that those pressers press out (the Soma juice),\nfor the evening feast they make the mortars resound, for the evening feast the\nAgnidh stirs the sour milk, for the evening feast he boils the pap for Soma.\nFor these two press-feasts, the morning feast and the midday feast, are indeed\nrich in pure Soma, are rich in juice; but that third press-feast is emptied of\nthe pure Soma. Hence he forms it from out of this midday feast; and thus that\nthird press-feast becomes for him rich in pure Soma, rich in juice: this is\nwhy he now speaks that speech.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[331:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_787) 'Iha' (here, hither) with the last syllable\nprotracted. The Hot _ri_ 's cup with the Nigrabhya (vasativari) water having\nbeen handed to the sacrificer, and the fillet or band (ush _n_ isha) with\nwhich the Soma-plants are tied together, to the Gravastut, the pressing is\nperformed in the same way as the 'great pressing,' at p. 332 the Prata _h_\nsavana (see [p. 256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note [1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619)).\nMeanwhile the Gravastut takes the band, and winds it thrice round his head and\nface from left to right. And whenever Soma-stalks are taken out for pressing\nhe extols the stones by chanting the Grava-stotra or 'praise of the stones.'\nAccording to \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. V, 12; Ait. Br. VI, 7, 2, this chant consists of\nthe verses Rig-veda I, 24, 3; V, 81, 1; VIII, 81, 1; VIII, 1, 1, followed by\nthe hymn X, 94, ascribed to the serpent _Ri_ shi Arbuda. Before the last verse\nof this hymn he inserts the hymns X, 76 and X, 175, (ascribed to the serpents\n_G_ aratkar _n_ a and Arbuda respectively); and either before, or between, or\nafter these two hymns he throws in the pavamani _h_ (Rig-veda IX) according to\nrequirement, till the pressing is completed, or the libations are to be drawn,\nwhen having wound up with the last verse of the first Arbuda hymn, he makes\nover the band to the sacrificer. The five cups mentioned in [paragraph\n2](sbe2652.htm#4:3:3:2) are filled from the stream of Soma flowing from the\nHot _ri_ 's cup into the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a; the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a ([p.\n294](sbe2647.htm#page_294), note [2](sbe2647.htm#fn_708)) however being taken\n(in the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a sthali or bowl) from that and two other streams, poured\nby the Unnet _ri_ from the \xc3\x82dhavaniya, and by the Pratiprasthat _ri_ from some\nvessel containing the Soma previously kept in the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a sthali.\n\n[332:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_788) Probably on account of the connection of the B\n_ri_ hat-saman with Indra; see part i, p.196, note 2.\n\n[332:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_789) See [p. 294](sbe2647.htm#page_294), note\n[2](sbe2647.htm#fn_708). Saya _n_ a here curiously explains the term by\n'stotra _n_ i.'\n\n[333:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_790) The Madhyandina-pavamana-stotra, Samav. II, 22-29,\nis made up of three hymns (sukta), consisting of three gayatri (22-24), two b\n_ri_ hati (and satob _ri_ hati, 25, 26), and three trish _t_ ubh verses\n(27-29) respectively. These are chanted in such a way as to produce five Saman\nhymns (i.e. a hymn of three verses), viz. the gayatri triplet is chanted\ntwice, in the Gayatra and \xc3\x82mahiyava tunes;--the b _ri_ hati-satob _ri_ hati\ncouplet is likewise chanted twice, in the Raurava and Yaudha _g_ aya tunes,\nthe two verses being as usual (by the repetition of certain padas) made into\nthree. These, with the addition of the trish _t_ ubh hymn, chanted in the Au\n_s_ ana tune, make five Saman hymns of three verses each, or altogether\nfifteen verses (pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ astoma).\n\n[333:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_791) Or consists of the fifteenfold (chant), as Saya\n_n_ a takes it. Regarding the connection between the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_\na-stoma (the characteristic stoma of the midday pressing) and Indra (the deity\nof the midday pressing), see part i, introd. p. xviii.\n\n[333:3](sbe2652.htm#fr_792) Perhaps graha' has here a double meaning, viz.\n'that which is taken, a draught, cup of Soma,' and 'the taker, seizer.'\n\n[333:4](sbe2652.htm#fr_793) See [p. 289](sbe2646.htm#page_289), note\n[4](sbe2646.htm#fn_700).\n\n[334:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_794) Lit. 'thus;' 'iti _s_ abdenapakrama _n_ aprakaro\n'bhinayena pradar _s_ yate,' Say.\n\n[334:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_795) This passage would seem to be based on a mistaken\ninterpretation of Rig-veda I, 13 5, 8, where the bard says that 'the\nvictorious ( _g_ ayava _h_ ) have come nigh to the a _s_ vattha,' the ' _g_\nayava _h_ ' here evidently referring (not to the Maruts, as in I, 1 19, 3),\nbut to the powerful draughts of Soma flowing into the a _s_ vattha vessel. The\nKa _n_ va text reads, Sa (i.e. vi _s_ , the people or Maruts) ha _s_ vatthe\ntish _th_ ate.\n\n[334:3](sbe2652.htm#fr_796) The Ka _n_ va text inserts 'ity ahu _h_.'\n\n[334:4](sbe2652.htm#fr_797) The context seems to be purposely ambiguous, as it\nmay also be construed thus: They said, 'After putting aside this (cup), we\nwill come (attain) to strength.' Having accordingly put it aside, they came to\nstrength.\n\n[335:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_798) For the construction, see [p.\n33](sbe2607.htm#page_33), note [1](sbe2607.htm#fn_91).\n\n[335:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_799) See [IV, 3, 1, 3](sbe2650.htm#4:3:1:3) seq.\n\n[336:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_800) See [p. 331](sbe2651.htm#page_331), note 2.\n\n[336:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_801) Here the author again anticipates, important parts\nof the performance being not even referred to. On the present occasion only\none Marutvatiya cup is drawn and deposited on the mound (khara). The Ukthya\ncup having then been drawn and deposited, the priests leave the Havirdhana in\nthe same way as at the morning performance (see [IV, 2, 5,\n1](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:1), with note), and perform the Vipru _d_ -homas, or\ndrop-offerings. Thereupon the priests 'creep' (sarp), with their upper bodies\nbent parallel to the ground, to the Sadas, where, near the Udumbara post, the\nchanting of the midday Pavamana-stotra now takes place after the necessary\npreliminaries. If the Pravargya has been performed on the preceding day (see\n[III, 4, 4, 1](sbe2618.htm#3:4:4:1), with note), the Dadhi-gharma, or libation\nof hot milk mixed with sour milk, is now made. Then follow the oblations from\nthe Savaniya-puro _d_ a _s_ a (see [IV, 2, 5, 15](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:15) seq.,\nand [p. 323](sbe2650.htm#page_323), note ). Thereupon filling of the cups of\nthe ten _K_ amasins, and the libations from (and drinking of) the _S_ ukra and\nManthin cups. After the eating of the I _d_ a of the puro _d_ a _s_ as, the\nDakshi _n_ a-homas and distribution of the sacrificial fees take place, as set\nforth in the next Brahma _n_ a. Thereupon the Adhvaryu calls on the Maitravaru\n_n_ a to pronounce the invitatory prayer to Indra Marutvat (viz. Rig-veda III,\n51, 7), 'O Indra, attended by the Maruts, here drink the Soma,' &c., followed\nby the order (praisha), 'Let the Hot _ri_ pronounce the offering prayer to\nIndra Marutvat!' p. 337 The Pratiprasthat _ri_ now draws a second Marutvatiya\ncup in the other Ritu-patra. The offering prayer (Rig-veda III, 47, 2, 'United\nwith the host of Maruts, O Indra, drink the Soma, O wise hero!' &c.) having\nmeanwhile been pronounced by the Hot _ri_ , the Adhvaryu makes libations from\nthe first cup at the Vasha _t_ and Anuvasha _t_. Then pouring the remains of\nthe juice into some other vessel, to be taken to the Sadas, he enters the\nHavirdhana and draws the third Marutvatiya graha with the cup just emptied.\nHaving deposited it, he betakes himself to. the Sadas to drink with the Hot\n_ri_ the remains of the first libation. Thereupon the Hot _ri_ recites the\nMarutvatiya _S_ astra.\n\nThe Marutvatiya Sastra consists of the following parts. After the summons\n(ahava) to the Adhvaryu, and the response (pratigara) of the latter, the Hot\n_ri_ intones the\n\nPratipad (opening triplet), Rig-veda VIII, 57, 1-3, followed by the Anu _k_\nara (sequel), VIII, 2, 1-3.\n\nThen the Indranihava pragatha (VIII, 53, 5) and the Brahma _n_ aspatya\npragatha (I, 40, 5).\n\nThen follow the three Dhayyas (complementary verses), III, 20, 4; I, 91, 2; I,\n64, 6; and the Marutvatiya pragatha, VIII, 89, 3, succeeded by the hymn X, 73,\nthe chief part of the _S_ astra, in the middle of which (after the sixth\nverse), the Nivid ('Let us sing, Om! may Indra with the Maruts drink of the\nSoma,' &c.) is inserted.\n\nHaving recited the last verse (paridhaniya or closing verse) of the hymn, he\nconcludes the _S_ astra by the Ukthavirya, 'Praise has been sung to Indra who\nhears thee!' Thereupon the offering prayer III, 47, 4 is pronounced, and\nlibations are made, both at the Vasha _t_ and Anuvasha _t_ , by the Adhvaryu\nfrom the third, and after him each time, by the Pratiprasthat _ri_ from the\nsecond graha.\n\nThe priests having drank in the Sadas the Soma remaining from the grahas and\nin the _k_ amasas, the Mahendra cup is drawn.\n\n[338:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_802) That is, as a chief, or lord, might do so with a\nclansman (vai _s_ yena, Ka _n_ va text); or as the master of a house with his\nservants.\n\n[339:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_803) Or, according to Ludwig, 'rendered favourable by\nthe performers (priests).'\n\n[339:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_804) That is, the (first) P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra,\nconsisting of the Rathantara-sam an, Samav. II, 30-31. For the way in which\nthe two verses are manipulated (by repetition of the last pada of the first,\nand of the second pada of the second verse), so as to yield a three-versed\nchoral, see Haug, Ait. Br. II, p. 198; Weber, Ind. Stud. VIII, p. 25. These\nchants derive their name from the circumstance that the Samans employed in\nthem are capable of being used as 'p _ri_ sh _th_ as,' that is, of being\nchanted twice with another Saman inserted between them,--or, to speak\nsymbolically, to serve as the womb for the reception of an embryo. For this\npurpose the Rathantara and B _ri_ hat Samans are chiefly used. See note on\n[IV, 5, 4, 13](sbe2663.htm#4:5:4:13). Whenever the P _ri_ sh _th_ as are\nchanted in this way (which they are not at the ordinary Agnish _t_ oma), it is\nchiefly at this very place in the Soma performance, at the midday libation.\nThe chant is succeeded by the recitation, by the Hot _ri_ , of the Nishkevalya\n_S_ astra, consisting of the following parts. The \xc3\x82hava (and pratigara) is\nfollowed by the Stotriya (Rig-veda VII, 32, 22-23, identical with the\nRathantara) and Anurupa (VIII, 3, 7-8) pragathas; then a dhayya, X, 74,.6; the\nSama-pragatha, VIII, 3, 1, and the hymn (to Indra) I, 32, with the Nivid\ninserted in the middle (after the eighth verse). Finally the Hot _ri_\npronounces the Ukthavirya, and the offering prayer, VII, 22, 1, after which\nthe Mahendra libation is poured into the fire.\n\nThen follows the distribution of the Ukthya graha among the three assistants\nof the Hot _ri_ and the recitation of their (nishkevalya) _s_ astras--each\npreceded by a P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra [Samav. II, 32-34 (chanted to the\nVamadevya-saman); 35-36 (Naudhasa); 37-38 (Kaleya) respectively]--as at the\nconclusion of the morning performance; see [p. 295](sbe2647.htm#page_295),\nnote [2](sbe2647.htm#fn_711). Thereupon he addresses the above summons to the\nrespective priests, for the preparations necessary for the evening pressing.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe2653.htm)\n\n"
