It comes in awkwardly and may I think be considered as an\ninterpolation, but I paraphrase a portion of it as a relief after so much\nfighting and carnage, and as an interesting glimpse of the monotheistic ideas\nwhich underlie the Hindu religion. The hymn does not readily lend itself to\nmetrical translation, and I have not attempted here to give a faithful\nrendering of the whole. A literal version of the text and the commentary given\nin the Calcutta edition will be found in the Additional Notes.\n\nA canto is here omitted. It contains fighting of the ordinary kind between\nRama and Ravan, and a description of sights and sounds of evil omen foreboding\nthe destruction of the giant.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto CVIII.: The Battle.](ry479.htm)\n\n"
