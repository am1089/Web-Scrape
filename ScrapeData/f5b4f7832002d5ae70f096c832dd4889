Always gliding near with soft feet,  \nHave none chanted for Thee a chant of fullest welcome?  \n                           _Walt Whitman_.\n\np. 25\n\nIT may have been that the fore-fathers saw it in the mountains. Or it may have\nbeen elsewhere. Somewhere it came to the Hindu mind that the beauty of\nsnowpeaks and moonlight, and standing water, was different from all other\nloveliness of colour and profusion and many-channelled scene.\n\nIt was as though Nature, the great Mother, were clothed in raiment of green,\nbroidered with birds and flowers and fruits, and veiled in blue, adorned with\nmany jewels, and yet as if, amidst all the restless pomp and clamour of her\nglory, would shine through now and then, a hint of something different.\nSomething white and austere and pure; something compelling quiet; something\nsilent and passionless, and eternally alone. Even the beauty of the world,\nthen, suggested a twofold essence. Wherever the Hindu looked, he found this\nduality repeated,--light and shadow, attraction and repulsion, microcosm and\nmacrocosm, cause and effect. Nay, he looked into human life\n\np. 26\n\nitself, and he found humanity as man and woman, soul and body.\n\nHere was a clue. On the plane of symbolism, the soul of things somehow became\nassociated with the manly form, and the manifested energy (Nature, as we call\nit) with that of woman and motherhood. In this conception will be noted the\ndeliberate statement that God and Nature are necessary to each other as the\ncomplementary manifestations of One, just as we find in the male and the\nfemale together, Humanity. That is to say, Nature itself is God, as truly as\nNature\'s soul. "Are God and Nature then at strife?" cries, not only a great\npoet, but the whole heart of our western religion to-day. And far back from\nout of the dim centuries comes the hushed whisper of the Indian sages--"Look\ncloser, brother! they are not even two, but one!" Under this aspect, the One\nExistence is known as Purush and Prakriti, Soul and Energy.\n\nThe highest representation of the Divine is always human. The\n\np. 27\n\nshadow of a great rock in a weary land is a beautiful presentment of some\nimaginary qualities of God, but not for one moment does it delude the mind\ninto the belief that here at last it has the thing itself. So with the Light\nand the Door, the Mountain and the Shield. These were not images that could\ntake captive both brain and heart, firing a man to die in their defence. Very\ndifferent was it with those other pictures, the Good Shepherd, the Eternal\nFather!\n\nHere a strange mental confusion is imminent. The mystery behind all form is at\nlast named in a formula so convincing, so appealing, so satisfying, that\ndistinction ceases; we forget that even this is not final, that beyond the\nexpression, and apart from it, lies the whole immensity.\n\nHinduism has avoided this danger of fixedness in a very curious way. Of all\nthe peoples of the earth, it might be claimed that Hindus are apparently the\nmost, and at heart the least, idolatrous. For the\n\np. 28\n\napplication of their symbols is many-centred, like the fire in opals.\n\nThis Purush and Prakriti utters a great principle. The relation of God to\nNature is one demonstration of it. The soul and experience offer us another.\nThe dynamo and the force that charges it would be a third.\n\nThis last illustration deserves a moment\'s attention. Everywhere we see the\nphenomenon of one waiting to be touched by another, in order to manifest power\nand activity. The two are known in India as Siva and Sakti. As the knight\nwaits for the sight of his own lady, powerless without the inspiration of her\ntouch, as the disciple waits for the master, and finds in him at last the\nmeaning of all his life before, so the soul lies inert, passive, unstirred by\nthe external, till the great moment comes, and it looks up at the shock of\nsome divine catastrophe, to know in a flash that the whole of the without,--\nthe whole of life, and time, and nature,\n\np. 29\n\nand experience--like the within, is also God.\n\nIt is the beatific vision, says the West: it is realisation of the Self, here\nand now, declares the East.\n\nOf such a moment is the Kali image symbol--the soul opening its eyes upon the\nworld and seeing God.\n\nWe have seen that anthropomorphic representation of the Divine is absolutely\nnecessary to human nature. But to learn the manner and method of that\nexpression, we must know the whole heart and feeling of a people. To us, ideal\nmanhood includes the king, the master, and the father. He must be supreme. He\ngoes forth before His armies as general and sovereign. He counts the very\nhairs of His children\'s heads. He avenges their wrongs, and He protects from\npestilence. He owns the vineyard of the world, and Himself prunes and cares\nfor the chosen vine. Perfect in love, perfect in administration, perfect\n\np. 30\n\nin power: ideal householder, ideal judge, ideal ruler. Such is the\nanthropomorphism of the West.\n\nHow strangely different is that of India! There, life has one test, one\nstandard, and one alone. Does a man know God or not? That is all. No question\nof fruits, no question of activity, no question of happiness. Only--has the\nsoul set out on the quest of realisation?\n\nHow literally this is the one passion we may see in popular drama. There, the\nromantic motive is of no account. That Jack should have his Joan (or not have\nher) is a mere incident, passed over with no superfluous words, at the\nbeginning of things. But we sit for hours absorbed, enthralled, to know--when\nshall these men attain to God? Or even, when shall they discover that nothing\nbut God is worth the having?\n\nAnd of this stage of developement, renunciation is accepted as the outward\nsign. For in that moment when the red rose of the love of God springs and\nblossoms in a\n\np. 31\n\nman\'s heart,--so that he cries out: "Like as the hart panteth after the\nwaterbrooks, so longeth my soul after Thee O God!"--in that moment, as Asia\nknows well, everything else falls away from him. All the manifold\nsatisfactions of the flesh become a burden. Home and kindred and intercourse\nwith the world are a bondage. Food and sleep and the necessities of the\nphysical life seem indifferent or intolerable. And so it comes that the Great\nGod of the Hindu imagination is a beggar. Covered with the ashes of His\nsacrificial fire, so that He is white like snow, His hair growing untended in\nhuge masses, oblivious of cold or heat, silent, remote from men, He sits\nabsorbed in eternal meditation.\n\nThose human eyes of His are half closed. Though worlds are uttered and\ndestroyed with every breath, it is nothing to Him. All comes and goes before\nHim like a dream. Such is the meaning of the curious unrealism of the image.\n\np. 32\n\n[paragraph continues] But one faculty is all activity. Within it has been\nindrawn all the force of all the senses. Upright in the middle of the forehead\nlooks forth the third eye, the eye of inner vision. It is natural then, that\nSiva the Great God, set forth as ideal manhood, should be known amongst other\nnames as the Wondrous-Eyed.\n\nHe is the Refuge of Animals. About His neck have wound the serpents, whom none\nelse would receive.\n\nNever did he turn any away. The mad and the eccentric, the crazed, and the\nqueer, and the half-witted amongst men--for all these there is room with Siva.\nHis love will embrace even the demoniac.\n\nHe accepts that which all else reject. All the pain and evil of the Universe\nHe took as His share, to save the world, when He drank the poison of things,\nand made His throat blue for ever.\n\nHe possesses so little! Only the old bull on which he rides, and the\n\np. 33\n\ntiger-skin of meditation, and a string or two of praying beads--no more.\n\nAnd, last of all, He is so easily pleased! Could any trait be so exquisite as\nthis? Only pure water and a few grains of rice, and a green leaf or two may be\noffered to Him daily, for the Great God in matters of this world is very very\nsimple, and sets no store by things for which we struggle and lie and slay our\nfellow men. Such is the picture that springs to the Indian mind, as\nrepresenting the Soul of the Universe--Siva, the All-Merciful, the Destroyer\nof Ignorance, the Great God. Such is the form in which are uttered finally\nthose first faint suggestions of the light of Himalayan snow peaks and the new\nmoon shining on still waters. Perfect renunciation, perfect withdrawnness,\nperfect absorption in eternity,--these things alone are worthy to be told\nconcerning Him Who is "the Sweetest of the Sweet, the most Terrible of the\nTerrible, the Lord of Heroes, and the Wondrous-Eyed."\n\np. 34\n\nListen to the prayer that rises to Him daily from many a worshipper, through\nthe length and breadth of India:--\n\n"From the Unreal lead us to the Real,  \nFrom Darkness lead us unto Light,  \nFrom Death lead us to Immortality.  \nReach us through and through ourself,  \nAnd evermore protect us,  \nO Thou Terrible!--from ignorance,  \nBy Thy sweet compassionate face."\n\nSuch is Siva--ideal of Manhood, embodiment of Godhead.\n\n\n\nAs the Purush, or Soul, He is Consort and Spouse of Maya, Nature, the fleeting\ndiversity of sense. It is in this relation that we find Him beneath the feet\nof Kali. His recumbent posture signifies inertness, the Soul untouched and\nindifferent to the external. Kali has been executing a wild dance of carnage.\nOn all sides She has left evidences of Her reign of terror. The garland of\nskulls is round her neck; still in Her hands She holds the bloody weapon and a\nfreshly-severed head. Suddenly She has\n\np. 35\n\nstepped unwittingly on the body of Her Husband. Her foot is on His breast. He\nhas looked up, awakened by that touch, and They are gazing into each other\'s\neyes. Her right hands are raised in involuntary blessing, and Her tongue makes\nan exaggerated gesture of shyness and surprise, once common to Indian women of\nthe villages.\n\nAnd He, what does He see? To Him, She is all beauty--this woman nude and\nterrible and black, who tells the name of God on the skulls of the dead, who\ncreates the blood-shed on which demons fatten, who slays rejoicing and repents\nnot, and blesses Him only that lies crushed beneath Her feet.\n\nHer mass of black hair flows behind Her like the wind, or like time, "the\ndrift and passage of things." But to the great third eye even time is one, and\nthat one, God. She is blue almost to blackness, like a mighty shadow, and bare\nlike the dread realities of life and death. But for Him there is no shadow.\nDeep into the heart\n\np. 36\n\nof that Most Terrible, He looks unshrinking, and in the ecstasy of recognition\nHe calls Her _Mother_. So shall ever be the union of the soul with God.\n\n\n\nDo we understand what the background is from which such a thought as this\ncould spring? For the Kali-image is not so much a picture of the deity, as the\nutterance of the secret of our own lives.\n\nThe soul in realisation beholds the mother--how? The picture of green lawns\nand smiling skies, and flowers steeped in sunshine, cannot deceive the All-\nKnower. Under the apparent loveliness, He sees life preying on life, the\nrivers breaking down the mountains, the comet poised in mid-space to strike.\nAround him rises up the wail of all the creatures, the moan of pain, and the\nsob of greed, and the pitiful cry of little things in fear. Irresponsible,\nwithout mercy, seems the spirit of time--deaf to the woes of man, or answering\nthem only with a peal of laughter.\n\np. 37\n\nSuch is the world as the Hindu mind is predisposed to see it. "Verily," says\nthe heart wearily, "Death is greater than Life, yea and better!"\n\nNot so the supreme soul in its hour of vision! No coward\'s sigh of exhaustion,\nno selfish prayer for mercy, no idle resignation there! Bend low, and you\nshall hear the answer that India makes to the Eternal Motherhood, through all\nher ages of torture and despair. Listen well, for the voice is low that\nspeaks, and the crash of ruin mighty:\n\n"Though Thou slay me, _yet_ will I trust in Thee!" After all, has anyone of us\nfound God in any other form than in this--the Vision of Siva? Have not the\ngreat intuitions of our life all come to us in moments when the cup was\nbitterest? Has it not always been with sobs of desolation that we have seen\nthe Absolute triumphant in Love?\n\nBehold we also, O Mother, are Thy children! Though Thou Slay us, yet will we\ntrust in Thee!\n\np. 38\n\n.      .      .      .      .      .\n\nThe hour is gone, and the vision is passed away, the vision of the greatest\nsymbol, perhaps, that man has ever imagined for himself. The hour is past, and\nwe are back amongst the mountains in the early ages.\n\nThere is a gathering of the tribes for a Vedic sacrifice. Yonder, the bull\nmajestically paces towards us, laden with wood for the sacrificial fire.\n\nNow it is lighted, and from the central mass rises the blue-throated flame,\nwhile round the edge, leaving the fuel black and charred, curl those greedy\nred tongues of fire, to each of which the wise men give its separate name--the\nBlack, the Terrible, and so on. The priests chant texts, and the people wait\nupon the worship. And we see faces-in-the-fire of the time to he, when the\neyes of the poet shall rest upon the sacrifice, and shall fashion therefrom\nthis mighty vision of God and nature, the soul and life.\n\np. 39\n\nFor scholars say that Siva is but the fire of Vedic rites personified. He is\nthe wood borne upon the bull, and the flame which is white, with a patch of\nblue colour at the throat.\n\nAs for Kali, She, it is claimed, was one of His powers, one of the red licking\nflames, which char and blacken the wood that is not consumed. In token of\nwhich we see to this day Her protruding tongue.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Two Saints of Kali](ktm04.htm)\n\n'
