There are four kinds of Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, viz. the huta, the ahuta,\nthe prahuta, and the pra _s_ ita.\n\n2\\. On the following five occasions, viz. the wedding, the tonsure (of the\nchild's head), the initiation (of the Brahma _k_ arin), the cutting of the\nbeard, and the parting of the hair, (on these occasions) in the outer hall,\n\n3\\. On a place that has been smeared (with cow-dung), which is elevated, and\nwhich has been sprinkled (with water), he establishes the fire,\n\np. 277\n\n4\\. Having kindled it by attrition, according to some teachers, at his\nmarriage.\n\n5\\. During the northern course of the sun, in the time of the increasing moon,\non an auspicious day he shall seize the hand of a girl,\n\n6 6. Under one of the (three times) three Nakshatras of which a constellation\ndesignated as Uttara is first,\n\n7\\. Or under (the Nakshatras) Svati, M _ri_ ga _s_ iras, or Rohi _n_ i.\n\n8\\. Three (wives are allowed) to a Brahma _n_ a, in accordance with the order\nof the castes,\n\n9\\. Two to a Ra _g_ anya,\n\n10\\. One to a Vai _s_ ya,\n\n11\\. One _S_ udra wife besides to all, according to some (teachers), without\nusing Mantras (at the ceremonies of wedding, &c.).\n\n12 12. He then makes her put on the (under) garment with (the verse), 'Live to\nold age; put on the garment! Be a protectress of the human tribes against\nimprecation. Live a hundred years full of vigour; clothe thyself in wealth and\nchildren. Blessed with life put on this garment!'\n\n13 13. Then the upper garment with (the verse), 'The goddesses who spun, who\nwove, who spread\n\np. 278\n\nout, and who drew out the threads on both sides, may those goddesses clothe\nthee for the sake of long life. Blessed with life put on this garment!'\n\n14 14. (The bride's father?) anoints the two, (while the bridegroom recites\nthe verse,) 'May the Vi _s_ ve devas, may the waters unite our hearts. May\nMatari _s_ van, may Dhat _ri_ , may Desh _t_ ri (the 'showing' goddess) join\nus.'\n\n15\\. (The bridegroom), having accepted her who is given away by her father,\ntakes her and goes away (from that place) with (the verse), 'When thou\nwanderest far away with thy heart to the regions of the world like the wind,\nmay the gold-winged Vaikar _n_ a (i.e. the wind?) grant that thy heart may\ndwell with me! N.N.!'\n\n16 16. He then makes them look at each other (while the bridegroom repeats the\nverses), 'With no evil eye, not bringing death to thy husband, bring luck to\nthe cattle, be full of joy and vigour. Give birth to heroes; be godly and\nfriendly. Bring us luck, to men and animals.\n\n'Soma has acquired (thee) first (as his wife); after him the Gandharva has\nacquired (thee). Thy third husband is Agni; the fourth is thy human husband.\n\np. 279\n\n'Soma has given thee to the Gandharva; the Gandharva has given thee to Agni.\nWealth and children Agni has given to me, and besides this wife.\n\n'Pushan! Lead her to us, the highly blessed one.

Thus the\nuse of the masculine abhi _s_ astipava with reference to the bride may be\naccounted for.\n\n[277:13](sbe29158.htm#fr_696) Comp. Atharva-veda XIV, 1, 45. This parallel\npassage shows us the way to correct the text of this very much corrupted\nMantra.\n\n[278:14](sbe29158.htm#fr_697) The literal translation would be: 'He salves\ntogether (sama _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ayati) the two . . . May the waters salve together\n(sama _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ antu) our hearts.' It was a real anointing of the bridegroom and\nof the bride, that took place, and we cannot accept Professor Stenzler's\ntranslation (based on _G_ ayarama's note: sama _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ayati paraspara _m_\nsammukhikaroti), by which the proper signification of sama _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ayati is\neffaced: Dann heisst (der Vater der Braut) sie beide zusammentreten. See the\nnote on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I, 12, 5. The parallel passage of the\nKhadira-G _ri_ hya runs thus: apare _n_ agnim auduko gatva pa _n_ igraha _m_\nmurdhany avasi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ed, vadhu _m_ _k_ a, sama _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ antv ity avasikta\n_h_.\n\n[278:16](sbe29158.htm#fr_698) Comp.
