For now, having laid down the fourth\nlayer, the gods mounted it,--having completed what is above the air, and below\nthe sky, they mounted it.\n\n8:5:1:22\\. They spake, 'Meditate ye ( _k_ etay)!' whereby, doubtless, they\nmeant to say, 'Seek ye a layer ( _k_ iti)! Seek ye from hence upwards!' Whilst\nmeditating, they saw that fifth layer, the far-shining heaven: that world\npleased them.\n\n8:5:1:33\\. They desired, 'Would that we could make that world foeless,\nundisturbed!' They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how we shall make this world\n\np. 83\n\nfoeless, undisturbed!' They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed, they meant\nto say, 'Seek ye a layer! Seek ye how we shall make this world foeless,\nundisturbed!'\n\n8:5:1:44\\. Whilst meditating, they saw these Asapatna ('foeless') bricks; they\nlaid them down, and by means of them they made that world foeless,\nundisturbed; and because by means of them they made that world foeless,\nundisturbed, these (are called) Asapatnas. And in like manner does the\nSacrificer, by laying them down, now make that world foeless, undisturbed. On\nall (four) sides he lays them down: on all sides he thus makes that world\nfoeless, undisturbed. He places them on the other side: he thereby makes that\nwhole world foe-less, undisturbed.\n\n8:5:1:55\\. He then lays down the Vira _g_ s 1 (far-shining bricks): this Vira\n_g_ , indeed, is that far-shining (vira _g_ ) fifth layer which the gods saw.\nHe lays them down by tens: the Vira _g_ (metre) consists of ten syllables, and\nthis layer is 'vira _g_.' He places them on every side; for he who shines\n(rules) in one direction only, does not shine far and wide, but whosoever\nshines in all directions, he alone shines far and wide.\n\n8:5:1:66\\. And as to why he lays down those Asapatnas. Now at that time, when\nthat (part) of his body had been restored, evil beset Pra _g_ apati on every\nside. He saw those foeless bricks, and laid them down, and by means of them he\ndrove off evil, for foe means evil; and because, by means of them he drove off\nthe foe, evil, therefore they are (called) 'foeless' (bricks).\n\np. 84\n\n8:5:1:77\\. And what the gods did, the same is done now. Evil, indeed, does not\nnow beset this (Sacrificer), but when he now does this, it is that he wants to\ndo what the gods did; and he thereby drives off whatever evil, whatever foe\nbesets him; and because, by means of them, he drives off the foe, evil,\ntherefore they are (called) the 'foeless' (bricks). He places them on every\nside: he thereby drives off the foe, evil, on every side. He places them on\nthe other side: from his whole self he thereby drives off the foe, evil.\n\n8:5:1:88\\. He lays down (one) in front 1, with (Va _g_. S. XV, 1), 'O Agni,\ndrive away the foes of ours that are born, drive back those unborn, O knower\nof beings! cheer us, kindly and un-frowning! may we be in thy threefold-\nsheltering, steadfast protection!' as the text so the sense. Then behind, with\n(Va _g_. S. XV, 2), 'With might drive away the foes of ours that are born,\n\np. 85\n\ndrive back, O knower of beings, those unborn! cheer us with kindly feeling!\nmay we prevail! drive off our foes!' as the text so the sense.\n\n8:5:1:99\\. That which is (placed) in front is Agni, and that behind is Agni:\nwith Agni he (Pra _g_ apati) then drove away evil both in front and in the\nrear; and in like manner now does the Sacrificer with Agni drive away evil\nboth in front and in the rear.\n\n8:5:1:1010\\. Then on the right (south) side, with (Va _g_. S. XV, 3), 'The\nsixteenfold Stoma, vigour, wealth!' The Trish _t_ ubh consists of eleven\nsyllables, and--the air being of Trish _t_ ubh nature--there are (in the air)\nfour quarters. The thunderbolt is fifteenfold, and yonder sun is the\nsixteenfold wielder of that thunderbolt: with that thunderbolt, with that\nTrish _t_ ubh, he (Pra _g_ apati) drove away evil in the south; and in like\nmanner does the Sacrificer, with that thunderbolt, with that Trish _t_ ubh,\nnow drive away evil in the south.\n\n8:5:1:1111\\. Then on the left (north) side, with, 'The forty-four-fold Stoma,\nlustre, wealth!' The Trish _t_ ubh consists of forty-four syllables, and the\nthunderbolt is of Trish _t_ ubh nature: with that forty-four-fold thunderbolt,\nwith that Trish _t_ ubh, he (Pra _g_ apati) drove away evil in the north; and\nin like manner does the Sacrificer, with that thunderbolt, with that Trish _t_\nubh, now drive away evil in the north.\n\n8:5:1:1212\\. Then in the middle (the fifth), with, 'Agni's soil-cover thou\nart!'--the fourth layer indeed is the Brahman, and the Brahman is Agni, and\nthis, the fifth layer is, as it were, the (soil-)cover of that (fourth\nlayer);--'his sap, in truth: may the All-gods sing thy praises! Seat thee\nhere, laden with Stomas, and rich in fat! Gain for us, by\n\np. 86\n\nsacrifice, wealth with offspring!' as the text so the sense.\n\n8:5:1:1313\\. This one he lays down with its line-marks running eastward and\ncrosswise 1; for by that one Pra _g_ apati then cut out the root of evil, and\nin like manner does this (Sacrificer) now thereby cut out the root of evil. On\nthe right (south) side (from the centre he places it), for the thunderbolt has\na string 2 on the right side;--inside the one in the southern quarter, for it\nis for the sake of extension that he leaves that space.\n\n8:5:1:1414\\. The one which (lies) in front is the out-breathing, the one at\nthe back the off-breathing: by the out-breathing he (Pra _g_ apati) then drove\naway evil in front, and by the off-breathing in the rear; and in like manner\ndoes the Sacrificer now by the out-breathing drive away evil in front, and by\nthe off-breathing in the rear.\n\n8:5:1:1515\\. And the two on both sides (of the spine) are the two arms:\nwhatever evil there was sideways of him, that he drove away with his arms; and\nin like manner does this Sacrificer now drive away with his arms whatever evil\nthere is sideways of him.\n\np. 87\n\n8:5:1:1616\\. The soil-bedded one 1 means food: whatever evil there was above\nhim, that he (Pra _g_ apati) drove away by means of food; and in like manner\ndoes the Sacrificer now, by means of food, drive away whatever evil there is\nabove him.\n\n8:5:1:1717\\. And, verily, whenever he, knowing this, breathes out, he thereby\ndrives away the evil which is in front of him; and when he breathes backward,\nhe thereby (drives away) that which is in the rear; and when he does work with\nhis arms, he thereby (drives away) that which is sideways of him; and when he\neats food, he thereby (drives away) that (evil) which is above him: at all\ntimes, indeed, even while sleeping, does he who knows this drive away evil.\nHence, one must not speak ill of him who knows this, lest one should be his\nevil (enemy).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[83:1](sbe4319.htm#fr_169) For particulars respecting these, also called _Kh_\nandasya _h_ , see [VIII, 5, 2, 1](sbe4320.htm#8:5:2:1), seq.\n\n[84:1](sbe4319.htm#fr_170) The first four of the five Asapatnas are laid down\nnear the four ends of the spines (in the order east, west, south, north);\ntheir exact place being the second space on the left side of the spine (in\nlooking towards them from the centre), that is to say, the space of one (? or\nhalf a) foot being left between them and the respective spine. Their position\nthus is the same as those of the \xc3\x82 _s_ vinis in the second layer (see [p.\n31](sbe4308.htm#page_31), note [1](sbe4308.htm#fn_85)) except that these were\nplaced on the Reta _h_ si _k_ range instead of at the ends of the spines. The\nline-marks of these four bricks run parallel to the respective spines. The\nfifth Asapatna is thus laid down north of the southern one, so as to leave the\nspace of a cubit (about a foot and a half) between them. These latter two\nAsapatnas are full-sized bricks (one foot square), and not half-sized, as were\nthe two southern \xc3\x82 _s_ vinis. Moreover, whilst the southern Asapatna has its\nline-marks running parallel to the adjoining cross-spine (south to north), the\nfifth Asapatna has them running from west to east (? as well as from south to\nnorth).\n\n[86:1](sbe4319.htm#fr_171) That is to say, crosswise, or marked in the\nopposite direction to the Asapatna brick near it, viz. to the one placed east\nof the southern end of the cross-spine which (like all bricks placed between\nshoulder and thigh) has its line-marks running from south to north. The fifth\nAsapatna, lying immediately north of that southern one, thus has its line-\nmarks parallel, not (as one would expect) to the cross-spine, but to the\nfurther removed spine.\n\n[86:2](sbe4319.htm#fr_172) This is a doubtful rendering of 'udyama,' which is\naccepted by the St. Petersb. Dict. for 'sha _d_ -udyama,' at VI, 7, 1, 16, 18;\nwhilst in the present case 'dakshi _n_ ata-udyama' seems to be taken by it to\nmean southward erected, southward drawn (aufgespannt).' Udyama,' in the sense\n'extension,' might mean a protruding part, serving as a handle.\n\n[87:1](sbe4319.htm#fr_173) That is, the fifth Asapatna, which has a bed or\nlayer of loose soil (purisha) spread under it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII. 5, 2.
