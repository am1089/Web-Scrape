He proceeds with (the offering of) Soma's rice-pap; for Soma is the\nsacrificial food of the gods; and here now sacrificial food is prepared for\nSoma on his part; and thus Soma is not excluded therefrom. It is a rice-pap (\n_k_ aru), for rice-pap is food for the gods, since rice-pap is boiled rice,\nand boiled rice is clearly food: therefore it is a rice-pap.\n\n4:4:2:22\\. Neither at the morning feast, nor at the midday feast does he offer\nit, for those two press-feasts, the morning feast and the midday feast, are\nthe exclusive feasts of the gods; and Soma is sacred to the Fathers 1.\n\n4:4:2:33\\. But were he to offer it at the morning feast, or at the midday\nfeast, he would cause discord between the gods and Fathers. He offers it at\nthe evening feast, because the evening feast belongs to the All-gods 2: thus\nhe does not cause discord. He recites no invitatory prayer (but only an\noffering prayer), for the Fathers have passed away once for all: hence he\nrecites no invitatory prayer.\n\n4:4:2:44\\. Having, in the first place, taken ghee in four ladlings, and having\ncalled (on the Agnidh) for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says, 'Recite the offering\nprayer of the ghee!' and offers as the Vasha _t_ is uttered. Whatever\noblations have been offered previous to this ( _k_ aru), therefrom he\nseparates this one (to Soma), and thus he causes no discord.\n\np. 364\n\n4:4:2:55\\. Having poured (into the spoon) an 'underlayer' of ghee, he makes\ntwo cuttings from the rice-pap; and bastes them with ghee above. Having called\nfor the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says, 'Recite the offering prayer of the Saumya\n(rice-pap)!' and offers as the Vasha _t_ is uttered.\n\n4:4:2:66\\. He then takes ghee a second time by four ladlings, and having\ncalled for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says, 'Recite the offering prayer of the\nghee!' and offers as the Vasha _t_ is uttered. From whatever oblations he\nintends to offer hereafter, he thereby separates this one (to Soma), and thus\nhe causes no discord. If he chooses, he may offer (ghee) on both sides (before\nand after the Soma's rice-pap); or, if he chooses, he may offer on one side\nonly 1.\n\n4:4:2:77\\. Now there is an offering-spoon called 'pra _k_ ara _n_ i.' Therein\nthe Adhvaryu takes ghee by four ladlings (with the dipping-spoon) and pours it\non the Dhish _n_ ya hearths by means of fagots (held over them). The reason\nwhy he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots is this. Because, on a\nformer occasion 2, the gods said to those (Gandharva\n\np. 365\n\n[paragraph continues] Soma-wardens), 'At the third pressing an offering of\nghee shall fall to your share, but not one of Soma, for the Soma-draught has\nbeen taken from you, wherefore ye are not worthy of a Soma-offering,' that\nsame offering of ghee now falls to their share at the evening pressing, but\nnot one of Soma, in that he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots. One\nafter another, in the order in which they were thrown up, and with the same\nformulas 1, he pours ghee upon them; on the Mar _g_ aliya last of all.\n\n4:4:2:88\\. Now some make a second pouring on the \xc3\x82gnidhriya hearth, thinking,\n'In the North (or upwards) shall this sacred work of ours be accomplished!'\nbut let him not do it in this way, but rather the Mar _g_ aliya last 2.\n\n4:4:2:99\\. Now, while the Adhvaryu pours ghee on the hearths by means of\nfagots, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ draws the Patnivata 3 cup. For from the\nsacrifice creatures are produced; and being produced from the sacrifice, they\nare produced from union; and being produced from union, they are produced from\nthe hind part of the sacrifice;--hence he thereby produces them from a\nproductive union, from the hind part of the sacrifice: therefore he draws the\nPatnivata cup.\n\n4:4:2:1010\\. He draws it with the Upa _m_ _s_ u vessel. If he\n\np. 366\n\ndraws the Savitra libation with the Upa _m_ _s_ u vessel, (he draws) this one\nwith the Antaryama vessel; and if he draws the Savitra with the Antaryama\nvessel (he draws) this one with the Upa _m_ _s_ u vessel;--for one and the\nsame indeed are the Upa _m_ _s_ u and Antaryama, being breath, and that which\nis the out-breathing is also the in-breathing. Now the breath (pra _n_ a,\nmasc.) is male, and the wife is female: a productive union is thus brought\nabout.\n\n4:4:2:1111\\. He draws it without a puroru _k_  1,---the puroru _k_ being\nmanhood,--lest he should bestow manhood on women: therefore he draws it\nwithout a puroru _k_.\n\n4:4:2:1212\\. He thus draws it from that (\xc3\x82graya _n_ a graha) with (Va _g_. S.\nVIII, 9), 'Thou art taken with a support: Of thee, divine Soma, begotten by B\n_ri_ haspati'--B _ri_ haspati is the priesthood: of thee, divine Soma, the\npriest-begotten' he thereby means to say--'Of thee, the potent juice of the\npowerful (manly) juice' he means to say when he says 'of thee, the potent\njuice'--'May I prosper the draughts of thee, the mated one 2!' he does not now\ndraw it for the wives, lest he should bestow manhood on women: therefore he\ndoes not now draw it for the wives.\n\n4:4:2:1313\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then mixes it with the residue (of ghee) which\nis left in the pra _k_ ara _n_ i spoon. Now other libations he completes by\nmixing, but this one he diminishes; for ghee is a thunderbolt,\n\np. 367\n\nand by that thunderbolt, the ghee, the gods smote the wives and unmanned them,\nand thus smitten and unmanned they neither owned any self nor did they own any\nheritage. And in like manner does he now, by that thunderbolt, the ghee, smite\nthe wives and unman them; and thus smitten and unmanned, they neither own 1\nany self nor do they own any heritage.\n\n4:4:2:1414\\. He mixes it, with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 9), 'I am above, I am below;\nand what space there is between, that was my father;--I saw the sun on both\nsides: I am what is highest to the gods in secret.' In that he mixes with 'I--\nI,' thereby he bestows manhood on men.\n\n4:4:2:1515\\. He then says, 'Agnidh, pronounce the offering prayer of the\nPatnivata!' The Agnidh is male, and the wife is female: thus a productive\nunion is brought about. He offers with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 10), 'O Agni, wife-\nleader 2!'--Agni is male, and the wife is female: thus a productive union is\nbrought about.\n\n4:4:2:1616\\. 'Together with the divine Tvash _t_ _ri_ '--for Tvash _t_ _ri_\ntransforms the cast seed: thus he thereby transforms the cast seed;--'drink\nthe Soma, Hail!' therewith he offers on the north (left) part (of the fire);\nwhat other offerings there are, they are the gods, and these are the wives:\nthus alone it is a proper union, since the woman lies on the left (north) side\nof the man. The Adhvaryu takes a draught of Soma to the Agnidh, and the latter\nsays, 'Adhvaryu, invite me!' [It might be said\n\np. 368\n\nthat] he should not invite him, since how can there be an invitation of one\nsmitten and unmanned? He should nevertheless invite him: they offer in his\nfire, and utter the Vasha _t_ ,--therefore he should invite him.\n\n4:4:2:1717\\. He then gives orders, 'Agnidh, sit in the Nesh _t_ _ri_ 's lap!\nNesh _t_ _ri_ , lead up the lady, and make her exchange looks with the Udgat\n_ri_! Unnet _ri_ , fill up the Hot _ri_ 's cup, and let no Soma-juice remain!'\nThus, if it be an Agnish _t_ oma sacrifice.\n\n4:4:2:1818\\. But if it be an Ukthya 1, let him say, 'Lengthen out the Soma!'--\nHolding the same vessel (from which the Patnivata libation was made, the\nAgnidh) sits down in the Nesh _t_ _ri_ 's lap,--for he, the Agnidh, is in\nreality Agni, and the Nesh _t_ _ri_ is female: the Agnidh is male, and the\nNesh _t_ _ri_ female,--a productive union is thus brought about. The Nesh _t_\n_ri_ leads up the lady and makes her exchange looks with the Udgat _ri_  2,\nwith 'Thou art Pra _g_ apati, the\n\np. 369\n\nmale, the bestower of seed: lay thou seed into me!' The Udgat _ri_ is Pra _g_\napati, and the lady is a woman: a productive union is thus brought about.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[363:1](sbe2656.htm#fr_848) Probably, because Soma is slain in being\nsacrificed (see [IV, 3, 4, 1](sbe2653.htm#4:3:4:1)), and therefore belongs to\nthe Fathers or Departed Spirits.\n\n[363:2](sbe2656.htm#fr_849) And the All-gods (or all he gods) mean everything.\nSee [IV, 4, 1, 4](sbe2655.htm#4:4:1:4).\n\n[364:1](sbe2656.htm#fr_850) The homa of ghee, made-before the rice-pap\noblation to Soma, belongs to Agni, and the one made after the oblation, to\nVish _n_ u. If only one homa be made, it belongs to Agni and Vish _n_ u. The\nKa _n_ va text reads, 'Tad va ahur anyatarata eva pariya _g_ et purastad\neveti,' now they say, 'He should offer on one side only, and that in front\n(previously to the _k_ aru).' For the offering formulas, see \xc3\x82 _s_ v. V, 19,\n3; Ait. Br. III, 32. After the completion of these offerings, the Adhvaryu\npours ordinary ghee on the rice-pap and presents it to the Hot _ri_ , who\nlooks at it while pronouncing some formulas (\xc3\x82 _s_ v. V, 19, 4, 5), and he\nsmears his eyes with the ghee on the pap, after which the latter is handed to\nthe chanters (udgat _ri_ ) to be eaten by them.\n\n[364:2](sbe2656.htm#fr_851) See [III, 6, 2, 19](sbe2624.htm#3:6:2:19).\n\n[365:1](sbe2656.htm#fr_852) Viz., Va _g_. S. V, 31, 32. The \xc3\x82gnidhra hearth is\nprepared first, and the Mar _g_ aliya last of the eight dhish _n_ yas. See [p.\n148](sbe2623.htm#page_148), note [4](sbe2624.htm#fn_392).\n\n[365:2](sbe2656.htm#fr_853) Or, uppermost (uttamam; the Ka _n_ vas read\n'antamam').\n\n[365:3](sbe2656.htm#fr_854) The meaning of the term patnivata is 'relating to\nthe patnivant (i.e. wived or mated one),' the 'patnivant' being probably Soma\nwith the water mixed with it; or Agni with the wives of the gods, (with\nspecial reference to the sacrificer's wife); cf. Taitt. S. VI, 5, 8, I, 2.\nAccording to the Ka _n_ va text, Agni associated with the goddess Speech (Va\n_k_ patni) seems to be understood.\n\n[366:1](sbe2656.htm#fr_855) See [p. 268](sbe2642.htm#page_268), note\n[1](sbe2642.htm#fn_643).\n\n[366:2](sbe2656.htm#fr_856) In the St. Petersburg Dictionary 'patnivata _h_ '\nseems to be taken as qualifying 'grahan;' but cp. Rig-veda VIII, 82, 22,\n'United with their wives (i.e. the water mixed with the Soma-juice?) these\nSoma-draughts (suta _h_ ) go longing to the rejoicing.'\n\n[367:1](sbe2656.htm#fr_857) 'i _s_ ,' etymologically connected with 'own.'\n\n[367:2](sbe2656.htm#fr_858) Or, wived, mated one, 'patnivan;' the Ka _n_ va\ntext reads 'Agne Va _k_ patni.' See preceding page, note 2.\n\n[368:1](sbe2656.htm#fr_859) But if it be an Ukthya, or Shoda _s_ in, or\nAtiratra, or Va _g_ apeya, Ka _n_ va text. See towards the end of next note.\n\n[368:2](sbe2656.htm#fr_860) Katy. X, 7 and schol. supply the following\ndetails. The Unnet _ri_ puts down the _k_ amasa cups behind the high altar,\nand pours into them the entire Soma-juice remaining in the Putabh _ri_ t,\nputting but little into the Hot _ri_ 's cup, to leave room in it for the\ndhruva libation. Besides this the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a is the only Soma that remains.\nThe Adhvaryu then, by touching the Soma in the Hot _ri_ 's cup with two stalks\nof grass, gives the signal for the chanting of the Agnish _t_ oma Saman (viz.\nthe Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya, Samav. II, 53, 54), wrapping up his head, if\nhe chooses, in the same way as the Udgat _ri_ s. Meanwhile the Nesh _t_ _ri_\nleads up the lady through the back door into the Sadas, makes her sit down\nnorth of the Udgat _ri_ and exchange looks with the latter three times (at the\n'Hi _m_ ,' see [p. 308](sbe2649.htm#page_308), note [2](sbe2649.htm#fn_745)).\nThree times also (at every Nidhana) she uncovers her right leg and pours on it\nsome of the panne _g_ ani water fetched by her in the morning (see [III, 9, 3,\n27](sbe2638.htm#3:9:3:27)), p. 369 whereupon she returns to her own tent. Then\nfollows the recitation of the \xc3\x82gnimaruta _s_ astra, consisting of the\nfollowing parts:--\n\nSukta (hymn), Rig-veda III, 3, to Agni Vai _s_ vanara, with Nivid ('May Agni\nVai _s_ vanara feast on this Soma,' &c.) inserted before the last verse.\n\nDhayya, I, 43, 6; or (verse to Rudra) II, 33, 1.\n\nSukta, I, 87, to Maruts, with Nivid ('May the Maruts feast on this Soma,' &c.)\nbefore the last verse.\n\nStotriya pragatha, VI, 48, 1-2 (identical with the text of the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya Saman).  \nAnurupa pragatha, VII, 16, II-12 (antistrophe).\n\nSukta to Agni _G_ atavedas, I, 143, with Nivid before the last verse.\n\nTristich to \xc3\x82pa _h_ (waters), X, 9, 1-3, recited in breaks, the Hot _ri_\nhaving previously uncovered his head (as do the other priests) and touched\nwater, and the others holding on to him from behind. This and the following\nparts also have the \xc3\x82hava (' _s_ o _m_ savom') before each of them.\n\nVerse VI, 50, 14 to Agni Budhnya.\n\nVerses V, 46, 7-8 to wives of gods.\n\nVerses II, 32, 4-5 to Raka.\n\nVerse VI, 49, 7 to Paviravi (daughter of lightning).\n\nVerse X, 14, 4 to Yama.\n\nVerse X, 14, 3 to Kavyas (manes).\n\nVerses X, 15, 1, 3, 2 to Pitara _h_ (fathers), with the \xc3\x82hava before each\nverse.\n\nAnupaniya (or Svadushkiliya) verses VI, 47, I-4 to Indra. After each of the\nfirst three the Adhvaryu may respond to the Hot _ri_ 's \xc3\x82hava, with 'madamo\ndaiva' (instead of ' _s_ a _m_ samo daiva'). See note on [IV, 3, 2,\n11](sbe2651.htm#4:3:2:11).\n\nVerse to Vish _n_ u and Varu _n_ a (Atharva-veda VII, 25, 1). p. 370\n\nVerse to Vish _n_ u, Rig-veda I, 154, 1.\n\nVerse to Pra _g_ apati, X, 53, 6.\n\nParidhaniya (concluding verse) IV, 17, 20, in reciting which the Hot _ri_\ntouches the ground; and during the recitation of the last pada the Dhruva\ngraha is poured into the Hot _ri_ 's cup.\n\nUkthavirya, 'Praise has been sung to Indra, to the gods, for hearing (?)\nthee!'\n\nYa _g_ ya (offering prayer) V, 60, 8, at the conclusion of which libations are\nmade to Agni and the Maruts, both at the Vasha _t_ and Anuvasha _t_.\n\nThen follow the after-offerings of the animal sacrifice (see [III, 8, 4,\n1](sbe2634.htm#3:8:4:1) seq.).\n\nAt the Ukthya (and other Soma-sacrifices) the Ukthya graha is drawn\nimmediately after the drawing of the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a (see [IV, 3, 5,\n24](sbe2654.htm#4:3:5:24), with note). Previous to the after-offerings the\nUkthya graha is divided, as at the morning and midday performances (see [p.\n293](sbe2647.htm#page_293), note [2](sbe2647.htm#fn_706)), between the three\nHotrakas, with a view to the recitation of their _s_ astras which form the\ndistinctive feature of the Ukthya sacrifice, bringing up the number of _s_\nastras (and stotras) from twelve (of the Agnish _t_ oma) to fifteen. Besides,\nthe Ukthya requires the immolation of at least two victims on the Soma-day,\nviz. a he-goat to Indra and Agni, besides the one to Agni.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 3.
