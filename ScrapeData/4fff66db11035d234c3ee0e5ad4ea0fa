Those fires have been kindled (afresh); and they (the priests and\nsacrificer) betake themselves to the lump of clay 1;--those fires doubtless\nare these worlds: when they are kindled, then they are these worlds. For\nformerly the gods were seeking this sacred rite outside of these worlds; and\nwhen he fetches the lump of clay after passing by those fires, he is seeking\nhim (Agni) outside of these worlds.\n\n6:3:3:22\\. They go eastwards; for the east is Agni's region: he thus seeks him\nin his own region, finds him in his own region.\n\n6:3:3:33\\. They go forward, with, 'A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, we go to Agni Purishya;'--\nthat is, 'like Agni, we are going to Agni, favourable to cattle.'\n\n6:3:3:44\\. He then looks at the sham-man, with, 'A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, we shall carry\nAgni Purishya;'--that is, 'Like Agni, we shall carry Agni, favourable to\ncattle:' he thus searches for him by means of the sham-man.\n\n6:3:3:55\\. Thereupon a hollow ant-hill is laid down midways (between the lump\nof clay and the \xc3\x82havaniya fire). He looks along it 2; for the ant-hill is this\n\np. 207\n\nearth, and this earth is these worlds. For the gods searched for him (Agni) in\nthese worlds part by part; and in like manner does this one now search for him\nin these worlds part by part.\n\n6:3:3:66\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 17] 'Agni hath looked along the crest of the\nDawns,'--thereby they sought him in the dawns;--'along the days, he, the first\nknower of beings,'--thereby they sought him in the days;--'and oftentimes\nalong the rays of the sun,'--thereby they sought him in the rays of the\nsun;--'along the sky and the earth hast thou spread;'--therewith they sought\nhim in the sky and the earth, and found him; and in like manner does this one\nthereby find him (Agni). When he sees him from afar, he throws down that (ant-\nhill); and they go up to the lump of clay.\n\n6:3:3:77\\. He then addresses the horse; for the gods then said, 'Let us drive\naway his evil!' Now evil is weariness: thus, 'Let us drive away his weariness,\nthe evil!' They drove away his weariness, the evil; and in like manner does\nthis one now drive away his weariness, the evil.\n\n6:3:3:88\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 18] 'The courser, having started on his way,'--for\nhis way has indeed been started upon;--'shaketh off all assaults,'--assaults\nmean evils: thus, 'shakes off all evils;' and hence, indeed, the horse, whilst\nrunning, shakes itself;--'Agni he seeks to descry with his eye on the great\nseat;'--the great seat doubtless is this sacrificial (place): thus, 'Agni he\nwishes to see with his eye on this great seat.'\n\n6:3:3:99\\. He then makes it (the horse) step on (the lump of clay with the\nleft fore-foot); for having discovered him (Agni), it (the horse) then\nindicated\n\np. 208\n\nhim to the gods, as if (it meant to say) 1, 'Just here he is!'\n\n6:3:3:1010\\. And, again, why he makes it step thereon;--the gods then were\nafraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not slay here this\nour (Agni)!' They placed that thunderbolt upon him as a protector, to wit,\nyonder sun; for that horse is indeed yonder sun; and in like manner does this\n(Sacrificer, or priest) now place upon him that thunderbolt as a protector.\n\n6:3:3:1111\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 19] 'Having come upon the earth, O courser, seek\nthou Agni by thy light!'--the light is the eye: thus, 'Having come to the\nearth, thou, O courser, seek Agni with thy eye!'--'by pawing 2 the ground tell\nus where we may dig him out!'--that is, 'by pointing out that (spot) of the\nground tell us where we may dig him out.'\n\n6:3:3:1212\\. He then pulls it up 3; for the gods now endowed it with vigour\n(for) having indicated (Agni) to them; and in like manner does this one now\nendow it with vigour (for) having indicated (Agni) to him. He does so, with\n[Va _g_. S. XI, 20], 'The sky is thy back, the earth thy resting-place, the\nair thy body, the sea thy womb;'--whereby he says, 'Such\n\np. 209\n\nthou art, such thou art;'--'Looking about with thine eye, tread down the\nassailers!'--that is, 'Looking about with thy eye, tread down all evildoers!'\nHe does not touch it, lest this thunderbolt should injure him, for the horse\nis a thunderbolt 1.\n\n6:3:3:1313\\. He then makes it step off (the lump of clay);--for the gods now\nsaid, 'What shall we cause it to obtain 2?'--'Great beauty 3!'--They caused it\nto obtain great beauty; and in like manner does this one now cause it to\nobtain great beauty,--with (Va _g_. S. XI, 21), 'Go thou unto great beauty!'--\nthat is, 'Go to thy great beauty!' and therefore, indeed, the horse is the\nmost highly-favoured of animals;--'from this standing-place,'--that is, 'where\nthou now standest;'--'wealth-giver!'--for wealth it does give\nthem;--'Courser!'--for this is a courser;--'May we be in the Earth's favour,\nwhilst Agni we dig in her lap!'--that is, 'May we be in the favour of this\nearth, whilst digging (for) Agni in her lap!'\n\n6:3:3:1414\\. When it has stepped off he addresses it;--for as one would extol\nhim who has given a gift, so the gods now praised and magnified it (for)\nhaving indicated (Agni); and in like manner does this one now praise and\nmagnify it, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 22), 'He hath come down,'--for it has indeed\ncome down,--'the wealth-giver,'--for wealth, indeed, is given them; 'the\nracing courser,'--for it is indeed a racer and a courser;--'hath made good,\nwell-made room on earth,'--that is, 'thou madest good, well-made room on\nearth;'--'thence let us\n\np. 210\n\ndig out the fair-looking Agni,'--'fair-looking,' he says, for Agni is indeed\nfair-looking on every side;--'ascending the heaven, unto the highest sky,'--\nthe sky is the heavenly world: thus, 'mounting the heavenly world, unto the\nhighest sky.' He makes it come up on the right side (of the lump) to where the\ntwo other beasts are: they stand on the right side, facing the east. The\nsignificance of the right-hand (southern) position here is the same as it was\non that former occasion.\n\n6:3:3:1515\\. Sitting down he now offers upon the lump of clay;--for the gods\nthen said, 'Meditate ye ( _k_ etay),' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say,\n'Seek ye a layer ( _k_ iti)!' Whilst meditating they saw this libation, and\noffered it: after offering it, they saw the fire-pan (representing) these\nworlds.\n\n6:3:3:1616\\. They said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say,\n'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst meditating they saw this second libation, and\noffered it: after offering it, they saw the Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis (all-light\nbricks), that is, those deities Agni, Vayu, and \xc3\x82ditya; for these deities are\nindeed all the light. And in like manner does the Sacrificer now, after\noffering those two libations, see the fire-pan, these worlds; and those all-\nlight deities. He offers with two interlinked (verses) 1: he thereby\ninterlinks these worlds, and those deities.\n\n6:3:3:1717\\. And, again, why he offers these two libations;--he thereby\ngratifies both the clay and the water; and having offered to, and gratified,\nthese two, he then brings them together. With two interlinked\n\np. 211\n\n[paragraph continues] (verses) he offers: he thereby interlinks (combines\nthoroughly) the clay and the water.\n\n6:3:3:1818\\. He offers with ghee; for the ghee is a thunderbolt: he thus makes\nthe thunderbolt its (or his, Agni's) protector. The ghee, moreover, is seed:\nhe thus pours forth seed,--with the sruva-spoon; for the sruva (m.) is a male,\nand the male pours forth seed,--with 'Svaha (hail!),' for the Svahakara (m.)\nis a male, and the male pours forth seed.\n\n6:3:3:1919\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 23 1] 'Upon thee I sprinkle with thought, with\nghee,'--that is, 'upon thee I offer with thought and ghee;'--'that dwellest\nnear all beings,'--for he (Agni) indeed comes to dwell near every\nbeing;--'thee, large and great with side-spent force,'--for large he is, and\ndirected sideways, and great with force, with smoke;--'most ample through\nfood, and fierce to look at,'--that is, 'capacious with food, a consumer of\nfood, and flaming.'\n\n6:3:3:2020\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 24] 'From all sides I sprinkle the hitherward\nlooking,'--that is, 'from every side I offer upon the hitherward\nlooking;'--'with spiteless mind let him relish this,'--that is, 'with\nunchafing mind may he relish this;'--'Agni, glorious as a wooer, and of\npleasing colour,'--for Agni is indeed glorious as a wooer 2 and of pleasing\ncolour;--'not to be touched, while raging with his body,'--for not to be\ntouched is he, whilst flaming with his body.\n\n6:3:3:2121\\. With two (verses) he offers; for the Sacrificer\n\np. 212\n\nis two-footed, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed;--with two (verses)\nrelating to Agni: it is Agni he thereby pours forth as seed. Inasmuch as they\nrelate to Agni, they are Agni; and inasmuch as they are Trish _t_ ubhs, they\nare Indra; and Agni (the fire) belongs to Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is,\nas great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed.\nMoreover, Indra and Agni are all the gods, and Agni (thus) contains all\ndeities: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus\npours him forth as seed.\n\n6:3:3:2222\\. He offers on the horse's footprint;--the horse is the same as\nthat Agni, and so, indeed, these two libations come to be offered over Agni.\n\n6:3:3:2323\\. He draws lines around it (the lump, with the spade): he thereby\nputs a measure to it (or, to him, Agni), as if saying, 'So great thou art!'\n\n6:3:3:2424\\. And, again, why he draws a line around it;--the gods now were\nafraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite here this\n(Agni) of ours!' They drew that rampart round it; and in like manner does this\none now draw that rampart round it,--with the spade, for the spade is the\nthunderbolt, and he thus makes the thunderbolt its (or his, Agni's) protector.\nHe draws it all round: on every side he thus makes that thunderbolt to be its\n(or his) protector 1. Three times he draws a line: that threefold thunderbolt\nhe thus makes to be a protector for him.\n\n6:3:3:2525\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 25-27] 'Around the wise lord\n\np. 213\n\nof strength-- 1,' 'Around (us) we (place) thee, O Agni, as a rampart-- 2,'\n'With the days, thou Agni-- 3,' in thus praising Agni he makes a fence for him\nby means of (verses) containing the word 'pari' (around), for all round, as it\nwere, (run) the ramparts;--(he does so by verses) relating to Agni: a\nstronghold of fire he thus makes for him, and this stronghold of fire keeps\nblazing;--(he does so) by three (verses): a threefold stronghold he thus makes\nfor him; and hence that threefold stronghold is the highest form of\nstrongholds. Each following (circular) line he makes wider, and with a larger\nmetre: hence each following line of strongholds is wider, for strongholds\n(ramparts) are lines.\n\n6:3:3:2626\\. He then digs for him (Agni) 4 in this earth. For the gods then\nwere afraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite him\nhere 1! For the sake of protection they made this earth to be a self (body,\natman) for him, thinking, 'His own self will protect his own self.' It (the\nlump of clay) should be as large as the hole: thus this earth (or clay)\nbecomes his (Agni's) self. And as to its (being) as large as the hole,--this\nearth is the womb, and this (clay) is teed; and whatever part of the seed\n\np. 214\n\nexceeds the womb, becomes useless; and what is deficient, is unsuccessful; but\nthat part of the seed which is within the hole is successful. Four-cornered is\nthis hole, for there are four quarters: from all the (four) quarters he thus\ndigs him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[206:1](sbe4136.htm#fr_420) The lump of clay which is to be used for the\nmaking of the fire-pan has been placed in a square hole east of the \xc3\x82havaniya\nfire.\n\n[206:2](sbe4136.htm#fr_421) That is to say, he looks at the lump of clay\nthrough the hollow part of the ant-hill, whilst muttering the formula given in\nthe next paragraph.\n\n[208:1](sbe4136.htm#fr_422) Or, as if one were to say,--yathayam iha-sthana\nastha(?) iti ka _s_ _k_ id bruyad eva _m_ proktavan, Say.\n\n[208:2](sbe4136.htm#fr_423) Or, by covering;--it is not easy to see what the\nauthor makes of 'v _ri_ ttvaya,' for which the St. Petersburg dictionary\nsuggests 'v _ri_ tvaya.' Mahidhara derives it from 'vart,' in the sense of 'to\ntouch.' Perhaps, however, 'bhumer' depends on 'yatas;' hence 'moving about,\ntell us from what spot of the ground we may dig him out.'\n\n[208:3](sbe4136.htm#fr_424) That is, he pulls up its head (?); 'he rouses it,\nshakes it up,' St. Petersb.

II, 50, 4, beginning, however, 'I\nsprinkle Agni with a ghee-oblation.'\n\n[211:2](sbe4136.htm#fr_430) Mahidhara and Saya _n_ a ( _Ri_ k S.
