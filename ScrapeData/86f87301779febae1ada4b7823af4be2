On account of light being seen (declared in the text).\n\nBetween the two texts referring to the Person of the size of a thumb, there is\na text declaring that to that Person there belongs light that obscures all\nother light, and is the cause and assistance of all other light; and such\nlight is characteristic of Brahman only. 'The sun does not shine there, nor\nthe moon and the stars, nor these lightnings, and much less this fire. After\nhim, the shining one, everything shines; by his light all this is lighted'\n(Ka. Up. II, 5, 15)--This very same _s_ loka is read in the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a\n(i.e.\n\np. 349\n\n[paragraph continues] Mu _n_ daka) with reference to Brahman. Everywhere, in\nfact, the texts attribute supreme luminousness to Brahman only. Compare:\n'Having approached the highest light he manifests himself in his own shape' (\n_Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 3); 'Him the gods meditate on as the light of lights, as\nimmortal time' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4,16); 'Now that light which shines above this\nheaven' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 13, 7).--It is thus a settled conclusion that the\nPerson measured by a thumb is the highest Brahman.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'him who is measured' (by a thumb).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 42.
