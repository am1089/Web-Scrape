Charm against dropsy.\n\n1\\. Thy golden chamber, king Varuna, is built in the waters! Thence the king\nthat maintains the laws shall loosen all shackles!  \n2\\. From every habitation (of thine), O king Varuna, from here do thou free\nus! In that we have said, 'ye waters, ye cows;' in that we have said, 'O\nVaruna,' from this (sin), O Varuna, free us!  \n3\\. Lift from us, O Varuna, the uppermost fetter, take down the nethermost,\nloosen the middlemost! Then shall we, O \xc3\x82ditya, in thy law, exempt from guilt,\nlive in freedom!  \n4\\. Loosen from us, O Varuna, all fetters, the uppermost, the nethermost, and\nthose imposed by Varuna! Evil dreams, and misfortune drive away from us: then\nmay we go to the world of the pious!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 24.
