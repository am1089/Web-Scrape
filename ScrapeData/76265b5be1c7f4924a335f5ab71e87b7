The objection (raised above) is not valid, since (the connexion of the\nsoul with the buddhi) exists as long as the soul; it being thus observed (in\nscripture).\n\nWe need not fear that the objection formulated above can be proved.--Why?--'On\naccount of the existence of the connexion of the soul with the buddhi, as long\nas the\n\np. 46\n\nsoul exists.' That means: as long as this Self is in the sa _m_ sara-state, as\nlong as the sa _m_ sara-state is not brought to an end by means of perfect\nknowledge, so long the connexion of the soul with the buddhi does not cease.\nAnd as long as its connexion with the buddhi, its limiting adjunct, lasts, so\nlong the individual soul remains individual soul, implicated in transmigratory\nexistence. In reality, however, there is no individual soul but in so far as\nit is fictitiously hypostatized by the buddhi, its limiting adjunct. For in\nattempting to determine the object of the Vedanta-texts we meet with no other\nintelligent substance but the one omniscient Lord whose nature is eternal\nfreedom. This appears from innumerable texts, such as the following:--'There\nis no other seer but he, there is no other hearer but he, there is no other\nperceiver but he, there is no other knower but he' (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 23);\n'There is nothing that sees, hears, perceives, knows but it' (B _ri_. Up. III,\n8, 11); 'Thou art that' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 7); 'I am Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. I,\n4, 10).--How again is it known that the soul is connected with the buddhi as\nlong as it exists?--We reply: because that is seen (viz. in scripture). For\nscripture makes the following declaration: 'He who is within the heart,\nconsisting of knowledge, surrounded by the pra _n_ as, the person of light, he\nremaining the same wanders along the two worlds as if thinking, as if moving'\n(B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 7). Here the term 'consisting of knowledge' means\n'consisting of buddhi,' as we infer from another passage, viz. 'The Self\nconsisting of knowledge, mind, life, sight, hearing' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 5),\nwhere knowledge is enumerated among mind and, so on 1. By 'being made up of\nbuddhi' is meant 'having for one's essence the qualities of buddhi.' Similarly\na phrase like 'Devadatta is made up of womanishness,' which may be made use of\nin ordinary language, means that in Devadatta feminine attributes such as\nsoftness of voice and the like prevail. Moreover, the passage, 'He remaining\nthe same wanders along the two worlds,' declares that the Self, even\n\np. 47\n\nwhen going to another world, is not separated from the buddhi, &c. For if we\nask whereby it does remain the same, the answer, based on proximity 1, is 'by\nmeans of the buddhi.'--Further, such modes of expression, 'as if thinking,'\n'as if moving,' lead us to the same conclusion; for they mean that the Self\ndoes not think and move on its own account, but thinks as it were and moves as\nit were, because the buddhi to which it is joined really moves and thinks.--\nMoreover, the connexion of the Self with the buddhi, its limiting adjunct,\ndepends on wrong knowledge, and wrong knowledge cannot cease except through\nperfect knowledge; hence as long as there does not rise the cognition of\nBrahman being the universal Self, so long the connexion of the soul with the\nbuddhi and its other limiting adjuncts does not come to an end. Thus scripture\nalso says, 'I know that great person of sunlike lustre beyond the darkness. A\nman who knows him passes over death; there is no other path to go' ( _S_ ve.\nUp. III, 8).\n\nBut, an objection is raised, in the states of deep sleep and retractation\n(pralaya) no connexion of the Self with the buddhi can be acknowledged, since\nscripture declares that 'then he becomes united with the True, he is gone to\nhis own' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 1), and as then all modifications have avowedly\npassed away. How then can it be said that the connexion with the buddhi exists\nas long as the Self?--To this objection the following Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[46:1](sbe38031.htm#fr_30) And therefore has to be understood in the sense of\nbuddhi.\n\n[47:1](sbe38031.htm#fr_31) I.e. on the proximity of terms clearly indicating\nthe buddhi, viz. vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana-maya _h_ pra _n_ eshu.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 31](sbe38032.htm)\n\n"
