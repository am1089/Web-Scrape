Having now returned (to the hall), he, at the proper time, throws\nup the Dhish _n_ yas 1 (fire-hearths)--these hearths are fires: he thus builds\nup fire-altars. They are the clansmen, and the built-up fire-altar is the\nchieftaincy: he thus sets up both the chieftaincy and the clan. The former\n(altar) he builds up first, then these (hearths): thus he sets up the clan\nafter setting up the chieftaincy.\n\n9:4:3:22\\. That (fire-altar) is a single one: he thus makes the chieftaincy to\nattach to a single (person), and (social) distinction to attach to a single\n(person). The others are numerous: he thus bestows multiplicity on the clan.\n\np. 242\n\n9:4:3:33\\. That (fire-altar) consists of five layers, the others of a single\nlayer: he thus endows the chieftain (or, ruler) pre-eminently with power, and\nmakes the chieftain more powerful than the clan (or people). Upwards he builds\nthat one: he thus builds the ruling power upward by (social) layers; sideways\nthe others: he thus makes the clan obedient to the chieftain from below.\n\n9:4:3:44\\. That one he builds up both with the Ya _g_ ushmati (bricks laid\ndown with a special formula), and with the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a (or space-filling\nones, laid down with a common formula); the others with the space-filling one\nalone: he thus endows the chieftain pre-eminently with power, and makes the\nchieftain more powerful than the clan, and the clan less powerful than the\nchieftain.\n\n9:4:3:55\\. And when he builds up these (hearths) only with the space-filling\none, the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a being the nobility 1\\--he thereby places the\nchieftain, as the eater, among the clan. He builds up (dhish _n_ ya-hearths)\nboth of the Soma-sacrifice 2, and of the fire-altar; first those of the Soma-\nsacrifice, and then those of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been\nexplained. Whatever Soma-hearth he (merely) throws up (at the Soma-sacrifice),\nthat he (now) builds up. The \xc3\x82gnidhriya he builds first, for that\n\np. 243\n\none he throws up first (at the Soma-sacrifice); (he does so) whilst sitting to\nthe right (south) of it: the significance of this has been explained 1.\n\n9:4:3:66\\. On this (\xc3\x82gnidhriya) he puts eight bricks,--the Gayatri consists of\neight syllables, and Agni is of Gayatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great\nas is his measure, so great he thus builds him up. The variegated stone 2 is\nthe ninth of them: there are nine vital airs--seven in the head and two\ndownward ones--it is these he thus puts into it. The fire which is placed on\nthe erected (hearth) is the tenth;--there are ten vital airs 3, and the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra is the middle (between the Garhapatya and \xc3\x82havaniya fires).: he thus\nputs the vital airs in the middle of it; for the vital airs, being in the\nmiddle of the body, move along it in this direction, and in that direction.\n\n9:4:3:77\\. Twenty-one he places on the Hotriya (hearth), and there are twenty-\none enclosing-stones 4: the significance of this has been explained.\n\n9:4:3:88\\. Six (he places) on the Mar _g_ aliya,--these are the six seasons,\nthe Fathers; for the seasons, the\n\np. 244\n\n[paragraph continues] Fathers 1, indeed, heaped up (a rampart) round that\n(fire) from the south. This one lies to the south of those (other hearths) 2,\n--this (\xc3\x82gnidhriya) he lays down in this way (direction), and these (other\nhearths) in this way, and that one (the Fire-altar) in this way: he thereby\nmakes the peasantry look towards the chieftain.\n\n9:4:3:99\\. He then encloses these (hearths) by enclosing-stones;--the\nenclosing-stones are the waters: it is thus by water that he surrounds them 3.\nHe merely lays them down all round, for those of the waters which flow in a\nhollow (channel) are the chieftain, and these stray waters are the clansmen;\nthus, when he encloses that (great fire-altar) by a dug-in (row of stones), he\nthereby adds power to power, and sure rounds (protects) power by power; and\nwhen he merely lays down those (enclosing-stones of the hearths) all round, he\nthereby adds clansman (or clan) to clansman, and surrounds (protects) clansman\nby clansman 4. As many bricks with special formulas as\n\np. 245\n\nthere are (in each hearth) so many enclosing-stones there are (in each); for\nwith that (fire-altar) there are as many enclosing-stones as there are such\nbricks in it 1: he thus makes the clan obedient and subservient to the chief.\n\n9:4:3:1010\\. He then scatters a layer of earth on (each of) these (hearths):\nthe significance of this has been explained 2. Silently 3 (he scatters it),\nfor indistinct is the clan (or people). Then, after the cake-offering of the\nAgnishomiya (animal sacrifice) 4, he prepares the propitiatory oblations to\nthe Regions;--that fire-altar is the regions: it is to them he offers these\noblations, and thus by offering makes them a deity, for only that one is a\ndeity to whom an oblation is offered, but not that to whom if is. not offered.\nThere are five (such oblations), for there are five regions.\n\n9:4:3:1111\\. As to this they say,--Let him prepare this\n\np. 246\n\noffering (ish _t_ i) so as to consist of material for ten oblations;--this\n(offering) is (performed) with all the stomas and all the p _ri_ sh _th_ a\n(samans) 1; and there are (used in it) all the metres, all the regions, all\nthe seasons--and this Agni (the fire-altar) is all this: he thus, by the\n(amount of) offering material (taken out for the ish _t_ i), makes (Agni) the\ndeity 2; for only that one is the deity for whom the oblation is prepared, not\none for whom it is not prepared. There are (in that case) ten (oblations),--\nthe Vira _g_ (metre) consists of ten syllables, and Agni is vira _g_ (far-\nshining, or far-ruling); there are ten regions, and Agni (the fire-altar) is\nthe regions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is,\nas great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.\n\n9:4:3:1212\\. But, indeed, he may also take out these oblations for the Divine\nQuickeners 3; for these are the deities which become consecrated by this\nconsecration ceremony by which he is now to be consecrated: it is them he thus\ngratifies, and gratified by offering they permit him (to perform) this\nconsecration ceremony, and with their permission he is\n\np. 247\n\nconsecrated; for only he becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume)\nthe royal dignity, but not he whom they do not (allow to assume it). And\ninasmuch as these deities are consecrated (quickened) by this consecration\nceremony and quicken him for this consecration, they are (called) the Divine\nQuickeners.\n\n9:4:3:1313\\. These (deities) come to have two. names, as he who is consecrated\nby the rite of consecration comes to have two names; for the very rite of\nconsecration for which he is quickened, and by which he is consecrated\n(quickened), is his second name 1.\n\n9:4:3:1414\\. There are eight (such deities),--the Gayatri consists of eight\nsyllables, and Agni is of Gayatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.\n\n9:4:3:1515\\. As to this they say,--He ought not to offer (any of) these\noblations, lest he should do what is excessive. Let him nevertheless offer\nthem; for these oblations are offered for (the obtainment of special) wishes,\nand in wishes there is nothing excessive. And whatsoever oblation he offers\nafter the Pa _s_ upuro _d_ a _s_ a (the cake-offering connected with the\nanimal sacrifice), that is placed inside the animal victim itself as its\nsacrificial sap 2. He offers both kinds (of oblations), those of the Soma-\nsacrifice and those of the fire-altar (or Agni _k_ ayana), first those of the\n\np. 248\n\n[paragraph continues] Soma-sacrifice, and afterwards those of the fire-altar\nthe purport of this has been explained. In a loud voice 1 the Pa _s_ upuro _d_\na _s_ a offering (is performed), in a low voice these (additional oblations),\nfor they are an ish _t_ i 2. With the Pa _s_ upuro _d_ a _s_ a he (the\nAdhvaryu) says, 'Recite!--Urge!' and with these (oblations), 'Recite!--Worship\n3' for they are an ish _t_ i. There is the same Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t and the\nsame i _d_ a 4 (for these oblations). The (Devasu) deities have received\noffering, and the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (of the Pa _s_ upuro _d_ a _s_ a) has\nnot yet been attended to 5,--\n\np. 249\n\n9:4:3:1616\\. He then touches it (the fire-altar) with (the formula of) the\npreliminary consecration (Va _g_. S. IX, 39. 40), 'May Savit _ri_ quicken thee\nfor (powers of) quickening [1](sbe4342.htm#fn_431)! . . . This (man), O ye\n(people), is your king; Soma is the king of us Brahma _n_ as!'--he thereby\nexcludes the Brahma _n_ as (from the power of the king) and makes them such as\nare not to be fed upon (by the king).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[241:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_413) A Soma-sacrifice being about to be performed on\nthe newly erected fire-altar, now properly consecrated, all the necessary\npreparatory business and ceremonial enjoined for such a sacrifice have now to\nbe gone through in the way detailed in part ii of this translation. The author\nhere only alludes to those points in the Soma-ritual in regard to which the\npresent performance offers any special feature either additional to, or\nmodificatory of, the ordinary ceremonial. The construction of the Dhish _n_\nyas, or fire-hearths of the different priests (for which see part ii, p. 148,\nnote 4), is one of these points.\n\n[242:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_414) See [p. 132](sbe4327.htm#page_132), note\n[2](sbe4327.htm#fn_235).\n\n[242:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_415) There are eight dhish _n_ ya-hearths at the Soma-\nsacrifice, two of which, the \xc3\x82gnidhriya and Mar _g_ aliya, were raised north\nand south of the cart-shed (havirdhana), whilst the others (viz. those of the\nHot _ri_ , &c.) were raised inside the Sadas along its eastern side. They were\nmerely mounds of earth covered with sand, whilst the additional hearths (of\nthe fire-altar) now to be erected are partly built of bricks.\n\n[243:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_416) See VII, 1, 1, 21 seq., where the way in which the\nbricks of the Garhapatya hearth are laid down is described in detail.\n\n[243:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_417) When Agni was led forwards from the Garhapatya to\nbe installed on his newly built altar, as the \xc3\x82havaniya or offering fire, a\nvariegated stone, meant to represent the sun, was deposited near the place (on\nthe northern edge of the Vedi) where the \xc3\x82gnidhra shed and hearth would\nafterwards have to be erected; see [IX, 2, 3,\n14](sbe4334.htm#9:2:3:14)-[19](sbe4334.htm#9:2:3:19).\n\n[243:3](sbe4341.htm#fr_418) That is, including the central one, the outlet of\nwhich is the navel; cf. [VIII, 1, 3, 10](sbe4305.htm#8:1:3:10).\n\n[243:4](sbe4341.htm#fr_419) The numbers of bricks and enclosing-stones are the\nsame as for the Garhapatya hearth, for which (with their symbolic meaning) see\nVII, I, I, 32-35.\n\n[244:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_420) Saya _n_ a refers to a passage in the\nTaittiriyaka, according to which a dying man is changed to whatever season he\ndies in, whence the six seasons are the representatives of all the deceased\nancestors. Since the Fathers reside in the southern region it is from that\nquarter that, by laying down the bricks, they are supposed to raise a rampart\nfor the Mar _g_ aliya fire.\n\n[244:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_421) Viz. on the southern edge of the Vedi, exactly\nsouth of the \xc3\x82gnidhriya, whilst the other dhish _n_ yas run in a line from\nnorth to south to the left of the space between the \xc3\x82gnidhriya and Mar _g_\naliya. The other hearths, together with the great fire-altar occupying the\neastern part of the Vedi, would thus, as it were, face the Mar _g_ aliya in a\nsemicircle. See the plan of the Sacrificial ground, part ii, p. 475.\n\n[244:3](sbe4341.htm#fr_422) That is, as the earth is surrounded by the ocean\n(VII, 1, 1, 13), or a stronghold by a moat.\n\n[244:4](sbe4341.htm#fr_423) Viz. inasmuch as the fire-altar and the \xc3\x82havaniya\nfire on it, as p. 245 well as the dug-in circle of enclosing-stones, are\nidentified with the ruling power; whilst the dhish _n_ yas as well as the\ncircles of stones lying loosely around them represent the clan.\n\n[245:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_424) This is not clear to me: whilst there are 395 such\nbricks with special formulas in the five layers of the great altar, it is\nenclosed by only 261 pari _s_ rits; see [p. 158](sbe4330.htm#page_158), note\n[1](sbe4330.htm#fn_264). Besides there are no 'ya _g_ ushmati' bricks in these\nhearths, but only 'lokamp _ri_ _n_ as'; one would therefore expect 'ish _t_\nakas' (bricks) for 'ya _g_ ushmatyas' the first time (cf. comm. on Katy. _S_\nr. XVIII, 7, 13). The Hot _ri_ 's hearth contains twenty-one bricks, the\nBrahma _n_ a _k_ _kh_ a _m_ sin's eleven, the Mar _g_ aliya six, and the\nothers eight bricks; and in each case the common formula, 'Lokam p _ri_ _n_ a,\n&c,' (see [VIII, 7, 2, 6](sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:6)), is pronounced once after\nevery ten bricks, and after any odd bricks remaining over at the end. Cf.\nKaty. _S_ r. XVIII, 6, 8 seq.\n\n[245:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_425) See [VIII, 7, 3, 1](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:1) seq.\n\n[245:3](sbe4341.htm#fr_426) He does not use any such formula as that used in\ncovering each layer of the great altar with earth; see [VIII, 7, 3,\n7](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:7).\n\n[245:4](sbe4341.htm#fr_427) See part ii, p. 199, note 2 (where the reference\nat the end should be to IV, 2, 5, 22).\n\n[246:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_428) See part iii, introduction, p. xx seq.\n\n[246:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_429) As Saya _n_ a points out, the Taittiriyas make\nAgni the deity of this ish _t_ i, the invitatory formulas (puro\xe0\xa4\xbdnuvakya) of\nthe different havis (oblations) naming him each time with different epithets\nrelating to different metres, stomas, p _ri_ sh _th_ as, and seasons. Cf.\nTaitt. S. I, 8, 4: Taitt. Br. I, 8, 19.\n\n[246:3](sbe4341.htm#fr_430) For these eight deities (Savit _ri_ Satyaprasava,\nAgni G _ri_ hapati, &c.), to whom offering is made at the Abhishe _k_ aniya or\nConsecration ceremony of the Ra _g_ asuya, between the chief oblation of the\nanimal cake-offering (Pa _s_ upuro _d_ a _s_ a) and its Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t,\nwhilst the whole of the Pa _s_ upuro _d_ a _s_ a is again performed in the\nmiddle of the animal sacrifice, see part iii, p. 69 seq.\n\n[247:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_431) That is to say, for example, he who has performed\nthe Va _g_ apeya is called Va _g_ apeya-ya _g_ in, Say.\n\n[247:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_432) These oblations, as well as those of the Pa _s_\nupuro _d_ a _s_ a, inserted as they are in the middle of the animal offering,\n--just after the offering of the omentum of the victim,--are supposed to\nsupply to the victim its sacrificial sap or essence which was taken out of it\nin the shape of the omentum. See III, 8, 3, 2.\n\n[248:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_433) That is, in the formulas the name of the deity to\nwhom the oblation is offered is pronounced in a loud voice.\n\n[248:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_434) That is, a 'kamyesh _t_ i,' or offering for the\nobtainment of some special object, which has to be performed in a low voice;\nsee I, 3, 5, 10.\n\n[248:3](sbe4341.htm#fr_435) Or, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer!' For these two\nlatter calls (anubruhi!--ya _g_ a!), by which the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot\n_ri_ to pronounce the invitatory prayer (anuvakya or puro\xe0\xa4\xbdnuvakya) and the\noffering-prayer (ya _g_ ya) respectively, at ish _t_ is, see I, 5, 2, 8-10 and\nI, 5, 3, 8; and for the first two (anubruhi!--preshya!), by the former of\nwhich the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot _ri_ to recite the invitatory prayer;\nwhilst by the latter he calls on the Maitravaru _n_ a to 'urge' (or prompt')\nthe Hot _ri_ to pronounce the offering-prayer at the animal sacrifice, see\nIII, 8, 1, 4 with note (where attention might have been called to the\ndifference that exists between the ish _t_ i and the animal sacrifice in\nregard to the formula by which the Adhvaryu calls for the recitation of the\noffering-prayer). In regard to this point there is, however, a difference of\nopinion between the Madhyandina and the Ka _n_ va schools, the latter using\nfor the Pa _s_ upuro _d_ a _s_ a on this occasion, as well as on that of the\nRa _g_ asuya, the same calls as those of the inserted ish _t_ is; cf. Katy.\n_S_ r. XV, 4, 18-20.\n\n[248:4](sbe4341.htm#fr_436) For the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, or oblation to Agni,\n'the maker of good offering,' offered after the chief oblations, see I, 7, 3,\n1 seq.; for the i _d_ a-oblation (and invocation of I _d_ a), I, 8, 1, 1 seq.\n\n[248:5](sbe4341.htm#fr_437) The tentative meaning assigned to 'asamavahitam,'\n'not in immediate connection with (the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t),' can scarcely be\nright. The clause seems simply to mean that the (purvabhisheka) touching p.\n249 of the altar is to take place, as in the case of the (preliminary)\nconsecration at the Ra _g_ asuya, immediately after the oblations to the\nDivine Quickeners, and before the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t oblation of the Pa _s_\nupuro _d_ a _s_ a has been performed. See V, 3, 3, 50, where a somewhat\nsimilar expression is used. One might have some doubt as to whether, both here\nand at the Ra _g_ asuya, there is any Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t at all to these\nDevasu-havi _m_ shi, or whether the statement, 'There is the same svish _t_ ak\n_ri_ t and the same i _d_ a,' applies not to them merely, but to them and the\nPa _s_ upuro _d_ a _s_ a. If this latter alternative were the correct one, we\nshould, however, expect that something had been said on this point in\nconnection with the Devasu oblations of the Ra _g_ asuya; and moreover the\nnature of the two oblations seems too different for such a partial\nidentification, requiring as they do different 'praishas,' or calls, in the\nSvish _t_ ak _ri_ t (viz. 'ya _g_ a' the one, and 'preshya' the other); see\nalso [IX, 5, 1, 40](sbe4343.htm#9:5:1:40), and note 3, p. 248; also Katy. _S_\nr. V, II, 23-24.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 4, 4.
