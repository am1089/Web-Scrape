Indra said :-- \xc2\x93O Prince! The King Haris\xc2\x92chandra promised before to Varu\n_n_ a that he would celebrate for his propitiation the great Naramedha\nsacrifice when he would offer his own son as a victim to be immolated. O\nPrince! You are very intelligent; can\xc2\x92t you grasp this idea that your father\nhas become merciless due to his suffering in this illness and no sooner you go\nthere than he will make you the victim and tie you\n\n\n\np. 527\n\n\n\nto the sacrificial post when you will be slaughtered.\xc2\x94 The indomitable Indra\nthus prohibiting the son, he began to stay there deluded by the Maya of the\ngreat Maha Maya. O King! Thus whenever the prince heard of his father\xc2\x92s severe\nillness, he wanted to go to his father, Indra repeatedly used to go to him and\nprevent him from doing so. On the other hand, the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra became\nvery much afflicted, and, seeing his family Guru all-knowing well-wisher Vas\xc2\x92i\n_st_ ha close by, asked him, \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! what am I to do now? I am now very\nimpatient with the agonies of this disease and am very weak; besides I am very\nmuch afraid of it. Kindly give me a good advice and save me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n7-9. Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha said :-- \xc2\x93O King! There is a good remedy for the cure of\nyour disease. It is stated in the S\xc2\x92astras that the sons are of thirteen\nkinds; Aurasa, K _s_ attraja, Datrima, Kritrima; etc. Therefore pay the\nreasonable price and buy one good Brahmi _n_ boy and perform your sacrifice\nwith that boy. O King! Thus Varu _n_ a will be pleased and you will be cured\nof your disease.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n10-24. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the words of Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, the\nKing Haris\xc2\x92chandra addressed to his minister :-- \xc2\x93O Minister-in-Chief! You are\nvery sharp and intelligent, therefore you better try your best and seek in my\nkingdom a Brahmi _n_ boy. In case a poor Brahmi _n_ be willing, out of his\nlove for money, to give over his son, then give him any amount he wants and\nbring his son. O Minister! By all means, bring a Brahmi _n_ boy for this\nsacrifice; in other words, do not be miserly or act lazily to perform my\nbusiness. You should pray to any Brahmin thus :-- Take this money and give\nyour son, who will be sacrificed in a sacrificial ceremony as a victim.\xc2\x94 Thus\nordered, the minister sought for a Brahmi _n_ boy in towns after towns,\nvillages after villages, and houses after houses. Till, at last, he came to\nknow that in his kingdom there was a poor distressed Brahmi _n_ named\nAjigarta, who had three sons. Then the minister gave to the Brahmi _n_ that he\nwanted and purchased his second son named S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha and brought him before\nthe King. And handed him over to the King, saying that this Brahmi _n_ boy is\nfit for the sacrificial victim. The King then gladly brought the best Brahmi\n_n_ s versed in the Vedas for the performance of the sacrifice, and collected\nall the articles requisite for the purpose. When the sacrifice was commenced,\nthe great Muni Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, seeing S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha tied, prohibited the King and\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O King! Do not be so bold as to sacrifice this boy; let this boy be\nfree. O long-lived One! I am asking this thing from you today and if you obey\nit, certainly it will do good to you. O King! This boy S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha is crying;\nhis cries are paining my heart and I am feeling pity for him. Hear my word and\nfree this\n\n\n\np. 528\n\n\n\nboy out of mercy. See! The purehearted K _s_ attriyas, in ancient days, used\nto sacrifice their own bodies and thus preserve others\xc2\x92 bodies, so that they\nmight attain the Heavens. And now you are killing this Brahmi _n_ boy forcibly\nso that you may preserve your own body; judge how vicious is this your act! Be\nmerciful to this boy. O King! Everyone likes his own body to the same extent;\nyou are feeling this yourself; therefore if you take my word, then quit this\nboy.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n25-36. Vyasa said :-- O King! The King Haris\xc2\x92chandra was ailing very much;\nhence be did not pay any heed to the Muni\xc2\x92s words and did not quit the boy.\nThereupon the very fiery spirited Vis\xc2\x92vamitra became very angry with the King.\nThen Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, the son of Kus\xc2\x92ika, the foremost of the knowers of the\nVedas, shewed mercy on S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha and gave him the \xc2\x93Varu _n_ a Mantram.\xc2\x94\nS\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha, very much afraid to lose his life, earnestly repeatedly\nremembered Varu _n_ a and uttered that mantram in pluta tone (lengthened or\nprolonged). Varu _n_ a, too, the ocean of mercy, knowing that the Brahmi _n_\nboy was praising him with hymns came up to that spot and freed S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha\nfrom his bondage and freed the King also from his disease and went back to his\nown abode. Thus the Mahar _s_ i Vis\xc2\x92vamitra became very glad to rescue the\nMuni\xc2\x92s son from the jaws of death. The King Haris\xc2\x92chandra did not observe the\nwords of Vis\xc2\x92vamitra; hence the son of Gadhi harboured within his heart anger\ntowards the King. One day while the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra was riding in a forest\nand there, at midday, on the banks of the river Kaus\xc2\x92ik, when he desired to\nkill a boar, Vis\xc2\x92vamitra in the garb of an old Brahmi _n_ asked from him\neverything that he had, including his dominion and thus cunningly took away\neverything from the King. The Mahar _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, seeing his Yajamana\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra suffering much, became wounded and felt pain in his mind. One\nday when he met casually with Vis\xc2\x92vamitra in a forest, he said :-- \xc2\x93O wicked K\n_s_ attriya! A disgrace to your family! You have in vain put on the garb of a\nBrahmi _n_ ; your religion is like a crane; you ate full of vanity; you boast\nfor nothing. The best of kings, Haris\xc2\x92chandra is my client; be is faultless;\nstill, O Fool! Why are you giving him so much trouble. As you are religious as\na crane is religious, so take your birth as a crane.\xc2\x94 Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, thus cursed\nby Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, cursed Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha in return, and said :-- \xc2\x93O Vas\xc2\x92i _st_\nha! As long as I will remain a crane, so long you also remain as S\xc2\x92arali or \xc3\x82\n_d_ i bird.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n37-42. Vyasa said :-- O King! The two angry Munis thus cursed each other and\nthe two were born as Crane and S\xc2\x92arali or \xc3\x82di bird. The crane Vis\xc2\x92vamitra\nbuilt its nest on the top of a tree on the Manasarovara lake and began to live\nthere. Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, too, assumed the form of an \xc3\x82di bird,\n\n\n\np. 529\n\n\n\nand built his nest on the top of another tree and lived there. Thus the two Ri\n_s_ is spent their days in full enmity towards each other. These two birds\nused to shriek so terribly loud that they became a nuisance to all; they\nfought daily with each other. They used to strike each other with beaks and\nwings and nails and thus they were covered all over their bodies with cuts and\nwounds and they were smeared with blood. They began to look like Kims\xc2\x92uka\ntrees. Thus the two Ri _s_ is, in the shape of birds, in their states of\nbondage, due to each other\xc2\x92s curse, passed many years there.\n\n\n\n43\\. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_ a! Kindly tell me how Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha and\nKaus\xc2\x92ika, the two Ri _s_ is, became free from their curses; I am very curious\nto hear this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n44-54. Vyasa said :-- Brahma, the Grandsire of his subjects, came there with\nall the Devas, filled with mercy, on seeing those two Ri _s_ is at war against\neach other. Brahma, the Lotus-seated, made them desist from such a fight,\nconsoled them and freed both of them from each other\xc2\x92s curses. Then the Devas\nwent back to their own abodes and the illustrious lotus-seated Brahma went to\nthe Satyaloka, seated on his Swan. Mahar _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha and Vis\xc2\x92vamitra\nbecame then friends and were tied with bonds of affection at the advice of\nBrahma; they went back to their own \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92ramas. O King! Now see, that the Mahar\n_s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, the son of Mitra-Varu _n_ a, fought for nothing with\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra, so painful to both the parties. Who, then, amongst the human\nbeings, the Danavas or the Devas can conquer his Ahamkara (egoism) and be\nalways happy? Therefore the Chitta-S\xc2\x92uddhi, the purity of the heart (that\npurity which imparts to man the blessedness of God-vision) is very difficult\neven for the high-souled persons; with the greatest caution and utmost effort\none has to practise for that. To those persons, that are void of this Chitta\nS\xc2\x92uddhi, it is all vain to go to places of pilgrimage, to make charities, to\npractise tapasya, to be truthful; in fact, anything, which is the means to\nattain Dharma, becomes useless. O King! S\xc2\x92raddha (Faith) is of three kinds :--\n(1) Sattviki, (2) Rajasiki and (3) Tamasiki to all persons in all their\nreligious matters. The Sattvik faith is the only one of the three that yields\nentire results; and it is very rare in this world. The Rajasik faith, done\naccording to due rules, yields half the results thereof and the Tamasik faith\nis fruitless and inglorious; the Tamasik faith arises with those persons that\nare overwhelmed with lust, anger, greed, etc. Therefore, O King! Keep to the\ncompany of the good and hear the S\xc2\x92astras, Vedanta, etc., and free the heart\nof worldly desires and then concentrate it to the worship of the Devi and live\nin a sacred place of pilgrimage. Men afraid and troubled with the defects of\nthe Kaliyuga, should always\n\n\n\np. 530\n\n\n\ntake the name of the Devi, sing praises, and meditate on Her lotus feet. Thus\nthe Jivas will not have any fear of Kali and the fallen vicious persons will\neasily be able to cross this ocean of the world and be free. There is no doubt\nin this.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirteenth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the description of the\nbattle between \xc3\x82 _d_ i and Baka after the discourse on S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha in S\xc2\x92ri\nMad Devi Bhagavatam, the Mahapura _n_ am of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 14](bk06ch14.htm)\n\n'
