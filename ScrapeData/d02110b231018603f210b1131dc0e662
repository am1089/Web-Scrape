But the (elements) beginning with light (are meant by the term a _g_ a);\nfor some read so in their text.\n\nBy the term a _g_ a we have to understand the causal matter of the four\nclasses of beings, which matter has sprung from the highest Lord and begins\nwith light, i.e. comprises fire, water, and earth.--The word 'but' (in the\nSutra) gives emphasis to the assertion.--This a _g_ a is to be considered as\ncomprising three elementary substances, not as consisting of three gu _n_ as\nin the Sa _n_ khya sense. We draw this conclusion from the fact that one _s_\nakha, after having related how fire, water, and earth sprang from the highest\nLord, assigns to them red colour, and so on. 'The red colour of burning fire\n\np. 255\n\n[paragraph continues] (agni) is the colour of the elementary fire (te _g_ as),\nits white colour is the colour of water, its black colour the colour of\nearth,' &c. Now those three elements--fire, water, and earth--we recognise in\nthe _S_ veta _s_ vatara passage, as the words red, white, and black are common\nto both passages, and as these words primarily denote special colours and can\nbe applied to the Sa _n_ khya gu _n_ as in a secondary sense only. That\npassages whose sense is beyond doubt are to be used for the interpretation of\ndoubtful passages, is a generally acknowledged rule. As we therefore find that\nin the _S_ veta _s_ vatara--after the general topic has been started in I, 1,\n'The Brahman-students say, Is Brahman the cause?'--the text, previous to the\npassage under discussion, speaks of a power of the highest Lord which arranges\nthe whole world ('the Sages devoted to meditation and concentration have seen\nthe power belonging to God himself, hidden in its own qualities'); and as\nfurther that same power is referred to in two subsequent complementary\npassages ('Know then, Prak _ri_ ti is Maya, and the great Lord he who is\naffected with Maya;' 'who being one only rules over every germ;' IV, 10, 11);\nit cannot possibly be asserted that the mantra treating of the a _g_ a refers\nto some independent causal matter called pradhana. We rather assert, on the\nground of the general subject-matter, that the mantra describes the same\ndivine power referred to in the other passages, in which names and forms lie\nunevolved, and which we assume as the antecedent condition of that state of\nthe world in which names and forms are evolved. And that divine power is\nrepresented as three-coloured, because its products, viz. fire, water, and\nearth, have three distinct colours.--But how can we maintain, on the ground of\nfire, water, and earth having three colours, that the causal matter is\nappropriately called a three-coloured a _g_ a? if we consider, on the one\nhand, that the exterior form of the genus a _g_ a (i.e. goat) does not inhere\nin fire, water, and earth; and, on the other hand, that Scripture teaches\nfire, water, and earth to have been produced, so that the word a _g_ a cannot\nbe taken in the sense 'non-produced 1.'--To this question the next Sutra\nreplies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[255:1](sbe34120.htm#fr_238) Here there seems to be a certain discrepancy\nbetween the p. 256 views of the Sutra writer and _S_ a _n_ kara. Govindananda\nnotes that according to the Bhashyak _ri_ t a _g_ a means simply maya\\--which\ninterpretation is based on prakara _n_ a--while, according to the Sutra-k _ri_\nt, who explains a _g_ a on the ground of the _Kh_ andogya-passage treating of\nthe three primary elements, a _g_ a denotes the aggregate of those three\nelements constituting an avantaraprak _ri_ ti.--On _S_ a _n_ kara's\nexplanation the term a _g_ a presents no difficulties, for maya is a _g_ a,\ni.e. unborn, not produced. On the explanation of the Sutra writer, however, a\n_g_ a cannot mean unborn, since the three primary elements are products. Hence\nwe are thrown back on the ru _dh_ i signification of a _g_ a, according to\nwhich it means she-goat. But how can the avantara-prak _ri_ ti be called a\nshe-goat? To this question the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 10](sbe34121.htm)\n\n"
