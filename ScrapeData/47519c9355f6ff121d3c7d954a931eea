In these five great elements, in the operations\nof (perceiving) sound, touch, colour, taste, and smell, creatures are deluded\n1. When, at the termination of the destruction of the great elements, the\nfinal dissolution approaches, O talented one! a great danger for all living\nbeings arises 2. Every entity is dissolved into that from which it is\nproduced. They are born one from the other, and are dissolved in the reverse\norder 3. Then when every entity, movable or immovable, has been dissolved, the\ntalented men who possess a (good) memory 4 are not dissolved at all. Sound,\ntouch, and likewise colour, taste, and smell as the fifth; the operations\n(connected with these) have causes 5, and are inconstant, and their name is\ndelusion. Caused by the production of avarice 6, not different from one\nanother 7, and insignificant 8, connected with flesh and blood, and depending\nupon one another,\n\np. 336\n\nexcluded from the self 1, these are helpless and powerless. The Pra _n_ a and\nthe Apana, the Udana, the Samana, and the Vyana also, these five winds are\nalso joined to the inner self 2, and together with speech, mind, and\nunderstanding make the eight constituents of the universe 3. He whose skin,\nnose, ear, eye, tongue, and speech are restrained, and whose mind is pure, and\nunderstanding unswerving 4, and whose mind is never burnt by these eight fires\n5, he attains to that holy Brahman than which nothing greater exists. And the\neleven organs, which are stated as having been produced from egoism--these, O\ntwice-born ones! I will describe specifically. The ear, the skin, the two\neyes, the tongue, the nose also as the fifth, the two feet, the organ of\nexcretion, and the organ of generation, the two hands, and speech as the\ntenth; such is the group of organs, the mind is the eleventh. This group one\nshould subdue first, then the Brahman shines (before him). Five (of these) are\ncalled the organs of perception, and five the\n\np. 337\n\norgans of action. The five beginning with the ear are truly said to be\nconnected with knowledge. And all the rest are without distinction connected\nwith action. The mind should be understood to be among both 1, and the\nunderstanding is the twelfth. Thus have been stated the eleven organs in\norder. Understanding these 2, learned men think they have accomplished\n(everything). I will now proceed to state all the various organs. Space 3 is\nthe first entity; as connected with the self it is called the ear; likewise as\nconnected with objects (it is) sound; and the presiding deity there is the\nquarters. The second entity is air; it is known as the skin as connected with\nthe self; as connected with objects (it is) the object of touch; and the\npresiding deity there is lightning. The third (entity) is said to be light; as\nconnected with the self it is called the eye; next as connected with objects\n(it is) colour; and the presiding deity there is the sun. The fourth (entity)\nshould be understood to be water; as connected with the self it is called the\ntongue; as connected with objects it is taste; and the presiding deity there\nis Soma. The fifth entity is earth; as connected with the self it is the nose;\nas connected with objects likewise it is smell; and the presiding deity there\nis the wind. Thus are the five entities stated to be divided among the three\n4. I will now proceed to state all the various organs.\n\np. 338\n\n[paragraph continues] As connected with the self, the feet are mentioned by\nBrahma _n_ as, who perceive the truth; as connected with objects it is motion;\nthe presiding deity there is Vish _n_ u. The Apana wind, the motion of which\nis downward, as connected with the self, is called the organ of excretion; as\nconnected with objects it is excretion 1; and the presiding deity there is\nMitra. As connected with the self the generative organ is mentioned, the\nproducer of all beings; as connected with objects it is the semen; and the\npresiding deity there is Pra _g_ apati. Men who understand the Adhyatma speak\nof the two hands as connected with the self; as connected with objects it is\nactions; and the presiding deity there is Indra. Then first, as connected with\nthe self, is speech which relates to all the gods; as connected with objects\nit is what is spoken; and the presiding deity there is fire. As connected with\nthe self they mention the mind, which follows after the five entities 2; as\nconnected with objects it is the mental operation; the presiding deity there\nis the- moon. Likewise (there is) egoism, the cause of the whole course of\nworldly life, as connected with the self; as connected with objects, self-\nconsciousness; the presiding deity there is Rudra. As connected with the self,\nthey mention the understanding impelling the six senses 3;\n\np. 339\n\nas connected with objects that which is to be understood; and the presiding\ndeity there is Brahman. There are three seats for all entities--a fourth is\nnot possible--land, water, and space. And the (mode of) birth is fourfold.\nThose born from eggs, those born from germs, those born from perspiration, and\nthose born from wombs-such is the fourfold (mode of) birth of the group of\nliving beings 1. Now there are the inferior beings and likewise those moving\nin the air. Those should be understood to be born from eggs, as also all\nreptiles. Insects are said to be born from perspiration; and worms of the like\ndescription. This is said to be the second (mode of) birth, and inferior.\nThose beings, however, which are born after the lapse of some time, bursting\nthrough the earth, are said to be born from germs, O best of the twice-born!\nBeings of two feet or more than two feet, and those which move crookedly, are\nthe beings born from wombs. Understand about them also, O best of men! The\neternal seat (where) the Brahman 2 (is to be attained) should be understood to\nbe twofold-penance 3 and meritorious action. Such is the doctrine of the\nlearned. Action should be understood to be of various 4\n\np. 340\n\ndescriptions, (namely) sacrifice, gift at a sacrifice, and sacred study 1, for\n(every one) who is born 2. Such is the teaching of the ancients. He who duly\nunderstands this, becomes possessed of concentration of mind, O chief of the\ntwice-born! and know, too, that he is released from all sins. Space 3 is the\nfirst entity; as connected with the (individual) self it is called the ear; as\nconnected with objects likewise it is called sound; and the presiding deity\nthere is the quarters. The second entity is air; as connected with the\n(individual) self it is called the skin; as connected with objects it is the\nobject of touch; and the presiding deity there is the lightning. The third is\ncalled light; as connected with the (individual) self it is laid down to be\nthe eye; next as connected with objects it is colour; the presiding deity\nthere is the sun. The fourth should be understood to be water; as connected\nwith the (individual) self it is stated to be the tongue; as connected with\nobjects it should be understood to be taste; the presiding deity there is\nSoma. The fifth element is earth; as connected with the (individual) self it\nis called the nose; as connected with objects likewise it is called smell; the\npresiding deity there is Vayu. Thus have I\n\np. 341\n\naccurately described to you the creation 1 as connected with the (individual)\nself. A knowledge of this, O ye who understand piety! is here obtained by\nthose who possess knowledge. One should place all these together, (viz.) the\nsenses, the objects of the senses, and the five great elements, and hold them\nby the mind 2. When everything is absorbed into the mind, the pleasures of\n(worldly) life 3 are not esteemed. The learned (men) whose understandings are\npossessed of knowledge esteem the pleasure derived from that 4. Now 5 I shall\nproceed to describe that discarding of all entities by (means) gentle and hard\n6, which produces attachment to subtle 7 (topics), and is sanctifying. The\n(mode of) conduct in which qualities are not (treated as) qualities 8, which\nis free from attachment, in which one lives alone 9, which is uninterrupted\n10, and which is full of the Brahman 11, is called happiness (dwelling) in one\naggregate 12.\n\np. 342\n\nThe learned man who absorbs objects of desire from all sides, as a tortoise\n(draws in) his limbs 1, and who is devoid of passion, and released from\neverything 2, is ever happy. Restraining objects of desire within the self 3,\nhe becomes fit for assimilation with the Brahman 4, having his cravings\ndestroyed, and being concentrated in mind, and friendly and affectionate 5 to\nall beings. The fire of the Adhyatma 6 is kindled in a sage by his abandoning\nthe country 7, and by the restraint of all the senses which hanker after\nobjects of sense. As fire kindled with fuel shines forth with a great blaze,\nso the great self 8 shines forth through the restraint of the senses. When one\nwith a tranquil self perceives all entities in one's own heart. then being\nself-illumined 9, one attains to that which is subtler than (the most) subtle\n(thing) 10, and than which there is nothing higher. It is settled, that the\nbody in which the colour 11 is fire, the flowing 12\n\np. 343\n\n(element) water, and the feeling of touch is air, the hideous holder of the\nmud 1 is earth, and likewise the sound is space; which is pervaded by disease\nand sorrow; which is surrounded by the five currents 2; which is made up of\nthe five elements; which has nine passages 3 and two deities 4; which is full\nof passion; unfit to be seen 5; made up of three qualities and of three\nconstituent elements 6; pleased with contacts 7; and full of delusion 8; this\nsame (body), which is difficult to move in this mortal world, and which rests\non the real (entity) 9, is the very wheel of time which rotates in this world\n10. It is a great ocean, fearful and unfathomable, and is named 11 delusion.\nThe world, together with the immortals, should cast it aside, curtail it,\n\np. 344\n\nand restrain it 1. Desire, wrath, fear, avarice, treachery, and falsehood\nalso, (all these), which are difficult to get rid of, the good do get rid of\nby restraint of the senses 2. And he who in this world has vanquished the\nthree qualities and the five constituent elements 3, obtains the highest\n4\\--the infinite-seat in heaven. Crossing the river of which the five senses\nare the lofty banks, the agitation of mind 5 the mighty waters, and delusion\nthe reservoir 6, one should vanquish both desire and wrath. Freed from all\nsins, he, then perceives that highest (principle), concentrating the mind\nwithin the mind 7, and seeing the self within the self 8. Understanding\neverything, he sees the self with the self in all entities as one 9, and also\nas various,\n\np. 345\n\nchanging from time to time [1](sbe0855.htm#fn_1702). He can always perceive\n(numerous) bodies like a hundred lights from one light. He verily is Vish _n_\nu, and Mitra, and Varuna, Agni, and Pra _g_ apati. He is the supporter, and\nthe creator. He is the lord whose faces ale in all directions\n[2](sbe0855.htm#fn_1703). (In him) the great self--the heart of all beings--is\nresplendent. Him, all companies of Brahma _n_ as, and also gods, and demons,\nand Yakshas, and Pisa _k_ as, and Pit _ri_ s, and birds, and the bands of\nRakshases, and the bands of Bhutas [3](sbe0855.htm#fn_1704), and also all the\ngreat sages, ever extol.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[335:1](sbe0854.htm#fr_1638) The contact of the objects of sense with the\nsenses is the source of delusion.\n\n[335:2](sbe0854.htm#fr_1639) Cf. Gita, [p. 107](sbe0816.htm#page_107), and\nnote  [1](sbe0816.htm#fn_444) there.\n\n[335:3](sbe0854.htm#fr_1640) Cf. Sa _n_ khya-sutra I, 121, and [p.\n387](sbe0863.htm#page_387) infra.\n\n[335:4](sbe0854.htm#fr_1641) I.e. knowledge of the truth, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra.\n\n[335:5](sbe0854.htm#fr_1642) Hence, as they have a beginning, they also must\nhave an end and hence they are inconstant.\n\n[335:6](sbe0854.htm#fr_1643) This and following epithets expand the idea of\ninconstancy.\n\n[335:7](sbe0854.htm#fr_1644) Being all in substance connected with the Prak\n_ri_ ti, the material world, so to say.\n\n[335:8](sbe0854.htm#fr_1645) Containing no reality, Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[336:1](sbe0854.htm#fr_1646) Nilaka _nth_ a apparently takes the original here\nto mean of gross nature, not, subtle, such as anything connected with the self\nwould be. They are helpless and powerless without support from other\nprinciples, and mainly the self.\n\n[336:2](sbe0854.htm#fr_1647) He here states what is more closely connected\nwith the self, and, as Nilaka _nth_ a puts it, accompanies the self till final\nemancipation. The inner self Nilaka _nth_ a takes to mean the self associated\nwith egoism or self-consciousness.\n\n[336:3](sbe0854.htm#fr_1648) Nilaka _nth_ a cites certain texts to show that\nthe perceptive senses work only through the mind, and that the objects of the\nsenses are produced from the senses, and hence the universe, he says, is\nconstituted of the eight enumerated above.\n\n[336:4](sbe0854.htm#fr_1649) I. e. from the truth.\n\n[336:5](sbe0854.htm#fr_1650) I. e. vexed by the operations of any of these.\n\n[337:1](sbe0854.htm#fr_1651) Cf. Sa _n_ khya-karika 2 7; Sa _n_ khya-sara, p.\n17.\n\n[337:2](sbe0854.htm#fr_1652) Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 148.\n\n[337:3](sbe0854.htm#fr_1653) Cf. Lalita Vistara (translated by Dr. R. Mitra),\np. 11.\n\n[337:4](sbe0854.htm#fr_1654) The above sentences show the entities in the\nthree different aspects mentioned, which correspond to each other; the ear is\nthe sense, that which is connected with the self; sound is the object of that\nsense, as connected with the external world; and the p. 338 quarters, Dik, are\nthe deities presiding over the senses; as to this cf. Sa _n_ khya-sara, p. 17,\nand Vedanta Paribhasha, p. 45, which show some discrepancies. The distinctions\nof Adhyatma &c. are to be found in the Upanishads; cf. inter alia, _Kh_\nandogya, p. 227, and cf. Gita, [p. 77](sbe0809.htm#page_77).\n\n[338:1](sbe0854.htm#fr_1655) As to the original word, cf. inter alia, _S_ veta\n_s_ vatara, pp. 197-202.\n\n[338:2](sbe0854.htm#fr_1656) This probably means the five senses which can\nperceive only when associated with the mind. See [p.\n268](sbe0834.htm#page_268) supra.\n\n[338:3](sbe0854.htm#fr_1657) The understanding is called the charioteer at Ka\n_th_ a, p. 111.\n\n[339:1](sbe0854.htm#fr_1658) Cf. _Kh_ andogya, pp. 404-406, and glosses;\nAitareya, p. 243; Vedanta Paribhasha, p. 47; Sa _n_ khya-sutra V, 111; Manu.\nI, 43; Max Muller's note at p. 94 of his _Kh_ andogya in this series.\n\n[339:2](sbe0854.htm#fr_1659) So Nilaka _nth_ a, but he also adds that this\nmeans birth as a Brahma _n_ a, which seems to be quite wrong. Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra's 'means of acquiring Brahman' is right. See [p.\n369](sbe0859.htm#page_369) infra.\n\n[339:3](sbe0854.htm#fr_1660) I. e., I presume, 'knowledge.' _S_ a _n_ kara has\nso interpreted the word at Mu _nd_ aka, p. 270, and Ka _th_ a, p. 127, and\nelsewhere; and see Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p. 166](sbe0824.htm#page_166) supra.\n\n[339:4](sbe0854.htm#fr_1661) Another reading is 'of two kinds.' But I prefer\nthis, as three kinds are mentioned further on.\n\n[340:1](sbe0854.htm#fr_1662) Cf. as to this _Kh_ andogya, p. 136, which\njustifies our rendering, though the commentator Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra seems to\nunderstand the passage differently.\n\n[340:2](sbe0854.htm#fr_1663) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra seems to understand this to\nmean 'twice-born.'\n\n[340:3](sbe0854.htm#fr_1664) This is a repetition of what occurs at p. 337,\nand apparently is spurious. But two of the MSS., both those containing\ncommentaries, contain the passage twice. One of the other MSS. omits the\npassage where it occurs before, and has it here. I think that the passage is\nin its place before, and probably interpolated here.\n\n[341:1](sbe0854.htm#fr_1665) I am not quite sure that this is a correct\nrendering. But I can think of none better, and the commentators afford no\nhelp.\n\n[341:2](sbe0854.htm#fr_1666) Nilaka _nth_ a says, 'Thinking that the great\nelements are not distinct from the senses, one should hold them absorbed in\nthe mind.' Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, 'In the mind as their seat they should\nbe placed,' as being not distinct from the mind, I presume. Cf. Ka _th_ a, p.\n148.\n\n[341:3](sbe0854.htm#fr_1667) Literally,' birth.'\n\n[341:4](sbe0854.htm#fr_1668) From knowledge, I presume. The commentators\nafford no help.\n\n[341:5](sbe0854.htm#fr_1669) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's text appears to commence a\nnew chapter here.\n\n[341:6](sbe0854.htm#fr_1670) Such as meditation or upasana, and pra _n_ ayama\nor restraint of life-winds respectively, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[341:7](sbe0854.htm#fr_1671) Cf. [p. 310](sbe0846.htm#page_310) supra.\n\n[341:8](sbe0854.htm#fr_1672) I. e. bravery, learning, &c. are treated as not\nbeing merits, as they cause pride, &c., Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[341:9](sbe0854.htm#fr_1673) I. e. in solitude, Nilaka _nth_ a; devoting\noneself to the self` only, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Cf. also [p.\n284](sbe0838.htm#page_284) supra, note  [4](sbe0839.htm#fn_1364).\n\n[341:10](sbe0854.htm#fr_1674) Or, says Nilaka _nth_ a, free from any belief in\ndistinctions.\n\n[341:11](sbe0854.htm#fr_1675) Another reading would mean 'which exists among\nBrahma _n_ as.'\n\n[341:12](sbe0854.htm#fr_1676) I. e. all collected together, I presume.\n\n[342:1](sbe0854.htm#fr_1677) Cf. Gita, pp. [50](sbe0804.htm#page_50),\n[51](sbe0804.htm#page_51), and _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha Dharma) I, 51, where\nthe phrase is precisely the same as here.\n\n[342:2](sbe0854.htm#fr_1678) I. e. from all bonds, I suppose. See [p.\n292](sbe0840.htm#page_292) supra.\n\n[342:3](sbe0854.htm#fr_1679) Cf. Gita, [p. 51](sbe0804.htm#page_51).\n\n[342:4](sbe0854.htm#fr_1680) Cf. Gita, [p. 110](sbe0816.htm#page_110).\n\n[342:5](sbe0854.htm#fr_1681) Cf. Gita, [p. 68](sbe0808.htm#page_68).\n\n[342:6](sbe0854.htm#fr_1682) I. e. experience, Nilaka _nth_ a. It means direct\nperception of the relations between the supreme and individual self, Cf. Gita,\n[p. 111](sbe0817.htm#page_111).\n\n[342:7](sbe0854.htm#fr_1683) As opposed to forests. See Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p.\n159](sbe0823.htm#page_159), note 9.\n\n[342:8](sbe0854.htm#fr_1684) This must mean here the supreme self, apparently.\n\n[342:9](sbe0854.htm#fr_1685) I. e. being devoted to the self only, Ar _g_ una\nMi _s_ ra. The ordinary meaning of the word, however, is one who has direct\nexperience or perception without the aid of senses, &c. Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_\nyaka, p. 765, and _S_ ariraka Bhashya, pp. 648, 784, &c.\n\n[342:10](sbe0854.htm#fr_1686) Nilaka _nth_ a says, 'The supreme Brahman which\nis subtler than the Brahman within the lotus-like heart.'\n\n[342:11](sbe0854.htm#fr_1687) I. e. that which perceives colour, viz. the\nsense, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. This applies to the analogous words coming\nfurther on.\n\n[342:12](sbe0854.htm#fr_1688) I. e. taste, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, which\nseems to be more correct than Nilaka _nth_ a's blood and such other liquid\nelements of the body.\n\n[343:1](sbe0854.htm#fr_1689) I. e. the flesh, bone, and so forth, Nilaka _nth_\na; the mucus in the nose, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[343:2](sbe0854.htm#fr_1690) I. e. the senses. Cf. [p.\n238](sbe0829.htm#page_238) supra, note  [7](sbe0829.htm#fn_1090).\n\n[343:3](sbe0854.htm#fr_1691) Cf. Gita, [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65).\n\n[343:4](sbe0854.htm#fr_1692) See Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p.\n187](sbe0826.htm#page_187) supra.\n\n[343:5](sbe0854.htm#fr_1693) As being unholy, Nilaka _nth_ a; as the bodies of\nKa _nd_ alas &c, when seen are productive of sin, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. See\n[p. 155](sbe0823.htm#page_155) supra.\n\n[343:6](sbe0854.htm#fr_1694) Viz. vata, pitta, _s_ leshma, or wind, bile,, and\nphlegm. The dhatus are sometimes spoken of as seven. See Yoga-sutras, p. 192;\nTaitt. \xc3\x82r. p. 874, commentary, and [p. 246](sbe0831.htm#page_246) supra. See,\ntoo, however, _S_ veta _s_ vatara, commentary, p. 287.\n\n[343:7](sbe0854.htm#fr_1695) Which is delighted only by contact with food and\nso forth, not otherwise, Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[343:8](sbe0854.htm#fr_1696) I. e. cause of delusion. The original word for\n'it is settled' at the beginning of this sentence is otherwise rendered by Ar\n_g_ una Mi _s_ ra. He takes it to mean in this light (namely, as above stated)\n'should one contemplate the body.' The other rendering is Nilaka _nth_ a's.\n\n[343:9](sbe0854.htm#fr_1697) I. e. the self, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra; the\nunderstanding, Nilaka _nth_ a difficult to move = difficult to adjust if\nattacked by disease, &c., Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[343:10](sbe0854.htm#fr_1698) It is owing to this body that the self becomes\nlimited by time, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Nilaka _nth_ a's gloss I do not follow.\nCf. [p. 187](sbe0826.htm#page_187) supra, and [p. 355](sbe0856.htm#page_355)\ninfra.\n\n[343:11](sbe0854.htm#fr_1699) I. e., Characterised by delusion, Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra.\n\n[344:1](sbe0854.htm#fr_1700) I am not sure about the meaning here. Ar _g_ una\nMi _s_ ra says, (reading vi _s_ riget, 'send forth,' for vikshipet, 'cast\naside,') 'send forth at the creation, curtail at the dissolution, and restrain\nat the final emancipation.' The commentary reads rodhayet, which we have\nadopted above. The text in the same copy, however, is bodhayet. Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra adds, as far as I can make out from an incorrect copy: 'as in this life\neverything is accomplished by these actions' (namely, I suppose, the casting\naside, &c.) Nilaka _nth_ a says, 'This same thing is the cause of creation,\ndestruction, and knowledge,' reading bodhayet.\n\n[344:2](sbe0854.htm#fr_1701) Cf.
