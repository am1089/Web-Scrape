'A Ha _m_ sa (flamingo, meant for the sun) will declare to you another\nfoot of Brahman.'\n\n(After these words of Agni), Satyakama, on the morrow, drove the cows onward.\nAnd when they came towards the evening, he lighted a fire, penned the cows,\nlaid wood on the fire, and sat down behind the fire, looking toward the east.\n\n2\\. Then a Ha _m_ sa flew near and said to him 'Satyakama.' He replied: 'Sir.'\n\n3\\. The Ha _m_ sa said: 'Friend, I will declare unto you one foot of Brahman.'\n\n'Declare it, Sir,' he replied.\n\nHe said to him: 'Fire is one quarter, the sun is one quarter, the moon is one\nquarter, lightning is one quarter. This is a foot of Brahman, consisting of\nfour quarters, and called _G_ yotishmat (full of light).\n\np. 63\n\n4\\. 'He who knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting of\nfour quarters, by the name of _G_ yotishmat, becomes full of light in this\nworld. He conquers the worlds which are full of light, whoever knows this and\nmeditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting of four quarters, by the name of\n_G_ yotishmat.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 8](sbe01085.htm)\n\n"
