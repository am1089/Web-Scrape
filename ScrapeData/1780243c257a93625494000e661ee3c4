VI.\n\nKrishn\xcc\x81a overturns a waggon; casts down two trees. The Gopas depart to\nVrindavana. Sports of the boys. Description of the season of the rains.\n\nON one occasion, whilst Madhusudana was asleep underneath the waggon, he cried\nfor the breast, and kicking up his feet he overturned the vehicle, and all the\npots and pans were upset and broken. The cowherds and their wives, hearing the\nnoise, came exclaiming, "Ah! ah!" and there they found the child sleeping on\nhis back. "Who could have upset the waggon?" said the cowherds. "This child,"\nreplied some boys, who witnessed the circumstance; "we saw him," said they,\n"crying, and kicking the waggon with his feet, and so it was overturned: no\none else had any thing to do with it." The cowherds were exceedingly\nastonished at this account; and Nanda, not knowing what to think, took up the\nboy; whilst Ya\xc5\x9boda offered worship to the broken pieces of pots and to the\nwaggon, with curds, flowers, fruit, and unbruised grain.\n\nThe initiatory rites requisite for the two boys were performed by Garga, who\nwas sent to Gokula by Vasudeva for that purpose: he celebrated them without\nthe knowledge of the cowherds 1; and the wise sage, eminent amongst the wise,\nnamed the elder of them Rama, and the other Krishn\xcc\x81a. In a short time they\nbegan to crawl about the ground, supporting themselves on their hands and\nknees, and creeping every where, often amidst ashes and filth. Neither Rohin\xcc\x81i\nnor Ya\xc5\x9boda was able to prevent them from getting into the cowpens, or amongst\nthe calves, where they amused themselves by pulling their tails. As they\ndisregarded the prohibitions of Ya\xc5\x9boda, and rambled about together constantly,\nshe became angry, and taking up a stick, followed them, and threatened the\ndark-complexioned Krishn\xcc\x81a with a whipping. Fastening a cord round his waist,\nshe tied him to the wooden mortar 2, and being in\n\np. 509\n\na great passion, she said to him, "Now, you naughty boy, get away from hence\nif you can." She then went about her domestic affairs. As soon as she had\ndeparted, the lotus-eyed Krishn\xcc\x81a, endeavouring to extricate himself, pulled\nthe mortar after him to the space between two Arjuna trees that grew near\ntogether: having dragged the mortar between these trees, it became wedged awry\nthere, and as Krishn\xcc\x81a pulled it through, it pulled down the trunks of the\ntrees. Hearing the crackling noise, the people of Vraja came to see what was\nthe matter, and there they beheld the two large trees, with shattered stems\nand broken branches, prostrate on the ground, with the child fixed between\nthem, with a rope round his belly, laughing, and shewing his white little\nteeth, just budded. It is hence that Krishn\xcc\x81a is called Damodara, from the\nbinding of the rope (dama) round his belly (udara) 3. The elders of the\ncowherds, with Nanda at their head, looked upon these circumstances with\nalarm, considering them as of evil omen. "We cannot remain in this place,"\nsaid they; "let us go to some other part of the forest; for here many evil\nsigns threaten us with destruction; the death of Putana, the upsetting of the\nwaggon, and the fall of the trees without their being blown down by the wind.\nLet us depart hence without delay, and go to Vrindavana, where terrestrial\nprodigies may no more disturb us."\n\nHaving thus resolved, the inhabitants of Vraja communicated their intention to\ntheir families, and desired them to move without delay. Accordingly they set\noff with their waggons and their cattle, driving before them their bulls and\ncows and calves; the fragments of their household stores they threw away, and\nin an instant Vraja was overspread with flights of crows. Vrindavana was\nchosen by Krishn\xcc\x81a, whom acts do not affect, for the sake of providing for the\nnourishment of the\n\np. 510\n\nkine; for there in the hottest season the new grass springs up as verdantly as\nin the rains. Having repaired, then, from Vraja to Vrindavana, the inhabitants\nof the former drew up their waggons in the form of a crescent 4.\n\nAs the two boys, Rama and Damodara, grew up, they were ever together in the\nsame place, and engaged in the same boyish sports. They made themselves crests\nof the peacocks\' plumes, and garlands of forest flowers, and musical\ninstruments of leaves and reeds, or played upon the pipes used by the\ncowherds: their hair was trimmed like the wings of the crow 5, and they\nresembled two young princes, portions of the deity of war: they were robust,\nand they roamed about, always laughing and playing, sometimes with each other,\nsometimes with other boys; driving along with the young cowherds the calves to\npasture. Thus the two guardians of the world were keepers of cattle, until\nthey had attained seven years of age, in the cow-pens of Vrindavan.\n\nThen came on the season of the rains, when the atmosphere laboured with\naccumulated clouds, and the quarters of the horizon were blended into one by\nthe driving showers. The waters of the rivers rose, and overflowed their\nbanks, and spread beyond all bounds, like the minds of the weak and wicked\ntransported beyond restraint by sudden prosperity. The pure radiance of the\nmoon was obscured by heavy vapours, as the lessons of holy writ are darkened\nby the arrogant scoffs of fools (and unbelievers). The bow of Indra held its\nplace in the heavens all unstrung, like a worthless man elevated by an\ninjudicious prince to honour. The white line of storks appeared upon the back\nof the cloud, in such contrast as the bright conduct of a man of\nrespectability opposes to the behaviour of a scoundrel. The ever-fitful\nlightning, in its new alliance with the sky, was like the friendship of a\nprofligate for a man\n\np. 511\n\nof worth. Overgrown by the spreading grain, the paths were indistinctly\ntraced, like the speech of the ignorant, that conveys no positive meaning.\n\nAt this time Krishn\xcc\x81a and Rama, accompanied by the cow-boys, traversed the\nforests, that echoed with the hum of bees and the peacock\'s cry. Sometimes\nthey sang in chorus, or danced together; sometimes they sought shelter from\nthe cold beneath the trees; sometimes they decorated themselves with flowery\ngarlands, sometimes with peacocks\' feathers; sometimes they stained themselves\nof various hues with the minerals of the mountain; sometimes weary they\nreposed on beds of leaves, and sometimes imitated in mirth the muttering of\nthe thundercloud; sometimes they excited their juvenile associates to sing,\nand sometimes they mimicked the cry of the peacock with their pipes. In this\nmanner participating in various feelings and emotions, and affectionately\nattached to each other, they wandered, sporting and happy, through the wood.\nAt eveningtide came Krishn\xcc\x81a and Balarama, like two cow-boys, along with the\ncows and the cowherds. At eveningtide the two immortals, having come to the\ncow-pens, joined heartily in whatever sports amused the sons of the herdsmen.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[508:1](vp123.htm#fr_1471) The Bhagavata describes Garga\'s interview with\nNanda, and the inducements of the latter to keep the former\'s celebration of\nthe Sanskaras, or initiatory rites of the two boys, secret from the Gopas.\nGarga there describes himself as the Purdhit, or family priest, of the\nYadavas.\n\n[508:2](vp123.htm#fr_1472) The Ulukhala, or mortar is a large p. 509 wooden\nbowl on a solid stand of timber, both cut out of one piece; the pestle is also\nof wood; and they are used chiefly for bruising or threshing unwinnowed corn,\nand separating the chaff from the grain. As important agents in household\neconomy, they are regarded as sacred, and even hymned in the Vedas.\n\n[509:3](vp123.htm#fr_1473) Our text, and that of the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, take no\nnotice of the legend of Nalakuvera and Man\xcc\x81igriva, sons of Kuvera, who,\naccording to the Bhagavata, had been metamorphosed, through a curse of Narada,\ninto these two trees, and for whose liberation this feat of Krishn\xcc\x81a was\nintended.\n\n[510:4](vp123.htm#fr_1474) The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, not satisfied with the prodigies\nwhich had alarmed the cowherds, adds another, not found, it is believed, any\nwhere else. The emigration, according to that work, originates, not with the\nGopas, but the two boys, who wish to go to Vrindavana, and in order to compel\nthe removal, Krishn\xcc\x81a converts the hairs of his body into hundreds of wolves,\nwho so harass and alarm the inhabitants of Vraja, that they determine to\nabandon their homes.\n\n[510:5](vp123.htm#fr_1475) The Kaka-paksha, or crow\'s wing, implies the hair\nleft on each side of the head, the top being shaved.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VII](vp124.htm)\n\n'
