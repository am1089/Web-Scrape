And some (state the Self to be) the shaper (creator); sons and so on\n(being the lovely things which he shapes).\n\nMoreover the members of one _s_ akha state that the Self is, in that\nintermediate state, the shaper of lovely things, 'He, the person who is awake\nin us while we are asleep, shaping one lovely thing after another' (Ka. Up.\nII, 5, 8).\n\np. 134\n\n[paragraph continues] Kama (lovely things) in this passage means sons, &c.,\nthat are so called because they are beloved.--But may not the term 'kama _h_ '\ndenote desires merely?--No, we reply; the word kama is here used with\nreference to sons, &c.; for those form the general subject of discussion, as\nwe see from some preceding passages, 'Choose sons and grandsons,' &c., and 'I\nmake thee the enjoyer of all kamas' (Ka. Up. I, 1, 23; 24).--And that that\nshaper is the highest Self (pra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a) we infer from the general subject-\nmatter and from the complementary sentence. That the highest Self is the\ngeneral subject-matter appears from II, 14, 'That which thou seest as neither\nthis nor that.' And to that highest Self there also refers the complementary\nsentence II, 5, 8, 'That indeed is the Bright, that is Brahman, that alone is\ncalled the Immortal. All worlds are contained in it, and no one goes beyond.'\n--Now it is admitted that the world (creation) of our waking state of which\nthe highest Self (pra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a) is the maker is real; hence the world of our\ndreaming state must likewise be real. That the same reasoning applies to the\nwaking and the sleeping state a scriptural passage also declares, 'Here they\nsay: No, this is the same as the place of waking, for what he sees while awake\nthe same he sees while asleep' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 14).--Hence the world of\ndreams is real.--To this we reply as follows.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 3](sbe38106.htm)\n\n"
