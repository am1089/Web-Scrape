Let me drink  \nTheir lifeblood as to earth they sink.'  \n   Then Khara, by his sister pressed,  \nInflamed with fury, gave his hest  \nTo twice seven giants of his crew,  \nFierce as the God of death to view:  \n   'Two men equipped with arms, who wear  \nDeerskin and bark and matted hair,  \nLeading a beauteous dame, have strayed  \nTo the wild gloom of Dandak's shade.  \nThese men, this cursed woman slay,  \nAnd hasten back without delay,  \nThat this my sister's lips may be  \nRed with the lifeblood of the three.  \nGiants, my wounded sister longs  \nTo take this vengeance for her wrongs.  \nWith speed her dearest wish fulfil,  \nAnd with your might these creatures kill.  \nSoon as your matchless strength shall lay  \nThese brothers dead in battle fray,  \nShe in triumphant joy will laugh,  \nAnd their hearts' blood delighted quaff.'  \n   The giants heard the words he said,  \nAnd forth with S'urpanakha sped,  \nAs mighty clouds in autumn fly  \nUrged by the wind along the sky.  \n\n        * * * * *  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[252:1](ry217.htm#fr_459) A demon slain by Indra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XX.: The Giants' Death.](ry218.htm)\n\n"
