Then the mother, having dressed the son in a clean garment, hands him,\nfrom south to north, with his face turned to the north, to the father.\n\np. 57\n\n3\\. She then passes behind his back and stations herself to the north (of her\nhusband).\n\n4\\. He then murmurs (the three verses), 'Thy heart, O thou whose hair is well\nparted' (MB. I, 5, 10-12), and after he has, with the words (standing at the\nend of verse 12), 'That this son may not come to harm (and thus be torn) from\nhis mother'\xc2\x97\n\n5\\. Handed him, from south to north, to his mother, they may do what they\nlike.\n\n6. 6 Then in the following bright fortnights (at the time) stated above (Sutra I), the father, filling his joined hands with water and turning his face towards the moon, worships it\xc2\x97\n\n7\\. Letting (the water) flow (out of his joined hands) once with the Ya _g_\nus, 'What in the moon' (MB. I, 5, 13), and twice silently. Then they may do\nwhat they like.\n\n8. 8 When ten nights have elapsed after (the child's) birth, or a hundred nights, or one year, the Namadheyakara _n_ a (or giving a name to the child, is performed).\n\n9\\. He who is going to perform (that ceremony\xc2\x97the father or a representative\nof the father), sits down to the west of the fire on northward-pointed Darbha\ngrass, facing the east.\n\n10. 10 Then the mother, having dressed the son in a clean garment, hands him, from south to north,\n\np. 58\n\nwith his face turned to the north, to the performer (of the ceremony).\n\n11\\. She then passes behind his back and sits down to the north (of him), on\nnorthward-pointed Darbha grass.\n\n12. 12 He then sacrifices to Pra _g_ apati, to the Tithi (of the child's birth), to the Nakshatra (of the child's birth), and to the (presiding) deity (of that Tithi and of that Nakshatra).\n\n13\\. He then murmurs the Mantra, 'Who art thou? What person art thou?' (MB. I,\n5, 14. 15), touching the sense-organs at (the boy's) head.\n\n14. 14 In (the passage of the Mantra), 'Enter upon the month, that belongs to Ahaspati (i.e. the lord of days), N.N.!' and at the end of the Mantra he should give him a name beginning with a sonant, with a semivowel in it, with a long vowel or the Visarga at the end, (and formed with) a K _ri_ t (suffix).\n\n15\\. It should not contain a Taddhita (suffix).\n\n16\\. (He should give a name with) an odd (number of syllables), ending in -da,\nto girls.\n\n17\\. And after he has told the name to the mother first, they may do what they\nlike.\n\n18\\. A cow constitutes the sacrificial fee.\n\n19. 19 Every month (after the birth) of the boy, (or)\n\np. 59\n\nafter one year, or on the Parvan days of the year (i.e. on the last Tithi of\neach of the three seasons) he should sacrifice to Agni and Indra, to Heaven\nand Earth, and to the Vi _s_ ve devas.\n\n20. 20 Having sacrificed to the deity (of the Tithi and of the Nakshatra respectively), he should sacrifice to the Tithi and to the Nakshatra.\n\n21. 21 When (the father) returns from a journey, or when (the son) begins to know, 'This is my father,' or when (the son) has been initiated, (the father) should grasp with his two hands his son round the head, and should murmur, 'From limb by limb thou art produced' (MB. I, 5, 16-18).\n\n22\\. With (the formula), 'With the cattle's hi _m_ kara I kiss thee' (l.l. 19)\nhe should kiss him. Then he may do what he likes.\n\n23\\. In the same way (he should do) to his younger sons\xc2\x97\n\n24\\. According to their age or in the order in which he meets them.\n\n25. 25 Girls he should silently kiss on their head; he should silently kiss them on their head.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[56:1](sbe30020.htm#fr_231) 8, 1 seq.

The position of the words in Sutra 21 is irregular, so as to\nraise the suspicion that the words yada va. . . . upetasya vi ('or when the\nson begins to know . . . has been initiated') are an insertion into the text\nof Gobhila, made by a later compiler, or into a more ancient text, made by\nGobhila himself.
