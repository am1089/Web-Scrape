The absence of that takes place in the na _d_ is and in the Self,\naccording to scriptural statement.\n\nNext the state of deep dreamless sleep is enquired into. Scripture says, 'When\na man is asleep, reposing and at perfect rest, so that he sees no dream, then\nhe lies asleep in those na _d_ is' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 6, 3); 'When he is in\nprofound sleep and is conscious of nothing, there are seventy-two thousand\nveins called hita which from the heart spread through the pericardium. Through\nthem he moves forth and rests in the pericardium' (B _ri_. Up. II, 1, 19).\n'When a man sleeps here, he becomes united with the True' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8,\n1). These texts declare the veins, the pericardium, and Brahman to be the\nplace of deep sleep; and hence there is a doubt whether each of them in turns,\nor all of them together, are that place. There is an option between them,\nsince they are not in mutual dependence, and since the sleeping soul cannot at\nthe same time be in several places!--To this the Sutra replies--the absence of\ndreams, i.e. deep sleep takes place in the veins, in the pericardium, and in\nthe highest Self together; since these three are declared by Scripture. When\ndifferent alternatives may be combined, on the ground of there being\n\np. 605\n\ndifferent effects in each case, it is improper to assume an option which\nimplies sublation of some of the alternatives. And in the present case such\ncombination is possible, the veins and the pericardium holding the position of\na mansion, as it were, and a couch within the mansion, while Brahman is the\npillow, as it were. Thus Brahman alone is the immediate resting-place of the\nsleeping soul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8. Hence the awaking from that](sbe48352.htm)\n\n"
