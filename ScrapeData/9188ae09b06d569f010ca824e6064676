On account of (the Self) standing in a supplementary relation (to action),\n(the statements as to\n\np. 286\n\nthe fruits of the knowledge of the Self) are arthavadas, as in other cases,\nthus _G_ aimini opines.\n\nAs the Self, in consequence of its being the agent, stands in a supplementary\nrelation to action, the knowledge of the Self also is connected with action\nthrough the mediation of its object, analogously to the case of the sprinkling\nof the rice-grains with water; hence as the purpose of the knowledge of the\nSelf is understood thereby, the statements of the text about the fruits of\nthat knowledge are mere arthavadas. Such is the opinion of the teacher _G_\naimini 1. The case is analogous to that of other textual statements as to the\nfruits of certain materials, sa _m_ skaras and works; which statements have\nlikewise to be understood as arthavadas. Cp. the passage, 'He whose\nsacrificial ladle is made of par _n_ a-wood hears no evil sound;' 'By\nanointing his eye he wards off the eye of the enemy;' 'By making the praya _g_\na and anuya _g_ a-oblations he makes an armour for the sacrifice, an armour\nfor the sacrificer so that he overcomes his enemies 2.'--But how can it be\nsupposed that\n\np. 287\n\nthe knowledge of the Self which the text does not exhibit under any special\nheading can enter into sacrificial action as a subordinate member, without the\npresence of any of the means of proof--general subject-matter and so on--which\ndetermine such subordinate relation?--The purvapakshin may reply that the\nknowledge of the Self enters into sacrificial action through the mediation of\nthe agent, on the ground of the means of proof called vakya (sentence;\nsyntactical unity) 1. But this we deny because in the present case 'sentence'\nhas no force to teach the application (of the knowledge of the Self to the\nsacrifices, as a subordinate member of the latter). Things which the text\nstates under no particular heading may indeed be connected with the sacrifice\non the ground of 'sentence,' through some intermediate link which is not of\ntoo wide an application 2; but the agent is an intermediate link of too wide\nan application, since it is common to all action whether worldly or based on.\nthe Veda. The agent cannot therefore be used as a mediating link to establish\nthe connexion of the knowledge of the Self with the sacrifice.--Your objection\nis not valid, the purvapakshin replies, since the knowledge of a Self\ndifferent from the body is of no use anywhere but in works based on the Veda.\nFor such knowledge is of no use in worldly works, in all of which the activity\nmay be shown to be guided by visible purposes; with reference to Vedic works,\non the other hand, whose fruits manifest themselves only after the death of\nthis body no activity would be possible\n\np. 288\n\nwere it not for the knowledge of a Self separate from the body, and such\nknowledge therefore has its uses there.--But, another objection is raised,\nfrom attributes given to the Self, such as 'free from sin,' and the like, it\nappears that the doctrine of the Upanishads refers to that Self which stands\noutside the sa _m_ sara and cannot therefore be subordinate to activity.--This\nobjection too is without force; for what the Upanishads teach as the object of\ncognition is just the transmigrating Self, which is clearly referred to in\nsuch terms as 'dear' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 5). Attributes such as being free\nfrom sin, on the other hand, may be viewed as aiming merely at the\nglorification of that Self.--But in more than one place Brahman, the cause of\nthe world, which is additional to the transmigrating Self and itself not\nsubject to transmigration has been established, and the Upanishads teach that\nthis very Brahman constitutes the real nature of the transmigrating Self!--\nTrue, that has been established; but in order to confirm that doctrine,\nobjections and their refutation are again set forth with reference to the\nquestion as to the fruit (of the knowledge of the Self).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[286:1](sbe38211.htm#fr_183) The contention of the purvapakshin-- _G_ aimini--\nis that the knowledge of the Self has no independent fruit of its own, because\nit stands in a subordinate relation to sacrificial action. This relation is\nmediated by the Self--the object of knowledge--which is the agent in all\naction, and therefore itself stands in a subordinate relation to action. By\nlearning that his Self will outlive the body the agent becomes qualified for\nactions, the fruit of which will only appear after death. The qualification\nthe Self thus acquires is analogous to that which the rice-grains acquire by\nbeing sprinkled with water; for only through this latter act of ceremonial\nmodification (or purification, sa _m_ skara) they become fit to be used in the\nsacrifice.--As the knowledge of the Self thus has no independent position, it\ncannot have an independent fruit of its own, and consequently the passages\nwhich state such fruits cannot be taken as 'injunctions of fruits,' but merely\nas arthavadas, making some additional statement about the fruit of the\nsacrificial actions to which the knowledge of the Self is auxiliary.\n\n[286:2](sbe38211.htm#fr_184) The material, i.e. the ladle made of par _n_\na-wood, is auxiliary to the sacrifice, and the fruit which the text ascribes\nto it (viz. hearing no evil sound) therefore has to be viewed as a fruit of p.\n287 the entire sacrifice. Analogously in the case of the sa _m_ skara--the\nanointing--which fits the sacrificer for performing the sacrifice, and in the\ncase of the praya _g_ as and anuya _g_ as which are merely subordinate members\nof the dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa.\n\n[287:1](sbe38211.htm#fr_185) The entire Veda constituting an extended\nsyntactical whole, in which the agent is the same.\n\n[287:2](sbe38211.htm#fr_186) Thus the quality of being made of par _n_ a-wood\nis connected with the sacrifices on the ground of the vakya implied in 'yasya\npar _n_ amayi guhur bhavati,' because here we have as an intermediate link the\n_g_ uhu, i.e. a special implement which is used at sacrifices only, and\ntherefore is not of too wide an application.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 3](sbe38212.htm)\n\n"
