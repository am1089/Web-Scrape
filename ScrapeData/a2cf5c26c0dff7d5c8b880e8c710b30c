The seasonal (bricks)\nare the same as these seasons: it is the seasons he thereby lays down. And,\nindeed, the seasonal ones are everything here, for the seasonal ones are the\nyear, and the year is everything here: he thus lays down everything here. And\ngenerative power they also are,--for the seasonal ones are the year, and the\nyear means generative power: it is generative power he thus lays down (or\nbestows on Agni and the Sacrificer).\n\n8:7:1:22\\. And, again, as to why he lays down seasonal (bricks),--the seasonal\n(ones) are the nobility and these other bricks are the peasantry: he thus\nplaces the nobility as the eater among the peasantry. He lays down (some of)\nthem in all the layers: he thus places the nobility as the eater among the\nwhole people 3.\n\n8:7:1:33\\. And, again, as to why he lays down seasonal (bricks),--this fire-\naltar is the year, and it is joined together by means of the seasonal\n(bricks): he thus makes the year continuous, and joins it together, by means\nof the seasons. These (formulas of the seasonal bricks) begin in a different\nway, but end in the same way; for the seasons were created, and, when created,\nthey were different.\n\n8:7:1:44\\. They spake, 'While being thus, we shall not be\n\np. 126\n\nable to procreate: let us unite with our forms!' They united in each single\nseason with their forms, whence there is in each single season the form of all\nthe seasons. As to their (formulas) beginning in a different way, it is\nbecause they were created different (or separately); and as to their ending in\nthe same way, it is because they united with their forms.\n\n8:7:1:55\\. He lays them down, with (Va _g_. S. XV, 57), 'Tapa and Tapasya, the\ntwo dewy seasons,'--these are the names of these two: it is thus by their\nnames that he lays them down. Tapa (the burner), doubtless, is yonder sun:\nfrom him these two seasons are not separated; and inasmuch as these two\nseasons are not separated from him, they are called Tapa and Tapasya.\n\n8:7:1:66\\. 'Agni's coupling-link thou art,'--this fire-altar is the year, and\nit is joined together by means of the seasonal (bricks): he thus makes the\nyear continuous, and joins it together by means of the seasons;--'May Heaven\nand earth fit into one another! may the waters and plants fit into each\nother!'--he thereby makes everything here 1 to fit in by means of the\nseasons:--'May the fires fit into one another, each singly, working\nharmoniously together for my supremacy!'--for these single bricks are the same\nas those fires: he thus says this so that they may fit in with each other for\nthe supremacy of those two seasons:--'whatever fires there are, at one with\neach other, within these two, Heaven and Earth;'--as the text is, so is its\nmeaning;--'let them draw\n\np. 127\n\ntogether, fitting in with the two dewy seasons, even as the gods draw together\nunto Indra;'--that is, 'even as the gods are drawing together round Indra, so\nmay they draw together for supremacy round these two seasons.' Two bricks\nthere are, because the season consists of two months. Only once he 'settles'\nthem: he thereby makes the season to be one.\n\n8:7:1:77\\. And as to why he now lays down these two;--this fire-altar is the\nyear, and the year is these worlds: the fifth layer of this (altar) is the\nsky, and the dewy season of this (year) is the sky; and when he now lays down\nthese two (bricks), he thereby restores to his (Agni's) body what these two\nare thereto: this is why he now lays down these two (bricks).\n\n8:7:1:88\\. And, again, as to why he now lays down these two;--this Agni (the\nfire-altar) is Pra _g_ apati (the lord of generation), and Pra _g_ apati is\nthe year: the fifth layer is his (Agni's) head, and the dewy season is its\n(the year's) head; and when he now lays down these two (bricks), he thereby\nrestores to his (or its) body what these two are thereto: this is why he now\nlays down these two (bricks).\n\n8:7:1:99\\. He lays down the two seasonal ones prior to the naturally-\nperforated one and to the Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis; for the last naturally-\nperforated one is the sky 1, and the last Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis 2 (all-light\nbrick) is\n\np. 128\n\nthe sun: he thus places the seasons on this side of the sky and the sun;\nwhence the seasons are on this side thereof. But generative power there also\nis (in these seasonal bricks) 1: he thus places generative power on this side\nof the sky and the sun; whence procreation takes place only on this side of\nthem, but stationary, indeed, is procreation beyond them, for just as many\ngods as there were of old, so many there are now.\n\n8:7:1:1010\\. Now, the (first) two seasonal (bricks) he lays down subsequently\nto the first naturally-perforated one, and to the first Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis;\nfor the first naturally-perforated one is this (earth), and the first Vi _s_\nva _g_ yotis is Agni: thereupon he places the seasons, whence the seasons are\nupwards from this (earth). But generative power there also is therein: he thus\nplaces generative power above this (earth); whence procreation only takes\nplace above (upon, not under) this (earth).\n\n8:7:1:1111\\. Let him not derange these (seasonal bricks) 2 lest he should\nderange the seasons, for deranged are\n\np. 129\n\nthe seasons for him who dies: hence, in whatever place he lays down the first\ntwo, there let him lay down all.\n\n8:7:1:1212\\. But the seasonal (bricks), indeed, are also these (three) worlds:\nby the (different) layers he thus builds up these worlds one above the other.\nAnd the seasonal (bricks), indeed, are also the nobility: by the (different)\nlayers he thus builds up the nobility above (the peasantry). And the seasonal\nones, indeed, are also the year: by the (different) layers he thus builds up\nthe year. Let him not thereafter place over them any other brick with a\nsacrificial formula, lest he should place the peasantry above the nobility.\n\n8:7:1:1313\\. Now these same (bricks) are indeed steppingstones, for by means\nof the seasonal (bricks) the gods then stepped over these worlds, hath from\nhence upwards and from above downwards: and in like manner does the Sacrificer\nnow, by means of the seasonal (bricks), step over these worlds, both from\nhence upwards and from above downwards.\n\n8:7:1:1414\\. Now, the _K_ arakadhvaryus lay down here yet other 'stepping-\nstones'; but let him not do so, for they do what is redundant, and these are\nindeed (all) the stepping-stones.\n\n8:7:1:1515\\. He then lays down a Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis (all-light brick);--the\nlast Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis, doubtless, is the sun, for in yonder (celestial)\nworld the sun, indeed, is 'all the light': it is the sun he thereby sets up.\n\n8:7:1:1616\\. And, again, as to why he lays down a Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis:--the Vi\n_s_ va _g_ yotis, doubtless, means progeny, for progeny indeed is all the\nlight:--he thus lays generative power into it (or into him, Agni and the\nSacrificer).\n\np. 130\n\n8:7:1:1717\\. He lays down the Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis prior to the naturally-\nperforated one;--for the last naturally-perforated one is the sky, and the\nlast Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis is the sun: he thus places the sun on this side\n(below) the sky, whence he burns only on this side thereof. But there also is\ngenerative power therein: he thus places generative power on this side of the\nsky, whence procreation takes place only on this side thereof.\n\n8:7:1:1818\\. Now the (first) Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis he lays down subsequent to\nthe first naturally-perforated one; for the first naturally-perforated one is\nthis (earth), and the first Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis is Agni: he thus sets up Agni\nupwards from this (earth), whence the fire blazes upwards from here. But there\nalso is generative power therein: he thus places generative power above this\n(earth), whence procreation only takes place above this (earth).\n\n8:7:1:1919\\. And the (second) Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis he lays down subsequent to\nthe second naturally-perforated one (in the third, or central) layer; for the\nsecond naturally-perforated one is the air, and the second Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis\nis Vayu (the wind): he thus places the wind in the air, whence that wind (has\nhis abode) in the air.\n\n8:7:1:2020\\. These (three) then are the lights;--and when he lays down these\n(three Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis bricks) in this way, he thereby sets up those same\nlights so as to face each other; and hence the fire blazes upwards from this\n(earth), and yonder sun shines downwards, and that wind blows sideways in the\nair.\n\n8:7:1:2121\\. [He 'settles' the Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 58],\n'May Paramesh _th_ in settle thee'--for Paramesh _th_ in saw this fifth\nlayer;--'on the back\n\np. 131\n\nof the sky, thee, the luminous one!'--for on the back of the sky is yonder\nluminous sun.\n\n8:7:1:2222\\. 'For all out-breathing, and off-breathing, and through-\nbreathing,'--for the Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis is the breath, and breath, indeed, is\n(necessary) for everything here;--'bestow thou all the light!'--that is,\n'bestow thou the whole (or every) light;'--'Surya is thine overlord,'--he\nthereby makes Surya (the sun) its overlord. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces\nthe Sudadohas on it: its (symbolical) meaning has been told 1.\n\n8:7:1:2323\\. Now, these (bricks) are indeed stepping-stones, for by means of\nthe Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis (bricks) the gods then stepped over these worlds, both\nfrom hence upwards, and from above downwards: and in like manner does the\nSacrificer now, by means of the Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis, step over these worlds,\nboth from hence upwards, and from above downwards.\n\n8:7:1:2424\\. Now, the _K_ arakadhvaryus lay down here yet other 'stepping-\nstones'; but let him not do so, for they do what is redundant, and these are\nindeed the stepping-stones.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[125:3](sbe4326.htm#fr_227) Or, he places the chieftaincy in every clan.\n\n[126:1](sbe4326.htm#fr_228) Or, all this universe.\n\n[127:1](sbe4326.htm#fr_229) For the symbolic meaning of the three svayam-at\n_ri_ _n_ _n_ as, as the central bricks of the first and third layers, and the\none lying on the centre of the fifth layer, see part iii, p. 155, note 8.\n\n[127:2](sbe4326.htm#fr_230) On the three Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis bricks, placed in\nthe same layers, as representing the gods Agni, Vayu and \xc3\x82ditya respectively,\nsee VI, 3, 3, 16; 5, 3, 3.\n\n[128:1](sbe4326.htm#fr_231) Or, But these (bricks) also are (or mean)\ngenerative power, cf. [paragraph 1](sbe4326.htm#8:7:1:1).\n\n[128:2](sbe4326.htm#fr_232) That is, he is not to shift them from their proper\nplace, but place each subsequent pair exactly on those laid down before. As a\nmatter of fact, however, these two bricks (if we determine their site by mere\ncalculation) would seem, in the fifth layer, to lie by half a foot further\naway from the central point, than the _Ri_ tavyas of the other layers do. This\nis owing to the fact that whilst, in the layers in which a Svayamat _ri_ _n_\n_n_ a lies in the middle, only one half of these central bricks lie on the\neast side of the central point, in the present layer the eastern -portion of\nthe Garhapatya (occupying the central part of the layer) consists of full-\nsized bricks. This discrepancy of half a foot was probably made good by some\nspace being left, which was afterwards filled up with earth; unless, indeed,\nthe Svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ as, as apparently natural stones, were allowed to\nsomewhat exceed the ordinary size of bricks.\n\n[131:1](sbe4326.htm#fr_233) For this verse see part iii, p. 307, note 2; for\nits symbolic meaning (as the breath, or vital air) VII, 1, 1, 15; 26.
