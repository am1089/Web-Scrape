He searched hither and thither through the forest, and\ncalled on every mountain and tree and on every bird and every beast, asking\nwhither she had gone. When he found a tattered garland which his loved one had\nworn, he swooned with overpowering grief.\n\nThen Lakshmana sprinkled water drops on his face until he revived. "Alas! my\nbrother," he cried, "do not sorrow thus lest death should snatch thee away."\n\nSaid Rama: "Sita is my heart\'s love. I cannot live without her. For my sake\nshe deserted the royal palace to wander in this fearsome jungle. Now that she\nis gone, the moments seem longer than years. . . . How can I live on when she\nis lost to me?"\n\nLakshmana comforted his brother: then they arose together and continued their\nvain search. . . . Rama\n\np. 409\n\nbeheld a beauteous lotus in a clear stream, and, blinded with tears, he deemed\nit was the face of Sita. "O hard-hearted one," he exclaimed, "art thou hiding\nthere among the water blooms? Seekest thou to test my love in this manner?\nArise and come to me, my sweet love, nor doubt me any longer."\n\nBut the bloom moved not, and Lakshmana led away his grief-distracted brother.\n\n"Mayhap she hath returned to the hut now," Rama cried. Then the brethren\nhastened to the hermitage, but found it empty as before. . . . Rama wailed in\nthe moon-light and cried to the orb of night: "O moon! mankind welcome thy\ncoolness, but thou dost bring to me naught but sorrow and tears. . . . Thou\nlookest over the whole world, beholding all living beings. Where, O tell me,\nwhere is my beloved one, my lost Sita?"\n\nRama wandered fitfully through the jungle: the moonbeams and the shadows\nfluttered around, and it seemed as if the face of Sita were peering from\neverywhere. So passed a sleepless night, full of mourning and illusions.\n\nOn the morrow the brethren went forth again in quest of the lost one. They\ncame to the place where Jatayus lay dying, and that lordly bird spake to Rama\nand related all that had befallen Sita and himself.\n\nRama sat on the ground: he embraced the dying Vulture King, and said unto\nLakshmana: "Alas! my brother, the noble Jatayus hath given up his life to\nserve me. I have lost my kingdom and my-sire; I have lost Sita, and now our\nally, the Rajah of Vultures, is dying. . . . All my friends are passing away.\nIf I were to sit in the shade of a tree, the tree would fall; if I stooped to\ndrink water from a river, verily the river would dry up." . . .\n\np. 410\n\nThen he spake to Jatayus, saying: "Whither hath Ravana gone with my well-\nbeloved?"\n\nSaid the Vulture: "He went southward towards an unknown forest fastness. . . .\nAlas! my strength fails, mine eyes grow blind, my life is ebbing from my\nbody."\n\nWhen he had spoken thus, Jatayus died in Rama\'s arms, and his soul ascended to\nthe heaven of Vishnu in a chariot of fire.\n\nThereafter the brethren went towards the south. On their way they met a black\ndemon of monstrous size; his head was in the middle of his body; he had but\none eye, and his teeth were numerous and long. Suddenly the misshapen demon\nstretched out his two great arms, and the brethren fought against the arms.\n\nThe demon cried: "Who are ye that dare to combat with me? I welcome ye because\nI am an hungered this day, and long to feast on human flesh."\n\nRama and Lakshmana fought on until they cleft both the great arms that were\ncoiled around them, whereat the monster fell upon the ground. Said Rama: "We\nare Dasaratha\'s sons, who are exiles in the jungle."\n\nThen the demon revealed that he was Kabandha, and bade them burn his body, so\nthat he might be bereft of his Rakshasa form and nature; thereafter, he\npromised, he would inform them regarding Sita. The brethren dug a pit and\ncremated the monster, and from the fire arose Kabandha, the Gandharva, who had\nbeen placed under spells. He spake and said: "Ravana dwells in the island of\nLanka; he is the King of Rakshasas. If thou wouldst fain overcome him, thou\nmust seek the aid of the ape chief, Sugriva, King of the Vanars, who dwells on\nRishyamukha mountain." 1\n\nWhen the brethren went towards this mountain,\n\np. 411\n\n[paragraph continues] Hanuman, son of Vayu, the wind god, a counsellor of the\nApe King, came forth to meet them. He conducted Rama and Lakshmana before\nSugriva, to whom they related the story of Sita\'s abduction.\n\nSaid Sugriva: "Some days past I beheld a woman who was borne aloft in the arms\nof a flying Rakshasa; she threw down her ornaments, which we have preserved\nwith care."\n\nThen the ornaments were brought forth, and they were recognized by Lakshmana,\nbut Rama wept so profusely that he knew not whether he gazed upon the jewels\nof Sita or not.\n\nSugriva, who was the son of Surya, the sun god, desired to aid Rama, but he\ntold that his bride and his kingdom had been taken from him by his half-\nbrother Bali, son of Indra, whom he feared. 1 Then Rama promised to slay Bali\nand restore the kingdom to Sugriva. And as he promised so did he do. Sugriva\nchallenged his brother to single combat, and Rama discharged an arrow which\npierced the heart of the usurper. All the apes rejoiced greatly when the\nrightful King of the Vanars was restored to his throne.\n\nThe rainy season came on soon afterwards, and Rama and Lakshmana went to dwell\nupon the mountain Malyavana, where they found a cave.\n\nSlowly passed the days of waiting. Ofttimes did Rama grieve for Sita. He was\nwont to speak to Lakshmana, saying: "Delightful is the season of rain and\ntempest unto those who dwell in happy homes in the midst of their families; it\nis a time of sorrow to those who suffer separation. . . . Behold the great\nblack clouds like to battling elephants leaping and rolling in heaven. Thunder\n\np. 412\n\nroars amidst the mountains. The lightnings flash and sparkle; alas! their\ngolden lustre in the darkness of night reminds me of my lost Sita. . . . Now\nthe wind falls and the earth is bright with rain tears, and I hear the sighing\nof Sita as she weeps in pain and sorrow. . . . The rainbow comes forth in\nbeauty like to Sita arrayed with jewels and ornaments. . . . Now the earth is\nrefreshed: trees are budding and flowers bloom again in beauty, but I cannot\nbe consoled. Lost is Sita, my dearly beloved; she writhes in the palace of the\nRakshasa king as the lightning writhes amidst the black clouds. . . . Ah! I\nabandoned my throne and kingdom with joy because Sita was with me; now my\nheart is breaking because she hath been snatched away. . . . See how the\nshadows gather again; winds roar and rains pour down; as dubious is my future,\nand dark as is this gloomy day of sorrow. Jatayus hath told that Sita is\nconcealed in a distant fastness. . . . How can I be consoled? I mourn not for\nmyself alone, but chiefly because she whom I love sorrows and suffers in a\nstrange land."\n\nNow, when Sita was dwelling in the palace of the demon king, guarded by\nRakshasa women, Ravana approached her again and again, and addressed to her\nsweet speeches, praising her beauty and endeavouring to win her love. But Sita\nrejected him with scorn. Although she was his prisoner, he could not win her\nby force. She was strengthened by her own virtue; she was protected by\nBrahma\'s dread decree. Be it known that once upon a time the lustful Ravana\nhad seized by force a nymph of Indra\'s heaven, whose name was Punjikashthala.\nWhen he committed that evil offence, Brahma spake angrily and said that\nRavana\'s head would be rent asunder if ever again he attempted to act in like\nmanner towards another female in heaven or upon earth.\n\np. 413\n\nSita said unto the demon king: "Thou shalt never have me for wife either in\nthis world or in the next. Rather would I die than gratify thy desire."\n\nAngry was Ravana, and he commanded the female Rakshasas to convey Sita to the\nAsoka grove, believing that her heart would be melted by the beauties of that\nfair retreat. "Thou wilt provide her with fine raiment," he said, "and with\nrich ornaments and delicious food, thou wilt praise me before her, and anon\nthreaten her with dire calamity if she refuseth to become my bride."\n\nSita remembered Rama in her heart by day and by night, and wept and moaned for\nhim, refusing to be comforted.\n\nWhen the rainy season was drawing to a close, Rama fretted because Sugriva,\nKing of the Vanars, was making no effort to collect his forces and prepare for\nthe recovery of Sita. Instead, he drank wine and spent the days in merriment\namong his wives. At length Lakshmana visited the palace and threatened Sugriva\nwith death, because he had broken his promise, whereat the monarch summoned\nspeedily his great armies of apes and bears in countless numbers. Four\ndivisions were then sent out to the north and the south, and eastward and\nwestward, to search for Sita.\n\nSuccess attended the efforts of the army commanded by Hanuman. It chanced that\nhis officers discovered on a mountain summit Sampati, the brother of Jatayus,\nKing of the Vultures. He was wounded and helpless, because his wings had been\nscorched by endeavouring to soar to the sun so that he might fulfil a vain\nboast. Although stricken thus, Sampati could still see clearly over vast\ndistances. He had beheld Ravana carrying away Sita across the ocean towards\nLanka. This knowledge he communicated through his son to Hanuman. When\n\np. 414\n\nhe rendered such great service to Rama his wings began to grow, and he was\nenabled once again to take flight athwart the blue heaven.\n\nHanuman then resolved to visit the distant island with purpose to discover\nwhere Sita had been hidden. Assuming gigantic form, he stood upon a mountain\ntop and leapt seaward. The mountain shook when he sprang from it. Over the sea\nwent the wind god\'s son and that swiftly. But demons endeavoured to arrest his\nprogress through the air. Surasa, mother of the Nagas, rose up with gaping\njaws, and cried: "Thou must needs pass through my mouth ere thou wilt go\nfarther, O Hanuman."\n\nThe heroic Ape extended his bulk, but the Naga hag opened wider and wider her\njaws to prevent him passing Then Hanuman shrank to the size of a man\'s thumb,\nand leapt into her mouth and out of it again and again so as to fulfil her\nconditions, whereat the hag owned that she was defeated and allowed him to\npass.\n\nNext arose the she dragon, Sinhika, who clutched the shadow of Hanuman and\nheld him back. Wrathfully she sprang forward to devour him, but again the\ncunning Ape contracted himself, and entering her mouth, attacked her and\nwounded her so that she was slain.\n\nLeaping from her body, Hanuman resumed his journey until he arrived at Lanka.\nNight had fallen but the moon shone brightly. He assumed the form of a cat and\ncrept stealthily through the capital, gazing on the wonders about him. He\nreached the great palace of Ravana and entered therein. It had shining crystal\nfloors and jewelled stairways of gold and silver. The mansion of Indra was not\nmore beautiful than that resplendent palace of the demon king. Hanuman crept\non through the women\'s chamber, and beheld fair forms "subdued in all the\nshapes of sleep"; beautiful were they as lotus\n\np. 415\n\nblooms that await the sun\'s first kiss ere they open their soft eyelids, or as\nthe lustrous stars on an autumn night gleaming and moving in heaven; it seemed\nas if a wreath of sweet human blossoms had been thrown carelessly into that\nperfumed chamber of sleep.\n\nHanuman wandered on until he reached the Asoka grove. There he beheld the\nlong-lost Sita, the queen of stars. Fierce she demons surrounded her, and some\nwere of fearsome shape; they had dogs\' heads and pigs\' heads and the faces of\nhorses and buffaloes; some were of great bulk and others were dwarfish; some\nhad but one eye and others had three eyes; the ears of some hung touching the\nground; others that were hairy were the most horrible to behold.\n\nWhen morning came Ravana drew nigh to plead his love, praising the beauty of\nSita, but she rejected him, as she had ofttimes done before, whereat the demon\ngrew angry and threatened her with dire tortures and even death. . . . Sita\nwas like to a gentle fawn surrounded by wolves. Yet she was without fear.\nRather would she perish than be unfaithful to Rama.\n\nHanuman kept watch, crouching in the branches of a tree, and at length he\nfound it possible to approach her in secret. At first she feared that Ravana\nhad assumed the form of Hanuman to deceive her, but she was re-assured when\nthe Vanar spy showed her the ring of Rama, and related how greatly he sorrowed\nbecause she had been taken from him. Then was her heart touched with sorrow\nmingled with joy. Hanuman offered to carry her away, but in her modesty she\nrefused to touch the body of any male being save Rama. She took from her hair\na bright jewel which she gave to Hanuman as a token; and she said that Ravana\nhad allowed her but two months to live if she refused to yield to him.\n\np. 416\n\nHanuman desired, ere he left the city of Ravana, to show his enmity against\nthe demons. Assuming his gigantic form, he uprooted trees and destroyed fair\nmansions. The guards came out against him and he slew many of them. But, at\nlength, the mighty Indrajit, son of Ravana, hastened forth and shot a magic\nserpent-shaft which enwrapped Hanuman like a noose, and rendered him helpless.\nThus was he taken prisoner, and he was dragged before Ravana, who commanded\nthat the Ape be put to death. But a counsellor intervened and advised that\nHanuman should be regarded as an envoy, and treated with dishonour ere he was\nsent back, so that their enemies might be terrified. Ravana consented to this\ncourse, and an oil-soaked cloth was tied round the Ape\'s great tail and set on\nfire. But Sita prayed that the fire should not injure Hanuman, and her prayer\nwas heard. The son of Vayu suddenly contracted his body so that his bonds fell\nfrom him, and he leapt over the city, setting fire with his flaming tail to\nmany mansions, and so accomplishing great destruction. Then he obtained\nanother brief interview with Sita, and once again leapt over the ocean; he\nhastened with the good tidings of his journey to Rama, who rejoiced greatly\nthat his loved one had been found.\n\nPreparations were at once begun to rescue Sita. The Vanar armies were marched\nsouthward, and they camped on the shore over against Lanka, which lies sixty\nmiles from the mainland. Here they were joined by a new and powerful ally.\n\nBe it known that the mighty deeds of Hanuman had stricken terror to the heart\nof Ravana. The demon king summoned a council of war to consider what should be\ndone. All his warriors advised him to wage war, except Bibhishana, his younger\nbrother, who censured the\n\np. 417\n\nmonarch for the offence which he had committed against blameless Rama. "Hear\nmy words," he said, "and restore Sita to her rightful lord, or else Rama will\nswoop down upon thy kingdom, O Ravana, as a falcon who seizeth his prey. Make\npeace with him now, lest many perish in battle."\n\nRavana was made angry, and cried: "Alas! for the love of my near relatives,\nwho sorrow at my fame and smile at my peril; they are ever jealous and full of\nguile, because they hate me in their secret hearts. . . . Evil is thy speech,\nO [Bibhishana](errata.htm#3). Depart from me, false prince, and carry thy\ntreason to our enemies. . . . If thou wert not my brother I would slay thee\neven now."\n\nBibhishana was thus banished from the Rakshasa kingdom, and he immediately\ncrossed the sea and joined the forces of Rama.\n\nRama performed sacrifices to propitiate the God of Ocean, so that the Vanar\nforces might he enabled to pass over to Lanka, but these proved to be\nunavailing. Then angrily he seized his bow and shot Celestial weapons into the\nbosom of the deep. The earth and the sea were immediately convulsed, and\ndarkness covered the heavens; lightning flashed and thunder bellowed aloud;\nthe mountains began to break in pieces. Rama next seized a fiery dart and\nthreatened to dry up the waters of the sea.\n\nAt that moment the King of Ocean rose serenely above the weltering billows in\nall his splendour, attended by shining water snakes. He addressed Rama with\ngreat reverence, reminding him that according to ancient laws he must remain\nunfordable, but counselling him the while to seek the aid of the Vanar chief\nNala, son of Vishwakarma, the divine artisan, so that a bridge might be\nconstructed to enable the armies to cross the deep. Then\n\np. 418\n\nthe King of Ocean vanished amidst the waves and the heavens brightened again.\n\nNala was immediately called upon to give his aid. Assisted by his workmen,\nthis wonderful Vanar, whose body was green, constructed a causeway of rocky\nislands between the mainland and Lanka (Ceylon), and to this day it is called\n"Rama\'s Bridge." 1\n\nRama meanwhile set up the Linga symbol of the god Shiva, and worshipped it on\nthat holy island which hath since been called Ramisseram.\n\nIn five days the strait was spanned. Then Rama mounted on the back of Hanuman,\nson of the wind god Vayu, and Lakshmana mounted the back of Angada, son of\nBali and grandson of Indra, and led the Vanar hosts across the sea. The apes\nand bears which composed the great attacking army leapt from island to island,\nshouting: "Victory to Rama!" "Victory to Lakshmana!" "Victory to Sugriva!" Now\nthe apes were of many colours; they were white and black, green and blue,\nyellow and red and brown. Sugriva shone like silver, Angada resembled a white\nlotus; Nila, son of Agni, was red, and Hanuman was yellow as pure gold;\nSarambha had also a yellow body, and Nala was green, while Darvindha had a\nblack body, a red face, and a yellow tail. These were all leaders and great\nwarriors of the Vanar host.\n\nThe army landed in Lanka unopposed, and encamped on a plain fronting the\ncapital of the Rakshasa king.\n\nThe Rakshasas issued forth speedily to attack the apes, and the blowing of\nhorns and beating of drums sounded like to the mighty thunder peals at a Yuga\nend. Indrajit was the Rakshasa leader. His followers rode on\n\np. 419\n\nelephants and lions, on camels and asses, on hogs and hyenas, and on wolves;\nthey were armed with bows and arrows, maces, spears, tridents, swords, and\nbeams, but some had also magic weapons. Roaring and swaying, they drove\nforward like to long sea-rollers assaulting the shore.\n\nThe gigantic apes wielded trees for clubs and threw great boulders, but some\ndepended on their sword-like nails and their long arrowy teeth. They rushed\nagainst the demons, shouting "Rama, Rama!" and soon the plain was covered by\nheaps of writhing bodies and severed limbs, while rivers of blood streamed\nacross it from between the battling hosts. Rama looked on without fear. He\nreposed his faith on the apes, for he knew that they were incarnations of the\ngods.\n\nThe apes were driven back until Sugriva flung a great tree, which shattered\nthe chariot of Indrajit. Then the Rakshasa leader and his army took flight.\n\nIndrajit obtained a new chariot by offering up in sacrifice a black goat, and\nreturning to the battlefield with his forces he shot arrows at Rama and\nLakshmana. Then he threw a serpent noose, which bound the two brothers so that\nthey were unable to move. Great was their peril, but Vayu, god of wind, sent\nto their aid the great Celestial bird Garuda, the serpent killer, and the\nsnakes which formed the noose fled from before it, whereat the brethren, who\nhad meantime fallen in a swoon, rose up again. Ravana then came forth, but\nRama shot arrows which swept the ten crowns from his ten heads, and he retired\nin his shame and skulked in the city.\n\nThe Rakshasas were in desperate straits and bethought them to awaken Kumbha-\nkarna, the mightiest of all the demons. In former days he had terrorized the\nUniverse; he continually devoured human beings, and had defeated\n\np. 420\n\n[paragraph continues] Indra even, but Brahma intervened and decreed that he\nwould sleep for six months and then awaken for one day only. Each time he\nawoke he devoured a great meal, after which he was again overpowered by\nslumber.\n\nThousands of men danced and shouted and blew trumpets beside the great\nsleeper, but he could not be wakened; elephants were driven over his body, yet\nhe never moved; then beautiful women came and caressed him, and he suddenly\nopened his eyes and roared like to the sea. His eyes were red with anger, and\nhe cried: "Why have I been awakened before my time?"\n\nThe Rakshasas informed Kumbha-karna of the army which surrounded the city, and\nthey brought him much food; greedily he swallowed swine and deer and many\nhuman beings and drank rivers of wine. Refreshed, but not yet satisfied, he\narose and said: "Where are the apes so that I may devour them?"\n\nHe mounted his chariot and went forth to battle. The apes trembled to behold\nhim and fled panic-stricken. . . . Sugriva rallied them quickly, and then they\nbegan to fling trees and boulders, but these were all splintered to pieces on\nthe limbs of the giant. He defeated Hanuman, and seized Sugriva and carried\nhim off in his chariot. Thousands of apes were devoured by the mighty\nRakshasa.\n\nAt length Kumbha-karna went against Rama and a fierce conflict ensued, but in\nthe end Rama discharged flaming arrows and severed his head from his body. The\nmonster staggered backward and fell into the ocean, and great billows arose\nand tossed angrily in the midst of the swollen deep.\n\nIndrajit thereafter offered up another sacrifice and secured fresh weapons.\nRendering himself invisible, he rose high in the air and showered arrows like\nrain until\n\np. 421\n\nRama and Lakshmana, who were grievously wounded, fell down and pretended to be\ndead.\n\nWhen darkness came on, Hanuman and Bibhishana surveyed the battlefield with\ntorches and found that many apes had been wounded and slain. Great was their\nsorrow, but Sushena, the ape physician, bade Hanuman to hasten to a certain\nHimalayan mountain to obtain healing herbs. The wind god\'s son assumed\ntremendous bulk, and, leaping aloft, went speedily through the air until he\nreached the place where the herbs grew. He searched for them in vain; then he\ntore up the mountain, and carrying it in his hand returned again to the\nbattlefield. The physician soon discovered the herbs; then he gave healing to\nRama and Lakshmana and the wounded apes, who rose up at once ready and eager\nto fight as before. Hanuman returned with the mountain and restored it to its\nplace.\n\nWhen the sun rose, Ravana sent forth young heroes to battle against the apes\nand bears, but they were all slain. Then Indrajit came to avenge the fallen,\nbut Lakshmana drew his bow and shot an arrow which Indra had given to him.\nUnerring was his aim, and Indrajit was struck down; his body rolled headless\nupon the plain.\n\nRavana lamented for the death of his son, crying: "He was the mightiest of my\nheroes and the dearest to my heart. All the gods feared him, yet by a mortal\nwas he laid low. . . . O my son, thy widow wails for thee and thy mother weeps\nin sore distress. Fondly I deemed that when the frailties of old age afflicted\nme thou wouldst close mine eyelids in death, but youth is taken first and I am\nleft alone to battle against mine enemies."\n\nFor a time the mighty demon wept; then he arose in wrath to wreak vengeance.\nFirst of all he hastened towards the Asoka grove to slay Sita. But the\nRakshasa\n\np. 422\n\ndames concealed the wife of Rama, and prevailed upon Ravana not to pollute his\nfame by slaying a woman. One cried to him: "Auspicious is the last day of the\nwaning moon. The hour of thy vengeance is nigh. Turn thee towards the\nbattlefield and great glory will be thine."\n\nRavana went gloomily away; he mounted his chariot to battle against his\nenemies, remembering those who had already fallen. Followed by a great army,\nhe swept from the city like to a tempest cloud which darkens the summer\nheaven. He beheld his brother Bibhishana fighting for Rama, and angrily cast\nat him a great weapon, but Lakshmana flung a javelin which shattered it in\nflight. Ravana smiled grimly and shouted to Lakshmana: "Slayer of my son, I\nwelcome thee! Thou hast protected Bibhishana; now protect, if thou canst,\nthine own self."\n\nHaving spoken thus he flung a great dart, which pierced the heart of Lakshmana\nand pinned him to the earth.\n\nRama stooped over the fallen hero and cried: "Alas! art thou fallen, my\ngallant brother? Thy weapons have dropped from thy hands; death claims thee,\nbut, O Lakshmana, thou wilt not die alone. I am weary of battle and of glory,\nand when my task is ended, I will follow in thy footsteps. . . . The love of\nwife or friend is easily won, but the love of a faithful brother, equal to\nthine, is rarely found in this world of illusions. .\n\nDearest of brothers, greatest of heroes, wilt thou never awaken from thy\ndeathly swoon or open again thine eyes to behold me? . . . Alas! the lips of\nLakshmana are silent and his ears are stopped."\n\nIn the darkness of night Hanuman again hastened northward in speedy flight to\nobtain the mountain which he had aforetime carried to Lanka. The physician\nfound\n\np. 423\n\nupon it the healing herbs; he pounded them and made a paste which he placed\nunder the nostrils of the unconscious warrior. Then Lakshmana rose up again\nhealed and hale and powerful. Rama rejoiced greatly, and turned against his\nfoes. . . . A night attack was made upon the Rakshasa capital, and the Apes\nintercepted a sacrifice which Ravana sought to offer up to the gods so as to\ncompel their aid; many fair mansions were given to the flames.\n\nWhen day came Ravana went forth to battle. Surpanakha, his sister who had\ncaused the war, stood in his way, and he thrust her aside impatiently, whereat\nshe cursed him, saying: "For this thou wilt never again return to the city."\n\nRavana drove on in battle fury, his heart filled with hatred for his foes and\nwith sorrow for the fallen. Rama went against him in the chariot of Indra, and\nfor a time a dubious conflict was waged. The earth trembled and the ocean\nshook with fear.\n\nSuddenly Rama darted forward. He drew his bow and shot a swift arrow, which\nsmote off one of Ravana\'s ten heads, but immediately another appeared in its\nplace. 1 Then the hero seized the flaming weapon which Brahma had created for\nthe protection of the gods; with unerring aim he discharged it in flaming\nsplendour; it struck the demon; it cleft in twain his heart of iron. Roaring\nin his fierce agony Ravana fell ponderously upon the plain and immediately\nexpired. So was the enemy of gods and men put to death by peerless Rama.\n\nCelestial music was heard in heaven and flowers fell upon the plain of\nvictory: a voice came down the wind, saying: " _O victor of truth and\nrighteousness, thy task is now ended_."\n\np. 424\n\nThe Rakshasa hosts broke in flight when Ravana fell, and Rama entered the city\nin triumph. Bibhishana burned the body of his fallen brother, and performed\nthe funeral rites. Thereafter he was proclaimed King of Lanka.\n\nWhen peace was restored, Rama commanded that Sita should be brought forth. She\nwas carried towards the plain concealed in a litter, and all the Apes gathered\nround to behold her, whereat Rama requested her to alight and walk towards\nhim, and she did so. With folded hands she approached her husband and knelt at\nhis feet, weeping tears of joy.\n\nClouded was the brow of Rama; he spoke sternly, and said: "Mine enemies are\nslain, and thou art delivered from captivity, O Sita; but now that my shame is\nremoved I have no desire to behold thee. I cannot receive thee as my wife,\nbecause that thou hast dwelt in the house of Ravana."\n\nSaid Sita: "Chaste and innocent have I remained. . . . O Rama, if thou hadst\ninformed me of thy doubt, I would have died ere now. Better is death than thy\ndark suspicion.\n\nAddressing Lakshmana, she then said: "Build for me a funeral pyre so that I\nmay end my grief amidst the. flames."\n\nAs she desired so did the brother of Rama do. He built the pyre and set it\nalight. Then Sita invoked Agni:\n\nIf in act and thought, she uttered, I am true unto my name,  \nWitness of our sins and virtues, may this fire protect my fame!\n\nIf a false and lying scandal brings a faithful woman shame,  \nWitness of our sins and virtues, may this fire protect my fame!\n\n\n\n[![THE CORONATION OF RAMA AND SITA](tn/42400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/42400.jpg)  \nTHE CORONATION OF RAMA AND SITA  \n\n\n\np. 425\n\nIf in lifelong loving duty I am free from sin and blame,  \nWitness of our sins and virtues, may this fire protect my fame!  \n                                              _R. C. Dutt\'s trans_.\n\nFearlessly she then leapt amidst the flames and vanished, while all lamented\naround her. Rama cried: "This day have I sinned, because she is innocent."\n\nIn that hour a great wonder was wrought. Suddenly the Deva-rishis and\nGandharvas and the gods appeared in the air. At the same time the red flames\nof the mighty pyre were divided, and the god Agni came forth with Sita, whom\nhe delivered to Rama, saying: " _Receive thy wife who is without sin or\nshame_."\n\nRama embraced Sita, and said: "I have never doubted her virtue; she is without\nsin, and now her purity has been proved before all men."\n\nHe wept, and Sita hid her face in his bosom and soft embrace.\n\nThe exile of Rama was now ended, and he returned speedily in the car of Indra\nto Ayodhya, with Sita and Lakshmana and Hanuman.\n\nBharata welcomed his elder brother, and laid the sandals at his feet, saying:\n"These are the symbols of thy rule, O Rama; I have guarded the throne for\nthee. Now take thy crown and govern thy kingdom. I give thee back thine own."\n\nRama was crowned on the morrow amidst the rejoicings of the people, and\nprosperity returned once again to the kingdom.\n\nTime went past, but the sorrows of Sita were not ended. The people whispered\nagainst the fair queen, doubting her virtue, because that she had been taken\naway by Ravana, and they wondered Rama had received her back. At length her\nhusband, yielding to the wishes\n\np. 426\n\nof his subjects, banished the innocent queen from the kingdom. The faithful\nLakshmana conducted her towards the southern jungles, and abandoned her nigh\nto the hermitage of Valmiki, counselling her with tears to take refuge with\nthe saintly poet.\n\nValmiki received her with pity, and soon afterwards she gave birth to two\nsons, who were named Lava and Kusa.\n\nSixteen years went past, and Rama\'s mind was troubled because that he had\nslain Ravana, who was the son of Pulastya, the Rishi. So he resolved to\nperform the Aswamedha (horse sacrifice) to cleanse his soul of sin.\n\nThe horse was sent forth to wander through the land, and when it approached\nthe hermitage of Valmiki, Lava and Kusa, the sons of Rama and Sita, took\npossession of it. They defeated the royal army and wounded Satrughna.\nLakshmana hastened forth with another army, but he was also grievously wounded\nand defeated by the young heroes. Then Rama himself went southward to wage war\nand recapture the horse. When his sons came forth against him, Rama wondered\nto find that they were so like to himself in countenance and bearing; his\nheart was filled with tenderness, and he asked them: "Whose children are you?"\n\nLava and Kusa greeted him with reverence, and said: "Sita is our mother, but\nwe know not the name of our sire."\n\nThen Rama perceived that the lads were his own sons. . . . Valmiki, the sage,\ncame towards him, and Rama said: "The people spoke evil things against Sita,\nand it was necessary to prove her innocence. Now let her be taken into my\npresence, for I know that these noble children are mine."\n\nValmiki returned to Sita and asked her to go with\n\np. 427\n\nhim before Rama, but for a time she refused to do so. The sage pleaded with\nher, and at length she walked forth from the hermitage with downcast eyes and\nhands uplifted. In the presence of Rama and the people she then invoked the\nEarth, and cried:\n\nIf unstained in thought and action I have lived from day of birth,  \nSpare a daughter\'s shame and anguish and receive her, Mother Earth!\n\nIf in duty and devotion I have laboured undefiled,  \nMother Earth! who bore this woman, once again receive thy child!\n\nIf in truth unto my husband I have proved a faithful wife,  \nMother Earth! relieve thy Sita from the burden of this life!  \n                                             _R. C. Dutt\'s trans_.\n\nWhen she had spoken thus, all who heard her wept and sorrowed. And while they\ngazed upon her with pity and tenderness, the earth suddenly yawned, and from\nits depths arose a golden throne sparkling with gems and supported by four\ngreat serpents, as a rose is supported by green leaves. Then the Earth Mother\nappeared and hailed Sita with loving words, and led her to the throne, on\nwhich she seated herself beside her sinless daughter, the faithful and\nundefiled wife of Rama. . . . The throne thereafter vanished and the earth\nclosed over it.\n\nSo passed Sita from before the eyes of all mankind. Rama flung himself upon\nthe ground in an agony of sorrow. But Brahma appeared and spake to him,\nsaying: "Why dost thou despair, O Lord of all? Well thou knowest that life is\nbut a dream, a bubble of water. . . ."\n\nRama, however, even after the Aswamedha had been performed, continued to mourn\nuntil the Celestial bird\n\np. 428\n\n[paragraph continues] Garuda carne for him: then he ascended to heaven, as\nVishnu, and found Sita, who was the goddess Lakshmi, the incomparable Sri.\n\nSo endeth the story of Rama, whose fame can never die.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[410:1](iml31.htm#fr_343) Among the Nilgiri mountains.\n\n[411:1](iml31.htm#fr_344) These apes are the incarnations of the Vedic deities\nwho sojourned on earth according to Vishnu\'s command.\n\n[418:1](iml31.htm#fr_345) Also "Adam\'s Bridge".
