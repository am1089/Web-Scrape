Her face was as fair and\ndelicate as the clear moonlight, and they called her Sodewa Bai  1 At her\nbirth her father and mother had sent for all the wise men in the kingdom to\ntell her fortune, and they predicted that she would grow up richer and more\nfortunate than any other lady--and so it was; for, from her earliest youth,\nshe was good and lovely, and whenever she opened her lips to speak, pearls and\nprecious stones fell upon the ground, and as she walked along they would\nscatter on either side of her path, insomuch that her father soon became the\nrichest Rajah in all that country--for his daughter could not go across the\nroom without shaking down jewels worth a dowry. Moreover, Sodewa Bai was born\nwith a golden necklace about her neck, concerning which also her parents\nconsulted astrologers, who said, 'This is no common child; the necklace of\ngold about her neck contains your daughter's soul; let it therefore be guarded\nwith the utmost care; for if it were taken off, and worn by another person,\nshe would die.' So the Ranee, her mother, caused it to be firmly fastened\nround the child's neck, and as soon as she was old enough to understand,\ninstructed her concerning its value, and bade her on no account ever allow it\nto be taken off.\n\nAt the time my story begins, this Princess was fourteen years old; but she was\nnot married, for her father and mother haf promised that she should not do so\nuntil it pleased herself; and although many great rajahs and nobles sought her\nhand, she constantly refused them all.\n\nNow Sodewa Bai's father, on one of her birthdays, gave her a lovely pair of\nslippers, made of gold and jewels. Each slipper was worth a hundred thousand\ngold mohurs  2 There were none like them in all the earth. Sodewa Bai prized\nthese slippers very much, and always wore them when she went out walking, to\nprotect her tender feet from the stones; but one day, as she was wandering\nwith her ladies upon the side of the mountain on which the palace was built,\nplaying, and picking the wild-flowers, her foot slipped and one of the golden\nslippers fell down, down, down the steep hill-slope, over rocks and stones,\ninto the jungle below. Sodewa Bai sent attendants to search for it, and the\nRajah caused criers to go throughout the town and proclaim that whoever\ndiscovered the Princess's slipper should receive a great reward; but though it\nwas hunted for far and near, high and low, it could not be found.\n\nIt chanced, however, that not very long after this, a young Prince, the eldest\nson of a Rajah who lived in the plains, was out hunting, and in the jungle he\npicked up the very little golden slipper which Sodewa Bai had lost, and which\nhad tumbled all the way from the mountain-side into the depths of the forest.\nHe took it home with him, and showed it to his mother, saying, 'What a fairy\nfoot must have worn this tiny slipper!'--'Ah, my boy,' she said, 'this must in\ntruth have belonged to a lovely Princess; (if she is but as beautiful as her\nslipper!) would that you could find such a one to be your wife!' Then they\nsent into all the towns of the kingdom, to inquire for the owner of the lost\nslipper; but she could not be found. At last, when many months had gone by, it\nhappened that news was brought by travellers to the Rajah's capital of how, in\na far-distant land, very high among the mountains, there lived a beautiful\nPrincess who had lost her slipper, and whose father had offered a great reward\nto whoever should restore it; and from the description they gave, all were\nassured it was the one that the Prince had found.\n\nThen his mother said to him, 'My son, it is certain that the slipper you found\nbelongs to none other than the great Mountain Rajah's daughter; therefore take\nit to his palace, and when he offers you the promised reward, say that you\nwish for neither silver nor gold, but ask him to give you his daughter in\nmarriage. Thus you may gain her for your wife.'\n\nThe Prlnce did as his mother advised; and when, after a long, long Journey, he\nreached the court of Sodewa Bai's father, he presented the Slipper to him,\nsaying, 'I have found your daughter's slipper, and, for restoring it, I claim\na great reward.'--' What will you have? said the Rajah. 'Shall I pay you in\nhorses? or in silver? or gold?'--' No,' answered the Prince, 'I will have none\nof these things. I am the son of a Rajah who lives in the plains, and I found\nthis slipper in the jungle where I was hunting, and have travelled for many\nweary days to bring it you; but the only payment I care for is the hand of\nyour beautiful daughter; if it pleases you, let me become your son-in-law.'\nThe Rajah replied, 'This only I cannot promise you; for I have vowed I will\nnot oblige my daughter to marry against her will. This matter depends upon her\nalone. If she is willing to be your wife, I also am willing; but it rests with\nher free choice.'\n\nNow it happened that Sodewa Bai had from her window seen the prince coming up\nto the palace gate, and when she heard his errand, she said to her father, 'I\nsaw that Prince, and I am willing to marry him.'\n\nSo they Were married with great pomp and splendour.\n\nWhen, however, all the other Rajahs, Sodewa Bai's suitors, heard of her\nchoice, they were much astonished, as well as vexed, and said, 'What can have\nmade Sodewa Bai take a fancy to that young Prince? He is not so wonderfully\nhandsome, and he is very poor. This is a most foolish marriage.' But they all\ncame to it, and were entertained at the palace, where the wedding festivities\nlasted many days.\n\nAfter Sodewa Bai and her husband had lived there for some little time, he one\nday said to his father-in-law, 'I have a great desire to see my own people\nagain, and to return to my own country. Let me take my wife home with me.' The\nRajah said, 'Very well I am willing that you should go. Take care of your\nwife; guard her as the apple of your eye; and be sure you never permit the\ngolden necklace to be taken from her neck and given to any one else, for in\nthat case she would die.' The Prince pro.mised; and he returned with Sodewa\nBai to his father's kingdom. At their departure the Rajah of the Mountain gave\nthem many elephants, horses, camels, and attendants, besides jewels\ninnumerable, and much money, and many rich hangings, robes, and carpets. The\nold Rajah and Ranee of the Plain were delighted to welcome home their son and\nhis beautiful bride; and there they might all have lived their lives long in\nuninterrupted peace and happiness, had it not been for one unfortunate\ncircumstance. Rowjee (for that was the Prince's name) had another wife, to\nwhom he had been married when a child, long before he found Sodewa Bai's\ngolden slipper; she, therefore, was the first Ranee, though Sodewa Bai was the\none he loved the best (for the first Ranee was of a sullen, morose, and\njealous disposition). His father, also, and his mother, preferred Sodewa Bai\nto their other daughter-in-law. The first Ranee could not bear to think of any\none being Ranee beside herself; and more especially of another, not only in\nthe same position, but better loved by all around than she; and therefore, in\nher wicked heart, she hated Sodewa Bai and longed for her destruction, though\noutwardly pretending to be very fond of her. The old Rajah and Ranee, knowing\nthe first Ranee's jealous and envious disposition, never liked Sodewa Bai to\nbe much with her; but as they had only a vague fear, and no certain ground for\nalarm, they could do no more than watch both carefully; and Sodewa Bai, who\nwas guileless and unsuspicious, would remonstrate with them when they warned\nher not to be so intimate with Rowjee Rajah's other wife, saying, 'I have no\nfear. I think she loves me as I love her. Why should we disagree? Are we not\nsisters?' One day, Rowjee Rajah was obliged to go on a journey to a distant\npart of his father's kingdom, and being unable to take Sodewa Bai with him, he\nleft her in his parents' charge, promising to return soon, and begging them to\nwatch over her, and to go every morning and see that she was well; which they\nagreed to do.\n\nA little while after their husband had gone, the first Ranee went to Sodewa\nBai's room and said to her, 'It is lonely for us both, now Rowjee is away; but\nyou must come often to see me, and I will come often to see you and talk to\nyou, and so we will amuse ourselves as well as we can.' To this Sodewa Bai\nagreed; and to amuse the first Ranee she took out all her jewels and pretty\nthings to show her. As they were looking over them, the first Ranee said, 'I\nnotice you always wear that row of golden beads round your neck. Why do you?\nHave you any reason for always wearing the same ones? '--' Oh yes,' answered\nSodewa Bai thoughtlessly. 'I was born with these beads round my neck, and the\nwise men told my father and mother that they contain my soul, and that if any\none else wore them I should die. So I always wear them. I have never once\ntaken them off.' When the first Ranee heard this news, she was very pleased;\nyet she feared to steal the beads herself, both because she was afraid she\nmight be found out, and because she did not like with her own hands to commit\nthe crime. So, returning to her house, she called her most confidential\nservant, a negress, whom she knew to be trustworthy, and said to her, 'Go this\nevening to Sodewa Bai's room, when she is asleep, and take from her neck the\nstring of golden beads, fasten them round your own neck, and return to me.\nThose beads contain her soul, and as soon as you put them on, she will cease\nto live.' The negress agreed to do as she was told; for she had long known\nthat her mistress hated Sodewa Bai, and desired nothing so much as her death.\nSo that night, going softly into the sleeping Ranee's room, she stole the\ngolden necklace, and, fastening it round her own neck, crept away without any\none knowing what was done; and when the negress put on the necklace, Sodewa\nBai's spirit fled.\n\nNext morning the old Rajah and Ranee went as usual to see their daughter-in-\nlaw, and knocked at the door of her room. No one answered. They knocked again,\nand again; still no reply. They then went in, and found her lying there, cold\nas marble, and quite dead, though she had seemed very well when they saw her\nonly the day before. They asked her attendants, who slept just outside her\ndoor, whether she had been ill that night, or if any one had gone into her\nroom? But they declared they had heard no sound, and were sure no one had been\nnear the place. In vain the Rajah and Ranee sent for the most learned doctors\nin the kingdom, to see if there was still any spark of life remaining; all\nsaid that the young Ranee was dead, beyond reach of hope or help.\n\nThen the Rajah and Ranee were very grieved, and mourned bitterly; and because\nthey desired that, if possible, Rowjee Rajah should see his wife once again,\ninstead of burying her under ground, they placed her beneath a canopy in a\nbeautiful tomb near a little tank, and would go daily to visit the place and\nlook at her. Then did a wonder take place, such as had never been known\nthroughout the land before! Sodewa Bai's body did not decay, nor the colour of\nher face change; and a month afterwards, when her husband returned home, she\nlooked as fair and lovely as on the night on which she died. There was a fresh\ncolour in her cheeks and on er lips; she seemed to be only asleep. When poor\nRowjee Rajah heard of her death, he was so broken-hearted they thought he also\nwould die. He cursed the evil fate that had deprived him of hearing her last\nwords, or bidding her farewell, if he could not save her life; and from\nmorning to evening he would go to her tomb and rend the air with his\npassionate lamentations, and looking through the grating to where she lay calm\nand still under the canopy, say, before he went away, 'I will take one last\nlook at that fair face. To-morrow Death may have set his seal upon it. O\nloveliness too bright for earth! O lost, lost wife!'\n\nThe Rajah and Ranee feared that he would die, or go mad, and they tried to\nprevent his going to the tomb; but all was of no avail; it seemed to be the\nonly thing he cared for in life.\n\nNow the negress who had stolen Sodewa Bai's necklace used to wear it all day\nlong, but late each night, on going to bed, she would take it off, and put it\nby till next morning, and whenever she took it off Sodewa Bai's spirit\nreturned to her again, and she lived till day dawned and the negress put on\nthe necklace, when she again died. But as the tomb was far from any houses,\nand the old Rajah and Ranee, and Rowjee Rajah, only went there by day, nobody\nfound this out. When Sodewa Bai first came to life in this way she felt very\nfrightened to find herself there all alone in the dark, and thought she was in\nprison; but afterwards she got more accustomed to it, and determined when\nmorning came to look about the place, and find her way back to the palace, and\nrecover the necklace she found she had lost (for it would have been dangerous\nto go at night through the jungles that surrounded the tomb, where she could\nhear the wild beasts roaring all night long); but morning never came, for\nwhenever the negress awoke and put on the golden beads Sodewa Bai died.\nHowever, each night, when the Ranee came to life, she would walk to the little\ntank by the tomb, and drink some of the cool water, and return; but food she\nhad none. Now no pearls or precious stones fell from her lips, because she had\nno one to talk to; but each time she walked down to the tank she scattered\njewels on either side of her path; and one day, when Rowjee Rajah went to the\ntomb, he noticed all these jewels, and thinking it very strange (though he\nnever dreamed that his wife could come to life), determined to watch and see\nwhence they came. But although he watched and waited long, he could not find\nout the cause, because all day Sodewa Bai lay still and dead, and only came to\nlife at night It was just at this time, two whole months after she had been\nburied, and the night after the very day that Rowjee Rajah had spent in\nwatching by the tomb, that Sodewa Bai had a little son; but directly after he\nwas born, day dawned, and the mother died. The little lonely baby began to\ncry, but no one was there to hear him; and, as it chanced, the Rajah did not\ngo to the tomb that day, for he thought, 'All yesterday I watched by the tomb\nand saw nothing; instead, therefore, of going to-day, I will wait till the\nevening, and then see again if I cannot find out how the jewels came there.'\n\nSo at night he went to the place. When he got there he heard a faint cry from\ninside the tomb; but what it was he knew not; perhaps it might be a Pen, or an\nevil spirit. As he was wondering, the door opened, and Sodewa Bai crossed the\ncourtyard to the tank with a child in her arms, and as she walked showers of\njewels fell on both sides of her path. Rowjee Rajah thought he must be in a\ndream; but when he saw the Ranee drink some water from the tank and return\ntowards the tomb, he sprang up and hurried after her. Sodewa Bai, hearing\nfootsteps follow her, was frightened, and running into the tomb, fastened the\ndoor. Then the Rajah knocked at it, saying, 'Let me in; let me in.' She\nanswered, 'Who are you? Are you a Rakshas, or a spirit?' (For she thought,\n'Perhaps this is some cruel creature who will kill me and the child.') 'No,\nno,' cried the Rajah, 'I am no Rakshas, but your husband. Let me in, Sodewa\nBai, if you are indeed alive.' No sooner did he name her name than Sodewa Bai\nknew his voice, and unbolted the door and let him in. Then, when he saw her\nsitting on the tomb with the baby on her lap, he fell down on his knees before\nher, saying, 'Tell me, little wife, that this is not a dream.'--'No,' she\nanswered, 'I am indeed alive, and this our child was born last night; but\nevery day I die; for while you were away some one stole my golden necklace.'\n\nThen for the first time Rowjee Rajah noticed that the beads were no longer\nround her neck. So he bade her fear nothing, for that he would assuredly\nrecover them and return; and going back to the palace, which he reached in the\nearly morning, he summoned before him the whole household.\n\nThen, upon the neck of the negress, servant to the first Ranee, he saw Sodewa\nBai's missing necklace, and seizing it, ordered his guards to take the woman\nto prison. The negress, frightened, confessed that all she had done was by the\nfirst Ranee's order, and how, at her command, she had stolen the necklace. And\nwhen the Rajah learnt this, he ordered that the first Ranee also should be\nimprisoned for life; and he and his father and mother all went together to the\ntomb, and placing the lost beads round Sodewa's Bai's neck, brought her and\nthe child back in triumph with them to the palace. Then, at news of how the\nyoung Ranee had been restored to life, there was great joy throughout all that\ncountry, and many days were spent in rejoicings in honour of that happy event;\nand for the rest of their lives the old Rajah and Ranee, and Rowjee Rajah and\nSodewa Bai, and all the family, lived in health and happiness.\n\n![](img/45.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd25.htm#fr_77) The Lady Good Fortune.\n\n[2](odd25.htm#fr_78) \xc2\xa3150,000.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXII.
