IV.\n\nKansa addresses his friends, announces their danger, and orders male children\nto be put to death.\n\nKANSA, much troubled in mind, summoned all his principal Asuras, Pralamba,\nKe\xc5\x9bin, and the rest, and said to them, "O valiant chiefs, Pralamba, Ke\xc5\x9bin,\nDhenuka, Putana, Arisht\xcc\x81a, and all the rest of you, hear my words. The vile\nand contemptible denizens of heaven are assiduously plotting against my life,\nfor they dread my prowess: but, heroes, I hold them of no account. What can\nthe impotent Indra, or the ascetic Hara, perform? or what can Hari accomplish,\nexcept the murder of his foes by fraud? What have we to fear from the \xc3\x81dityas,\nthe Vasus, the Agnis, or any others of the immortals, who have all been\nvanquished by my resistless arms? Have I not seen the king of the gods, when\nhe had ventured into the conflict, quickly retreat from the field, receiving\nmy shafts upon his back, not bravely upon his breast? When in resentment he\nwithheld the fertilizing showers from my kingdom, did not my arrows compel the\nclouds to part with their waters, as much as were required? Are not all the\nmonarchs of the earth in terror of my prowess, and subject to my orders, save\nonly Jarasandha my sire 1? Now, chiefs of the Daitya race, it is my\ndetermination to inflict still deeper degradation upon these evil-minded and\nunprincipled gods. Let therefore every man who is notorious for liberality (in\ngifts to gods and Brahmans), every man who is remarkable for his celebration\nof sacrifices, be put to death, that thus the gods shall be deprived of the\nmeans by which they subsist. T\xcc\x81he goddess who has been born as the infant\nchild of Devaki has announced to me that he is again alive who in a former\nbeing was my death. Let therefore active search be made for whatever young\nchildren there may be upon earth, and let every boy in whom there are signs of\nunusual vigour be slain without remorse."\n\nHaving issued these commands, Kansa retired into his palace, and liberated\nVasudeva and Devaki from their captivity. "It is in vain,"\n\np. 505\n\nsaid he to them, "that I have slain all your children, since after all he who\nis destined to kill me has escaped. It is of no use to regret the past. The\nchildren you may hereafter have may enjoy life unto its natural close; no one\nshall cut it short." Having thus conciliated them, Kansa, alarmed for himself,\nwithdrew into the interior apartments of his palace.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[504:1](vp121.htm#fr_1467) Jarasandha, prince of Magadha, was the father-in-\nlaw of Kansa.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter V](vp122.htm)\n\n'
