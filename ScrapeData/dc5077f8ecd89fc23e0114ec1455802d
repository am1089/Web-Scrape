Naraya _n_ a said :-- The best Sadhaka, then uttering after his meals,\nthe mantra \xc2\x93Amritapidhanamasi.\xc2\x94 (O Water-nectar! Let Thou be the covering to\nthe food that I have taken), should make \xc3\x82chaman (sip one Ga _nd_ u _s_ a\nwater) and distribute the remnant food (the leavings) to those who take the\nleavings. \xc2\x93Let the servants and maid-servants of our family that expect the\nleavings of food be satisfied with what leavings I give to them.\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Let those\ninhabitants of the Raurava hell or other unholy places who have remained there\nfor a Padma or Arbuda years and want to drink water, be satisfied with this\nwater that I offer to them and let this water bring unending happiness to\nthem.\xc2\x94 Repeating the above two mantras let the house-holder distribute the\nleavings of food to the servants and the water to those who want water\nrespectively. Then opening the knot of the Pavitra (a ring of Kus\xc2\x92a grass worn\non the fourth finger on certain religious occasions), let him throw this on\nthe square ma _nd_ alam or the ground. The Brahma _n_ a that throws this Kus\xc2\x92a\ngrass on the vessel (Patra) is said to defile the vow of Brahma _n_ as, taking\ntheir food. The Brahma _n_ a that has not yet washed his face after taking the\nfood, or touching another such Brahma _n_ a or a dog, or a S\xc2\x92udra, should fast\none day and then drink Pa\xc3\xb1chagabya and thus purify himself. And in case the\nUchchi _st_ a Brahmi _n_ (who has not washed his mouth and hands after meals)\nbe touched by another Brahmi _n_ , who is not Uchchi _st_ a, then simply\nbathing will purify him. By offering this Ekahuti (oblation once) according to\nrules mentioned above, one obtains the fruit of performing ten million\nsacrifices; and by offering this oblation five times one gets the\n\n\n\np. 1128\n\n\n\nendless fruit, of performing fifty million sacrifices, and if one feeds such a\nman who knows well how to do this Pranagnihoma, then he as well as he whom he\nfeeds both derive full benefits and they ultimately go to heaven. The Brahma\n_n_ a acquires while taking each of his mouthful of food the fruit of eating\nPa\xc3\xb1chagavya, who takes his food duly with the holy Pavitra Kus\xc2\x92a grass tied on\nhis finger. During the three times of worship, the devotee is to do his daily\nJapam, Tarpa _n_ am and Homa and he should feed the Brahmi _n_ s. Thus the\nfive limbed Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ a is completely done. The religious man should\nsleep on a low bedding (lie on the ground); he is to control his senses and\nanger; he is to eat moderately, the things that are light, sweet and good; he\nis to be humble, peaceful and calm. He is to bathe thrice daily and not to\nhold any unholy conversation with any woman, a S\xc2\x92udra, one who is fallen,\nwithout any initiation, and who is an atheist; as well he should not speak in\na language spoken by the cha _nd_ alas. One is to bow down before him who is\nin the act of performing the Japam, Homa and worship, etc; one is not to talk\nwith him. Never by deed, mind or word, on all occasions never speak about\nsexual intercourses; nor hold any contact with such people. For the\nrelinquishment of this subject is called Brahmacharyam (continence) of the\nkings as well as of the house-holders. But one should go to one\xc2\x92s legal wife\nduring the night time after her menstruation duly according to the rules of\nthe S\xc2\x92astras; the Brahmacharyam is not thereby destroyed. Man cannot repay the\nthree-fold debts and he cannot aspire for mok _s_ a without procreating sons\nor without doing the duties of the house-holders, as prescribed by the\nS\xc2\x92astras. An attempt to do so becomes entirely fruitless like the breast on\nthe neck of a goat. Rather it drags one downward. So the S\xc2\x92rutis say. So let\nyourself be free first from the debts due to the Devas, the debts due to the\nRi _s_ is and the debts due to the Pitris. Make sacrifices first and then be\nfree from the Devas\xc2\x92 debt. Hold Brahmacharyam and be free from the Ri _s_ is\xc2\x92\ndebt. Offer til and water; that is, do S\xc2\x92raddhas and tarpa _n_ ams and be free\nfrom the debt due to the Pitris. Then do readily practise your own Varnas\xc2\x92rama\nDharma.\n\n\n\n21-33. One is to practise Krichchra chandra yana Vrata and to take for his\nfood, milk, fruits, roots and vegetables, Habi _s_ yannam and food obtained by\nbegging so that one may become sinless. One is to make japam for Puras\xc2\x92chara\n_n_ am. One is to avoid salt, salty or alkaline substances, acid, garlic,\nturnips, eating in Kamsa vessels, chewing betels, eating twice, putting on\nimpure clothings, the intoxicating things and the unsastric nocturnal japam;\nalso one is not to waste one\xc2\x92s time over blaming and\n\n\n\np. 1129\n\n\n\ntrying to find faults with the relatives, playing at dice, or talking at\nrandom with one\xc2\x92s wife (so that evil effects may arise). One is to spend one\xc2\x92s\ntime in worshipping the Devas, reciting the hymns of praise, and studying the\nS\xc2\x92astras. One is to sleep on the ground, practise Brahmacharyam, and the vow\nof silence, bathe thrice, not practise anything which befits the S\xc2\x92udras only.\nOne is to worship everyday, make charities duly and be always happy, recite\nstotras daily, do occasional Deva worships, have faith in one\xc2\x92s Guru and Deva.\nThese twelve rules are to ensure success to the devotee who does Puras\xc2\x92chara\n_n_ am. One is to daily praise the Sun, with one\xc2\x92s face turned towards Him, do\njapam before Him; or one is to worship one\xc2\x92s own Deity in front of fire or the\nimage of any god, and do japam simultaneously. The devotee who practises\nPuras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am is to bathe, worship, do japam, meditate, practise Homa,\nTarpa _n_ am, is to have no desires and to surrender all fruits to one\xc2\x92s own\ndesired Deity, etc. These are necessarily to be observed by him. Therefore\nwhile doing japam, Homa, etc., the devotee\xc2\x92s mind is to remain always pleasant\nand satisfied. One should be ready to practise tapasya, to see the S\xc2\x92astras\nand be merciful to all the beings. As asceticism leads one to to heaven and to\nthe attainment of one\xc2\x92s desires, therefore know this that all the powers come\nto an ascetic. An ascetic can cause another\xc2\x92s death (maran); he can injure\nothers, cure diseases and kill all. Whatever the several Ri _s_ is wanted from\nthe Devi Gayatri and to that end made Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am and worshipped Her,\nthey obtained from Her all those things. O Narada! I will speak of S\xc2\x92anti\nKarmas etc., in a future chapter. Here I will speak of those rules, etc., that\nare to be observed in Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am in as much as they play the principal\npart to success.\n\n\n\nFirst of all shave yourself and have your hairs and nails, etc., cut off and\nbathe and be pure. Then perform the Prajapatya prayas\xc2\x92chitta for one\xc2\x92s peace\nand purification and next do the puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am of the Gayatri. Do not\nspeak the whole day and night. Keep your thoughts pure. If words are to be\nspoken, speak only what you take as true. First recite Mahavyarhiti and then\nthe Savitri mantra with Pra _n_ ava prefixed. Then recite the sin-destroying\nmantra \xc2\x93\xc3\x82pohi _st_ ha, etc.,\xc2\x94 and Svasti mati Sukta and \xc2\x93Pavamani Sukta.\xc2\x94 In\nevery action, in its beginning and at its end one is to understand the\nnecessity of doing the Japam, why and what for one is doing that.\n\n\n\nOne is to repeat the Pra _n_ ava, the three Vyarhitis and Savitri ayuta times\nor one thousand times or one hundred times or ten times. Then offer with\nwater, the peace offerings (tarpa _n_ am) to the \xc3\x82charya, Ri _s_ i, Chhandas,\nand the Devas. Being engaged in action, do not speak any impure language\n\n\n\np. 1130\n\n\n\nof the Mlechchhas or talk with any S\xc2\x92udra or any bad person. Do not talk with\nwife in the period of menstruation, with one who has fallen, with the low-\nclass person, with any hater of the Devas and the Brahma _n_ as, \xc3\x82charyas and\nGurus, with those who blame the fathers and mothers; nor show any disrespect\nto anybody. Thus I have spoken in due order about all the rules of Krichchhra\nvrata. Now I will speak of the rules of the Prajapatya Krichchhra, S\xc2\x92antapana,\nParaka Krichchhra and Chandraya _n_ a.\n\n\n\n34-54. One becomes freed of all the sins, if one performs the above five\nChandraya _n_ as. By the performance of the Tapta Krichchhra, all sins are\nburnt off in an instant. By the performance of the three Chandraya _n_ as the\npeople get purified and go to the Brahma Loka. By doing eight Chandraya _n_\nas, one sees face to face one\xc2\x92s Devata, ready to grant boons. With ten\nChandraya _n_ as, one gets the knowledge of the Vedas and one acquires all\nwhat one wants.\n\n\n\nIn the observance of the Krichchhra Prajapatya Vrata, one has to take food\nonce in midday for three days, once in the evening for three days, and for the\nnext three days whatever one gets without asking anything from anybody. For\nthe next three days one is not to take any thing at all and go on with one\xc2\x92s\nwork. These twelve days\xc2\x92 work constitutes the Prajapatya Vrata.\n\n\n\nNow about the rules of the S\xc2\x92antapana Vrata. On the preceding day one has got\nto eat food consisting of the mixture of cow urine, cow-dung milk, curd, ghee\nand the water of the Kus\xc2\x92a grass; the day following he is to fast. These two\ndays\xc2\x92 work constitutes the S\xc2\x92antapana Vrata.\n\n\n\nNow about the Ati Krichchhra vrata. For the first three days, one is to eat\none mouthful of food a day and for the next three days one is to fast. This is\nthe Ati Krichchhra vrata. This vrata repeated three times is called Maha\nS\xc2\x92antapana vrata. Note :-- According to the opinion of Yama, the fifteen days\xc2\x92\nwork constitutes Maha S\xc2\x92antapana. For the three days one has to eat cow-urine;\nfor the next three days, cow-dung, for the next three days, curd; for the next\nthree days milk; and for the next three days one has to take ghee. Then one\nbecomes pure. This is called the all sin-destroying Maha S\xc2\x92antapan Vrata. Now\nI am speaking of the nature of the Tapta Krichchhra Vrata.\n\n\n\nThe Tapta Krichchhra vrata is carried out for the twelve days. For the first\nthree days, one has to drink hot water; for the next three days, hot milk; for\nthe next three days, the hot ghee and for the next three days, air only.\nEveryday one has to bathe once only under the above rules,\n\n\n\np. 1131\n\n\n\nand remain self-controlled. If one drinks water simply everyday under the\nabove conditions, that is called the Prajapatya vrata.\n\n\n\nTo remain without any food for twelve days according to rules is called the\nParaka Krichchhra vrata. By this vrata, all sins are destroyed.\n\n\n\nNow about the rules of taking food in the Chandraya _n_ a vrata. In the dark\nfortnight one will have to decrease one mouthful of food every day and in the\nbright fortnight one will have to increase one mouthful every day and one has\nto fast completely on the Amavasya (new moon) day. One has to bathe thrice\ndaily during every Sandhya time. This is known as the Chandraya _n_ a Vrata.\n\n\n\nIn the S\xc2\x92is\xc2\x92u Chandraya _n_ a Vrata one will have to take four mouthfuls of\nfood in the midday and four mouthfuls in the evening. In the Yati Chandraya\n_n_ a one has to take eight mouthfuls in the midday and to control his\npassions.\n\n\n\n55\\. These abovementioned vratas are observed by the Rudras, \xc3\x82dityas, Vasus,\nand Maruts; and they are enjoying thereby their full safety.\n\n\n\nEach of the above vratas purifies the seven Dhatus of the body in seven nights\nsimply! First skin, then blood, then flesh, bones, sinews, marrows and semen\nare purified. There is no doubt in this. Thus purifying the \xc3\x82tman by the above\nvratas, one is to do religious actions. The work done by such a purified man\nis sure to be met with success. First control the senses, be pure and do good\nactions. Then all your desires will be undoubtedly fructified. Fast for three\nnights, without doing any actions and see the result. (You will not do\nanything and you want self control! Is this a child\xc2\x92s play?) Perform for three\ndays the nocturnal vratas. Then proceed with your desired duties. If one works\naccording to these methods, one gets the fruits of Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am. O\nNarada! By the Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am of S\xc2\x92ri Gayatri Devi all desires are\nfulfilled and all sins are destroyed. Before doing Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am purify\nyour body by performing the above vratas. Then you will get all your desires\ncompletely fulfilled. O Narada! Thus I have spoken to you of the secret rules\nof Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am. Never disclose this to any other body. For it is\nrecognised equivalent to the Vedas.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-third Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the Tapta\nKrichchhra vrata and others in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam\nof 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 24](bk11ch24.htm)\n\n'
