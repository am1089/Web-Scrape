Who are these resplendent men, dwelling together, the boys of Rudra, also\n[1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:1:1) with good horses?\n\n2\\. No one indeed knows their births, they alone know each other's birthplace.\n\n3\\. They plucked each other with their beaks [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:3:1); the\nhawks, rushing like the wind, strove together.\n\n4\\. A wise man understands these secrets [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:4:1), that P\n_ri_ _s_ ni, the great, bore an udder.\n\n5\\. May that clan be rich in heroes by the Maruts, always victorious, rich in\nmanhood!\n\n6\\. They are quickest to go, most splendid with splendour, endowed with\nbeauty, strong with strength.\n\n7\\. Strong is your strength, steadfast your powers, and thus by the Maruts is\nthis clan mighty.\n\n8\\. Resplendent is your breath, furious are the minds of the wild host, like a\nshouting maniac [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:8:1).\n\n9\\. Keep from us entirely your flame, let not your hatred reach us here.\n\n10\\. I call on the dear names of your swift ones, so that the greedy should be\nsatisfied [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:10:1), O Maruts,\n\n11\\. The well-armed, the swift, decked with beautiful chains, who themselves\nadorn their bodies.\n\n12\\. Bright are the libations for you, the bright ones, O Maruts, a bright\nsacrifice I prepare for the bright. In proper order came those who truly\nfollow the order, the bright born, the bright, the pure.\n\n13\\. On your shoulders, O Maruts, are the rings,\n\np. 374\n\non your chests the golden chains are fastened; far-shining like lightnings\nwith showers [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:13:1), you wield your weapons, according\nto your wont.\n\n14\\. Your hidden [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:14:1) splendours come forth; spread\nout your powers (names), O racers! Accept, O Maruts, this thousandfold,\ndomestic share, as an offering for the house-gods\n[2](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:14:2).\n\n15\\. If you thus listen, O Maruts, to this praise, at the invocation of the\npowerful sage, give him quickly a share of wealth in plentiful offspring,\nwhich no selfish enemy shall be able to hurt.\n\n16\\. The Maruts, who are fleet like racers, the manly youths, shone like\nYakshas [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:16:1); they are beautiful like boys standing\nround the hearth, they play about like calves who are still sucking.\n\n17\\. May the bounteous Maruts be gracious to us, opening up to us the firm\nheaven and earth. May that bolt of yours which kills cattle and men, be far\nfrom us! Incline to us, O Vasus, with your favours.\n\n18\\. The Hot _ri_ priest calls on you again and again, sitting down and\npraising your common gift, O Maruts. O strong ones, he who is the guardian of\nso much wealth, he calls on you with praises, free from guile.\n\n19\\. These Maruts stop the swift, they bend strength by strength\n[1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:19:1), they ward off the curse of the plotter, and\nturn [2](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:19:2) their heavy hatred on the enemy.\n\n20\\. These Maruts stir up even the sluggard [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:20:1),\neven the vagrant [2](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:20:2), as the gods\n[3](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:20:3) pleased. O strong ones, drive away the darkness,\nand grant us all our kith and kin.\n\n21\\. May we not fall away from your bounty, O\n\np. 375\n\n[paragraph continues] Maruts, may we not stay behind, O charioteers, in the\ndistribution of your gifts. Let us share in the brilliant wealth, the well-\nacquired, that belongs to you, O strong ones.\n\n22\\. When valiant men fiercely fight together, for rivers, plants, and houses\n[1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:22:1), then, O Maruts, sons of Rudra, be in battles\nour protectors from the enemy.\n\n23\\. O Maruts, you have valued [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:23:1) the praises which\nour fathers have formerly recited to you; with the Maruts the victor is\nterrible in battle, with the Maruts alone the racer wins the prize.\n\n24\\. O Maruts, may we have a strong son, who is lord among men, a ruler,\nthrough whom we may cross the waters to dwell in safety, and then obtain our\nown home for you [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:24:1).\n\n25\\. May Indra then, Varu _n_ a, Mitra, Agni, the waters, the plants, the\ntrees of the forest be pleased with us. Let us be in the keeping, in the lap\nof the Maruts; protect us always with your favours.\n\np. 376\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Vasish _th_ a. Verse 1 occurs in SV. I, 433 verse 10 in TS. II, 1,\n11, 1; MS. IV, 11, 2; verse 12 in TB. II, 8, 5, 5; MS. IV, 14, 18; verse 13 in\nTB. II, 8, 5, 5; MS. IV, 14, 18; verse 14 in TS. IV, 3, 13, 6; MS. IV, 10, 5;\nverse 16 in TS. IV, 3, 13, 7; MS. IV, 10, 5; verse 19 in TB. II, 8, 5, 6; MS.\nIV, 14, 18. Metre, 1-11 Dvipada Vira _g_ ; 12-25 Trish _t_ ubh.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The SV. reads atha for the older adha. Sanika in the edition of the\nBibl. Ind. is a misprint for sani _l_ a.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Sva-pu is explained by Roth as possibly a broom, raising the dust.\nGrassmann translates it by light, Ludwig by blowing. I suggest to take it for\n*vapu, in the sense of beak or claw, from vap, which follows immediately. See\nnote to I, 88, 4. I do not see how the other meanings assigned to svapu give\nany sense. Oldenberg therefore suggests pavanta, 'Sie stromten hell auf\neinander zu mit ihren svapus.'\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Saya _n_ a explains eta\xc2\xb4ni ni _n_ ya\xc2\xb4 by _s_ vetavar _n_ ani\nmarudatmakani bhutani. He takes udhas as a locative.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Geldner translates: 'Der Spielmann des wilden Heeres ist wie ein\nMuni,' and adds, 'Aber was ist ein Muni im Veda?'\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. I read t _ri_ pan for t _ri_ pat of the Pada text, and refer vava _s_\nana\xc2\xb4 _h_ to the Maruts. The TS. has t _ri_ pat, and the commentary explains it\nby t _ri_ ptim. The first line is Vira _g_ , the second Trish _t_ ubh, and the\nTrish _t_ ubh metre is afterwards carried on.\n\np. 377\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nThis verse refers to the Maruts, not, as Ludwig thinks, to the priests. Dr. v.\nBradke (Dyaus Asura, p. 65) proposes to join verses 10 and 11 into one Trish\n_t_ ubh, and possibly to insert a\xc2\xb4 before huve. I doubt whether for the\npresent such changes are justified. On the structure of this hymn, see\nOldenberg, Prol. 96, Anm. 3; 200, Anm. 5.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. TB. II, 8, 5, 6, reads vy _ri_ sh _t_ ibhi _h_ (not vrish _t_ ibhi _h_\n), and the commentator explains, vyrish _t_ ibhir ayudhavi _s_ eshair vyrish\n_t_ yakhyair, vi _s_ eshe _n_ a ro _k_ amana _h_ sthita _h_. And again, _ri_\nsh _t_ aya eva vi _s_ ish _t_ atvad vy _ri_ sh _t_ aya ity u _k_ yante.\nBollensen, Z. D. M. G. XLI, 501, conjectures _ri_ sh _t_ ibhi _h_ for vrish\n_t_ ibhi _h_ , which is very ingenious. See also note 1 to II, 34, 2.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. Budhnya\xcc\x83, explained by budhne bhavani, and also by kalaprav _ri_\nttani.\n\nNote 2. G _ri_ hamedhiya may refer to the Maruts as g _ri_ hamedhas or g _ri_\nhamedhinas; see RV. VII, 59, 10; VS. XXIV, 16. The g _ri_ hamedhiya ish _t_ i\nin _S_ at. Br. XI, 5, 2, 4, is meant for the Maruts.\n\n##### Verse 16.\n\nNote 1. Yakshad _r i_ _s_ a _h_ is explained as wishing to see a sacrifice or\nfeast. Ludwig retains this meaning. Grassmann translates, 'wie feurige Blitze\nfunkeln.' Yaksha may mean a shooting star or any meteor, literally what shoots\nor hastens along; see VII, 61, 5. na ya\xc2\xb4su _k_ itram dad _ri_ _s_ e na\nyaksham; also note to V, 55, 1. But d _ri_ _s_ is not sad _ri_ _s_. If we\nfollow the later Sanskrit, yaksha would mean a class of spirits, followers of\nKuvera, also ghosts in general. If this is not too modern a conception for the\nRig-veda, we might translate yakshad _ri_ _s_ , 'appearing as ghosts' (see Kau\n_s_. Sutra 95 in BR.), or, considering the expression atya _h_ na ya _m_ sat\nyakshabh _r i_t vi _k_ eta _h_ , I, 190, 4, take it for a name of horses.\n\np. 378\n\n##### Verse 19.\n\nNote 1. Does not sahasa a\xc2\xb4 stand for sahasa a\xc2\xb4, and not for sahasa _h_ a\xc2\xb4?\nComp. Oldenberg, Prolegomena, 465 seq.\n\nNote 2. On dadhanti, see Hubschmann, Indogerm. Vocal-system, p. 12.\n\n##### Verse 20.\n\nNote 1. On radhra, see Pischel, Ved. Stud. pp. 124 seq.\n\nNote 2. Bh _ri_ mi is doubtful, but as it stands by the side of radhra, it\nseems to have a bad meaning, such as a vagrant, unsteady.\n\nNote 3. The Vasus are often mentioned with the \xc3\x82dityas and Rudras, see III, 8,\n8; X, 66, 12; 128, 9. By themselves they became almost synonymous with the\nDevas. Thus in VII, ii, 4, we read that Agni became the master of all\nsacrifices, kratum hi asya Vasava _h_ _g_ ushanta atha deva\xc2\xb4 _h_ dadhire\nhavyava\xc2\xb4ham, 'for the Vasus liked his wisdom, therefore the Devas made him the\ncarrier of offerings.' See also V, 3, 10. pita\xc2\xb4 Vaso yadi tat _g_ oshayase. In\none passage, VI, 50, 4, Vasava _h_ means the Maruts. In our passage it seems\nbetter to take it in the sense of gods, but we might also refer it to the\nMaruts.\n\n##### Verse 22.\n\nNote 1. With pada b, compare VII, 70, 3 b.\n\n##### Verse 23.\n\nNote 1. I have taken bhu\xc2\xb4ri _k_ akra in the sense of magni facere, though I\ncan find no analogous passages.\n\n##### Verse 24.\n\nNote 1. This verse has been well explained by Dr. v. Bradke, Dyaus Asura, p.\n66. Svam oka _h_ , our own home, occurs IV, 50, 8; V, 33, 4; VI, 41, 1; VIII,\n72, 14. Abhyas means generally to obtain what is not our own. See also VII,\n48, 2. Va _h_ , which I have translated 'for you,' may also mean 'from you.'\n\n##### Verse 25.\n\nThis verse is marked as a galita taken from VII, 34, 25, while the last pada\nis a galita taken from VII, I, 25.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 57.
