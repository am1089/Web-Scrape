And on account of the existence of that which is posterior.\n\np. 465\n\nOn account of the existence of the posterior, i.e. the effect existing in the\ncause--for this reason also the effect is non-different from the cause. For in\nordinary language as well as in the Veda the effect is spoken of in terms of\nthe cause; as when we say, \'all these things--jars, platters, &c.--were clay\nonly this morning\'; or when the Veda says, \'Being only was this in the\nbeginning.\'\n\n18\\. If it be said \'not, on account of the designation of the (effect as the)\nnon-existent; we reply, not so, on account (of such designation being due to)\nanother attribute, (as appears) from the complementary passage, from\nReasoning, and from another Vedic text.\n\nThe assertion that ordinary speech as well as the Veda acknowledges the\nexistence of the effect in the cause cannot be upheld \'on account of the\ndesignation of (the effect as) the non-existent.\' For the Veda says, \'Non-\nbeing only was this in the beginning\' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 19, 1); \'Non-being\nindeed was this in the beginning\' (Taitt. Up. II, 6. 1); \'In the beginning\ntruly this was not anything whatever.\' And in ordinary language we say \'In the\nmorning all this--jars, platters, and so on,--was not.\'--This objection the\nSutra proceeds to refute. \'Not so, on account of such designation being due to\nanother attribute.\' The designation of the effected substance as the non-\nexistent is due to the effect having at an earlier time a different quality,\ni.e. a different constitution; not to its being, as you think, absolutely non-\nexisting. The quality different from the quality of existence is non-\nexistence; that is to say, of the world designated as _this_ , the quality of\nexistence is constituted by name and form, while the quality of non-existence\nconsists in the subtle state opposed to name and form.--But how is this\nknown?--\'From the complementary passage, from Reasoning, and from another\ntext.\' The complementary passage is the one following on the last text quoted\nabove, viz. \'that Non-existent formed the resolve "may I be". The resolve\nreferred to in this complementary text serving as\n\np. 466\n\nan inferential sign to determine that the Non-existence spoken of is other\nthan absolute Non-existence, we, on the basis of the observation that all the\nthree texts quoted treat of the same matter, conclude that in the other two\ntexts also the Non-existent has to be understood in the same sense. \'From\nReasoning.\' Reasoning shows Being and Non-being to be attributes of things.\nThe possession, on the part of clay, of a certain shape, a broad base, a\nbelly-shaped body, and so on, is the cause of our thinking and saying \'the jar\nexists,\' while the connexion, on the part of the clay, with a condition\nopposed to that of a jar is the cause of our thinking and saying \'the jar does\nnot exist.\' A condition of the latter kind is e. g.--the clay\'s existing in\nthe form of two separate halves of a jar, and it is just this and similar\nconditions of the clay which account for our saying that the jar does not\nexist. We do not perceive any non-existence of the jar different from the kind\nof non-existence described; and as the latter sufficiently accounts for all\ncurrent ideas and expressions as to non-existence, there is no occasion to\nassume an additional kind of non-existence.--And also \'from another text.\' The\ntext meant is that often quoted, \'Being only was this in the beginning.\' For\nthere the view of the absolute non-being of the effect is objected to, \'But\nhow could it be thus?\' &c., and then the decision is given that from the\nbeginning the world was \'being.\' This matter is clearly set forth in the text\n\'This was then undistinguished; it became distinguished by name and form\' (B\n_ri_. Up. I, 4, 7).\n\nThe next two Sutras confirm the doctrine of the non-difference of the effect\nfrom the cause by two illustrative instances.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 19.
