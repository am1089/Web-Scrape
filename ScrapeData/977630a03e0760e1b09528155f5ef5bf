He maintains silence; and silently he remains seated till sunset.\nThe reason why he maintains silence is this:\n\n3:2:2:22\\. By means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority\nwhich they now wield. They spake, \'How can this (world) of ours be made\nunattainable to men?\' They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, even as bees would\nsuck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of\nthe sacrificial post, they disappeared: and because they scattered (yopaya,\nviz. the sacrifice) therewith, therefore it is called yupa (post) 1.\n\n3:2:2:33\\. Now this was heard by the _Ri_ shis. They collected the sacrifice.\nAs that sacrifice was collected (prepared) 2, so does he who is consecrated\ncollect the sacrifice (by keeping his speech within him),--for the sacrifice\nis speech.\n\np. 37\n\n3:2:2:44\\. When the sun has set, he breaks silence. Now Pra _g_ apati is the\nyear, since the sacrifice is Pra _g_ apati; and the year is day and night,\nsince these two revolving produce it. He has been consecrated during the day,\nand he has gained the night: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is its\nextent, to that extent has he gained it before he breaks silence.\n\n3:2:2:55\\. Some, however, make him break his silence on seeing the (first)\nstart 1, arguing that then the sun has actually set. But let him not do so,\nfor what would become of them if it were cloudy? Let him therefore break\nsilence as soon as he thinks the sun has set.\n\n3:2:2:66\\. Now, some make him break silence by the formula, \'Earth! ether!\nsky!\' arguing that thereby they strengthen the sacrifice, they heal, the\nsacrifice. But let him not do so; for he who breaks silence with that\n(formula) does not strengthen the sacrifice, does not heal the sacrifice.\n\n3:2:2:77\\. Let him rather break silence with this one (Va _g_. S. IV, 11),\n\'Prepare ye the fast-food! prepare ye the fast-food! [prepare ye the fast-\nfood!] Agni is the Brahman, Agni is the sacrifice; the tree is meet for the\nsacrifice.\' For this indeed is his sacrifice, this is his havis-offering at\nthis (rite of consecration), even as the Agnihotra was heretofore 2. In thus\npreparing the (Soma) sacrifice by means of the sacrifice, he establishes the\nsacrifice\n\np. 38\n\nin the sacrifice, and carries on the sacrifice by means of the sacrifice; for\n(the partaking of) that fast-food is indeed carried on by him till the\npressing of the Soma. Thrice he pronounces (the first words 1), for threefold\nis the sacrifice.\n\n3:2:2:88\\. Moreover, he breaks silence, after turning round towards the fire.\nHe, on the other hand, who breaks silence with any other (formula) but this 2,\ndoes not strengthen the sacrifice, does not heal the sacrifice. In pronouncing\nthe first (part of the formula) 3 he utters the truth of speech 4.\n\n3:2:2:99\\. \'Agni is the Brahman\' (neut.), he says, for Agni is indeed the\nBrahman (sacerdotium);--\'Agni is the sacrifice,\' for Agni is indeed the\nsacrifice;--\'the tree is meet for the sacrifice,\' for trees 5 are indeed meet\nfor the sacrifice, since men could not sacrifice, if there were no trees:\ntherefore he says, \'the tree is meet for the sacrifice.\'\n\n3:2:2:1010\\. Thereupon they cook the fast-food for him. For he who is\nconsecrated draws nigh to the gods and becomes one of the deities. But the\nsacrificial food of the gods must be cooked, and not uncooked: hence they cook\nit, and he partakes of that fast-milk\n\np. 39\n\n[paragraph continues] (vrata) and does not offer it in the fire. The reason\nwhy he eats the fast-food and does not offer it in the fire is this:\n\n3:2:2:1111\\. By means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority\nwhich they now wield. They spake, \'How can this (world) of ours be made\nunattainable to men?\' They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, even as bees would\nsuck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of\nthe sacrificial post, they disappeared. And because they scattered (yopaya)\ntherewith, therefore it is called yupa (post).\n\n3:2:2:1212\\. Now this was heard by the _Ri_ shis. They collected the\nsacrifice. As that sacrifice was collected, so does he who is consecrated now\nbecome the sacrifice, for it is he that carries it on, that produces it. And\nwhatever (sap) of the sacrifice was sucked out and drained, that he now\nrestores again by sipping the fast-milk and not offering it in the fire; for,\nassuredly, were he to offer it in the fire, he would not replenish (the\nsacrifice). But let him, nevertheless, think (that he does so) sacrificing and\nnot the reverse.\n\n3:2:2:1313\\. For, verily, these vital airs are born of the mind, endowed with\nmind 1, of intelligent power 2: Agni is speech; Mitra and Varu _n_ a are the\nout-breathing and the in-breathing; \xc3\x82ditya (the sun) is the eye; and the All-\ngods are the ear,--it is unto these deities that offering is thereby made by\nhim.\n\n3:2:2:1414\\. Now, some add both rice and barley to the first (day\'s) fast-\nmilk, arguing,--"By means of these two substances (rasa) we restore what part\nof the sacrifice was sucked out and drained; and, should\n\np. 40\n\nthe vrata-cow yield no milk, he may prepare his fast-food of whichever of\nthese (cereals) he pleases; and thus both the rice and the barley are \'taken\nhold of\' by him." But let him not do this; for he who adds both rice and\nbarley (to the milk) neither replenishes the sacrifice nor heals it. Let him\ntherefore add only the one or the other (cereal). Both the rice and barley\ndoubtless form his (havis) material for offering (at the New and Full-moon\nSacrifice), and when they do so become his material for offering, then they\nare also \'taken hold of 1\' by him. Should the vrata, cow yield no milk, let\nhim prepare the fast-food of whichever of them he pleases.\n\n3:2:2:1515\\. Some, again, add to the first (day\'s) fast-food (vrata) all\nmanner of vegetables and fragrant (seasoning), arguing,--\'If disease were to\nbefall him, he might cure it by whatever thereof he pleases, as if he cured it\nby the fast-milk 2.\' But let him not\n\np. 41\n\ndo this, lest he should do what is inauspicious to the sacrifice; for those\npeople do at the sacrifice what is a human act, and inauspicious to the\nsacrifice assuredly is that which is human. If any disease were to befall him\nwho is consecrated, let him cure it wherewith he pleases; for completion is\nproper 1.\n\n3:2:2:1616\\. He (the Adhvaryu) hands the fast-food to him, after letting the\nordinary (meal-)time pass,--viz. the evening-milk in the latter part of the\nnight, and the morning-milk in the afternoon,--for the sake of distinction: he\nthereby distinguishes the divine from the human.\n\n3:2:2:1717\\. And when he is about to hand the fast-food to him he makes him\ntouch water 2, with the text, \'For protection we direct our thoughts to divine\ndevotion, the source of supreme mercy 3, the bestower of glory and the bearer\nof sacrifices 4: may it prosper our ways, according to our desire!\'\nHeretofore, indeed, it was for a human meal that he cleansed himself, but now\nit is for the sake of divine devotion: therefore he says, \'For the sake of\nassistance we turn our thoughts to divine devotion, the source of supreme\nmercy, the bestower of glory, the bearer of sacrifices: may it\n\np. 42\n\nprosper our ways, according to our desire!\' Whenever, being about to take the\nfast-food, he touches water, let him touch it with this same (formula).\n\n3:2:2:1818\\. Thereupon he drinks the fast-food, with the text, \'May the gods\nfavour us, they who are born of the mind, and endowed with mind 1, and of\nintelligent power! may they protect us! Hail to them!\' Thus that (fast-food)\ncomes to be for him (by means of the Svaha) as an oblation consecrated by the\nVasha _t_.\n\n3:2:2:1919\\. Having drank the fast-food, he touches his navel 2, with the text\n(Va _g_. S. IV, 12), \'Ye waters that have been drank, may ye become palatable\nand auspicious within us! may they prove agreeable to us, freeing us from\ndisease and weakness and sin,--they the divine, the immortal, the holy!\' Now,\nhe who is consecrated draws nigh to the gods and becomes one of the deities;\nbut the sacrificial food of the gods is not increased (with other material):\nhence, if in handing the fast-food (to the consecrated) he increases it (with\nother milk), he commits a fault and breaks the fast. This (formula), however,\nis the atonement for that (transgression), and thus that fault is not\ncommitted by him, and he does not break the fast (or  vow): therefore he says,\n\'Ye waters . . . !\' Whenever, after drinking the fast-food, he touches his\nnavel, let him touch it with this (formula); for who\n\np. 43\n\nknows whether (or not) he who hands the fast-food (to the consecrated)\nincreases it (with other milk) 1!\n\n3:2:2:2020\\. When he intends to pass urine, he takes up a clod of earth or\nsome other object by means of the deer\'s horn, with the text (Va _g_. S. IV,\n13), \'This (O Earth) is thy covering meet for worship.\' For this earth truly\nis divine, and serves as a place for the worship of the gods: it must not be\ndefiled by him who is consecrated. Having lifted up this its sacrificially\npure covering 2, he now relieves himself on its impure body, with the formula,\n\'I discharge not offspring, but waters,\'--for so indeed he does 3; \'delivering\nfrom trouble, and consecrated by Svaha,\'--for they do indeed deliver from\ntrouble what is pressed together inside: therefore he says, \'delivering from\ntrouble,\'--\'consecrated by Svaha, enter ye the earth!\' whereby he means to\nsay, \'Having become offerings, do ye enter the earth, appeased!\'\n\n3:2:2:2121\\. Thereupon he throws the clod of earth down again, with the text,\n\'Unite with the earth!\' for truly this earth is divine, and serves as a place\nfor the worship of the gods: it must not be defiled by him who is consecrated.\nHaving lifted up this its\n\np. 44\n\nsacrificially pure covering, he has relieved himself on its impure body, and\nnow restores to it this its pure covering: therefore he says, \'Unite with the\nearth!\'\n\n3:2:2:2222\\. He then gives himself up to Agni (the fire) for protection and\nlies down to sleep. For he who is consecrated draws nigh to the gods and\nbecomes one of the deities; but the gods do not sleep, while to him\nsleeplessness is not vouchsafed; and Agni being Lord of vows to the gods, it\nis to him that he now commits himself and lies down to sleep, with the text\n(Va _g_. S. IV, 14), \'O Agni, be thou a good waker: may we thoroughly refresh\nourselves!\' whereby he says, \'O Agni, wake thou: we are going to\nsleep!\'--\'Guard us unremittingly!\' whereby he means to say, \'protect us\nheedfully!\'--\'Make us awake again!\' whereby he means to say, \'Order so that,\nhaving rested here, we may awake safely.\'\n\n3:2:2:2323\\. And when he has slept and does not wish to fall asleep again,\n(the Adhvaryu) makes him mutter the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 15), \'Thought and\nlife have come back to me, breath and soul have come back to me, eye and ear\nhave come back to me;\' for all these depart from him when he sleeps; the\nbreath alone does not; and after he has slept he again unites with them:\ntherefore he says, \'Thought and life have come back to me . . .\'--\'May Agni\nVai _s_ vanara, the unassailable preserver of lives, preserve us from mishap\nand shame!\' whereby he means to say, \'May Agni save us from whatever mistake\n(may be committed) on this occasion, either by sleep or otherwise:\' this is\nwhy he says, \'May Agni Vai _s_ vanara, the unassailable preserver of lives,\npreserve us from mishap and shame!\'\n\n3:2:2:2424\\. For, when he who is consecrated utters anything\n\np. 45\n\nthat is foreign to the vow, or when he becomes angry, he commits a fault and\nbreaks his vow, since suppression of anger behoves him who is consecrated.\nNow, Agni is the Lord of vows among the gods,--it is to him therefore that he\nresorts (Va _g_. S. IV, 16; Rig-veda VIII, II, 7): \'Thou, O Agni, art the\ndivine guardian of vows among men, to whom praise is due at the sacrifices.\'\nThis, then, is his atonement for that (transgression); and thus that fault is\nnot committed by him, and he does not break his vow: therefore he says, \'Thou,\nO Agni, art the divine guardian of vows among men, to whom praise is due at\nthe sacrifices.\'\n\n3:2:2:2525\\. And whatever (gift) people offer to him 1, thereon he (the\nAdhvaryu) makes him pronounce the text, \'Bestow this much, O Soma, bring\nmore!\' for Soma indeed it is that appropriates for the consecrated whatever\npeople offer to him: when he says, \'Bestow this much, O Soma,\' he means to\nsay, \'Bestow this much on us, O Soma;\' and by \'Bring more,\' he means to say,\n\'Fetch more for us!\'--\'The divine Savit _ri_ , the bestower of wealth, hath\nbestowed wealth on us;\' whereby that (gift) comes to be impelled by Savit _ri_\nwith a view to (further) gifts.\n\n3:2:2:2626\\. Before sunset he (the Adhvaryu) says, \'Consecrated, restrain thy\nspeech!\' and after sunset he releases speech. Before sunrise he says,\n\'Consecrated, restrain thy speech!\' and after sunrise he releases\n\np. 46\n\nhis speech,--for the sake of continuity: with the night he continues the day,\nand with the day the night.\n\n3:2:2:2727\\. Let not the sun set on him while abiding elsewhere (than the\nhall); nor let the sun rise on him while asleep. For were the sun to set on\nhim while abiding elsewhere, he (the sun) would cut him off from the night;\nand were the sun to rise on him while asleep, he would cut him off from the\nday: there is no atonement for this, hence it must by all means be avoided.\nPrior to the purificatory bath he should not enter water, nor should it rain\nupon him; for it is improper that he should enter water, or that it should\nrain upon him, before the purificatory bath. Moreover, he speaks his speech\nfalteringly, and not effusively after the manner of ordinary speech 1. The\nreason why he speaks his speech falteringly and not after the manner of\nordinary speech is this:\n\n3:2:2:2828\\. By means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority\nwhich they now wield. They spake, \'How can this (world) of ours be made\nunattainable to men?\' They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, even as bees would\nsuck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of\nthe sacrificial post, they disappeared. And because they scattered (yopaya)\ntherewith, therefore it is called yupa (post).\n\n3:2:2:2929\\. Now this was heard by the _Ri_ shis. They collected the\nsacrifice; and as that sacrifice was collected, so does he who is consecrated\nnow collect the sacrifice (by keeping back his speech),--for the sacrifice is\nspeech. And whatever part of the sacrifice\n\np. 47\n\nwas then sucked out and drained, that he now restores again by speaking his\nspeech falteringly and not effusively after the manner of ordinary speech. For\nwere he to speak effusively after the manner of ordinary speech, he would not\nrestore (the sap of the sacrifice): therefore he speaks his speech falteringly\nand not effusively after the manner of ordinary speech.\n\n3:2:2:3030\\. He verily anoints himself,--it is for speech that he anoints\nhimself 1, since he anoints himself for the sacrifice, and the sacrifice is\nspeech. Dhikshita (the anointed) doubtless is the same as dikshita (the\nconsecrated).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[36:1](sbe2608.htm#fr_101) Professor Whitney (American Journal of Philology,\nIII, p. 402) proposes to take yopaya here in the sense of \'to set up an\nobstacle, to block or bar the way.\' He remarks, \'How the setting up of a post\nshould operate to "efface traces" cannot easily be made to appear.\' I am not\naware that any one has supposed that it was by the \'setting up\' of the post\nthat the traces of the sacrifice were obliterated. From what follows--\'They\ncollected the sacrifice \'--it seems to me pretty clear that our author at any\nrate connects \'yopaya\' with the root yu, to mix, stir about, and hence to\nefface the traces by mixing with the ground, or by scattering about. This\ncausative was evidently no longer a living form, but resorted to for\netymological purposes.\n\n[36:2](sbe2608.htm#fr_102) Or, perhaps, They collected the sacrifice in the\nsame way as this (present) sacrifice has been collected. See, however, the\ncorresponding passage [III, 2, 2, 29](sbe2608.htm#3:2:2:29); [4, 3,\n16](sbe2617.htm#3:4:3:16). The Ka _n_ va text is clearer: Ta _m_ yatha\nyatharshayo ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _m_ samabhara _m_ s tathaya _m_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_\nsambh _ri_ to yatho vai tad _ri_ shayo ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am samabharann evam u va\nesha etad ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _m_ sambharati yo dikshate.\n\n[37:1](sbe2608.htm#fr_103) \'After pointing out (some) stars [nakshatra _n_ i\ndar _s_ ayitva],\' Ka _n_ va recension. Cf. Taitt. S. VI, 1, 4, 4, \'when the\nstars have risen, he breaks silence with "Prepare the fast-food!"\'\n\n[37:2](sbe2608.htm#fr_104) That is to say, the eating of the fast-food,\nconsisting chiefly of milk, takes, as it were, the place of the Agnihotra, or\nevening and morning sacrifice, which he is not allowed to perform during the\ntime of his consecration.\n\n[38:1](sbe2608.htm#fr_105) Viz. the injunction \'Prepare ye the fast-food!\'\nwhich is indeed read thrice in the Ka _n_ va text, where the arrangement of\nthese paragraphs is much clearer.\n\n[38:2](sbe2608.htm#fr_106) Thus Say. \'ato \'nyena, bhur bhuva _h_ suvar\nityanena\' (MS. I. O. 657). Dr. Lindner makes ata _h_ refer to Agni. The Ka _n_\nva text begins the passage, corresponding to paragraphs 7 and 8: \'So \'gnim\nikshama _n_ o vis _ri_ _g_ ate vrata _m_ kri _n_ uta (thrice) etad va etasya\nhavir esha ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ o yad vratam.\'\n\n[38:3](sbe2608.htm#fr_107) That is, the words \'Agni is the Brahman.\'\n\n[38:4](sbe2608.htm#fr_108) Viz. because \'the Brahman (neut.) is the truth (or\nessence, satyam),\' Say.\n\n[38:5](sbe2608.htm#fr_109) Viz. trees from which sacrificial implements, fire-\nwood, the sacrificial stake, &c., are obtained.\n\n[39:1](sbe2608.htm#fr_110) Manoyu _g_ (?), \'mind-yoked,\' i.e. having thoughts\nfor their team.\n\n[39:2](sbe2608.htm#fr_111) Cf. [paragraph 18](sbe2608.htm#3:2:2:18).\n\n[40:1](sbe2608.htm#fr_112) Anvarabdha has here the usual sacrificial meaning\nof \'taken hold of (from behind),\' with perhaps something of that of \'taken (as\nmedicine = einnehmen).\' Thus at the invocation of the I _d_ a, the sacrificer\nhas to touch (anv-arabh) the i _d_ a from behind, thereby keeping up his\nconnection, and identifying himself, with the sacrifice. Cf. part i, p. 228,\nnote 1; and [III, 2, 4, 15](sbe2610.htm#3:2:4:15). Hence the author, making\nuse of the term suggested by those he criticises, argues that as both kinds of\nmaterial have already been used and therefore touched (anvarabdha) by him at\nthe New and Full-moon Sacrifice (Saya _n_ a), they have therefore been taken\npossession of by him. It is possible, though scarcely likely, that the verb\nmay have reference here to the anvarambha _n_ iya ish _t_ i,--or preliminary\nceremony of the first performance of the New and Full-moon Sacrifice,--with\nwhich the present use of these cereals would, in that case, be identified, as\nthat of the vrata-milk was with the Agnihotra (cf. [paragraph\n7](sbe2608.htm#3:2:2:7) above). The Ka _n_ va text has the verb a-rabh\ninstead, yatha havisharabdhena bhisha _g_ yed ity evam etat.\n\n[40:2](sbe2608.htm#fr_113) That is to say, though the restoration might be due\nto the medicinal properties of some of those ingredients, it could be ascribed\nto the milk.\n\n[41:1](sbe2608.htm#fr_114) Saya _n_ a takes this to mean, that, as above all\nthe consummation of the sacrifice is desirable, one should in case of disease\ncure it by any of those drugs without their being taken (anvarabdha)\nsacrificially, or as part of the sacrificial performance.\n\n[41:2](sbe2608.htm#fr_115) According to the Ka _n_ va text, the sacrificer\nfirst washes himself (nenikte) and then sips water (a _k_ amati); and having\ndrunk the fast-milk, he touches water (apa upasp _ri_ _s_ ati).\n\n[41:3](sbe2608.htm#fr_116) Or, perhaps, we meditate on the divine\nintelligence, the most merciful.\'\n\n[41:4](sbe2608.htm#fr_117) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avahasam (\'bringing, or bearing,\nworship\'); thus also Taitt. S. I, 2, 2. The Ka _n_ va text reads vi _s_\nvadhayasam, \'all-nourishing, all-sustaining.\'\n\n[42:1](sbe2608.htm#fr_118) See p. 39, note 2. The Ka _n_ va text here again\nidentifies the divinities referred to in the text with the vital airs.\n\n[42:2](sbe2608.htm#fr_119) Having eaten and touched water, he strokes his\nbelly (udaram abhim _ri_ _s_ ate), Ka _n_ v. The Ka _n_ va text renders the\nmeaning quite clear: Uta vai tivra _m_ vratam bhavati tat kshudrataram asad\niti vopotsi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ aty, alpa _m_ va bhavati tad bhuyaskamyopotsi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ati.\n\n[43:1](sbe2608.htm#fr_120) No other fresh milk is to be added to that obtained\nby one milking of the vratadugha (fast-milk) cow (Katy. VII, 4, 29); but the\npreceding formula is to be muttered in order to obviate any evil consequences\narising from a possible secret breach of this rule, on the part of him who\nhands the milk to the sacrificer. Dr. Lindner takes upotsi _k_ in the sense of\n\'to spill,\' but I find no authority for this rendering, which neither the\nprep. upa, nor abhi (in the equivalent abhyutsi _k_ ) would seem to admit of.\n\n[43:2](sbe2608.htm#fr_121) See [p. 10](sbe2604.htm#page_10), note\n[4](sbe2604.htm#fn_40).\n\n[43:3](sbe2608.htm#fr_122) \'Ubhaya _m_ va ata ety apa _s_ _k_ a reta _s_ _k_\na; sa etad apa eva mu _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ati na pra _g_ am.\'\n\n[45:1](sbe2608.htm#fr_123) \'And if they were to bring him either a garment or\na cow, let him address it with the text--.\' Ka _n_ va text. According to some\nauthorities the Dikshita is to go about for twelve days begging his means of\nsubsistence, and whatever he obtains he is to touch and consecrate by the\nabove text. Katy.

Dict. s. v.) Cf. [III, 1, 3, 7](sbe2605.htm#3:1:3:7)\nseq. The construction (especially the first hi) is rather peculiar. This\nparagraph apparently is to supply further proof why he should be cautious in\nhis speech, and the words \'sa vai dhikshate\' have to be taken parenthetically:\n\'He speaks his speech cautiously . . . .; for (anointing himself as he does)\nhe anoints himself for speech, &c.\' The Ka _n_ va text offers less difficulty:\nAtha yad dhikshito nama va _k_ e va esha etad dhikshate, ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya hi\ndhikshate, ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ o hi vak, tasmad dhikshito nama, dhikshito ha vai\nnamaitad yad dikshita ity ahu _h_.
