Prayer for protection addressed to a talisman made from wood of\nthe sraktya-tree.\n\n1\\. This attacking talisman, (itself) a man, is fastened upon the man: it is\nfull of force, slays enemies, makes heroes of men, furnishes shelter, provides\ngood luck.  \n2\\. This talisman slays enemies, makes strong men, is powerful, lusty,\nvictorious, strong; as a man it advances against sorceries and destroys them.  \n3\\. With this talisman Indra slew Vritra, with it he, full of device,\ndestroyed the Asuras, with it he conquered both the heaven and earth, with it\nhe conquered the four regions of space.  \n4\\. This talisman of sraktya assails and attacks. With might controlling the\nenemies, it shall protect us on all sides!  \n5\\. Agni has said this, and Soma has said this; Brihaspati, Savitar, Indra\n(have said) this. These divine purohitas, (chaplains) shall turn back for me\n(upon the sorcerer) the sorceries with aggressive amulets!  \n6\\. I have interposed heaven and earth, also the day, and also the sun. These\ndivine purohitas (chaplains) shall turn back for me (upon the sorcerer) the\nsorceries with aggressive amulets!  \n7\\. (For) the folk that make an armour of the talisman of sraktya--like the\nsun ascending the sky, it subjects and beats off the sorceries.  \n8\\. With the amulet of sraktya, as if with a seer of powerful spirit, I have\ngained all battles, I slay the enemies, the Rakshas.  \n9\\. The sorceries that come from the Angiras, the sorceries that come from the\nAsuras, the sorceries that prepare themselves, and those that are prepared by\nothers, both these shall go away to a distance across ninety navigable\nstreams!  \n10\\. As an armour upon him the gods shall tie the amulet, Indra, Vishnu,\nSavitar, Rudra, Agni, Pragapati, Parameshthin, Virag,Vaisvanara, and the seers\nall.  \n11\\. Thou art the most superb of plants, as if a steer among the cattle, as if\na tiger among beasts of prey. (The amulet) that we did seek, that have we\nfound, a guardian at our side.  \n12\\. He that wears this talisman, verily is a tiger, a lion as well, and, too,\na bull; moreover a curtailer of enemies.  \n13\\. Him slay not the Apsaras, nor the Gandharvas, nor mortal men; all reoions\ndoes he rule, that wears this talisman.  \n14\\. Kasyapa has created thee, Kasyapa has produced thee. Indra wore thee in\nhuman (battle); wearing thee in the close combat he conquered. The gods did\nmake the talisman an armour of thousandfold strength.  \n15\\. He that plans to harm thee with sorceries, with (unholy) consecrations\nand sacrifices--him beat thou back, O Indra, with thy thunderbolt that hath a\nhundred joints!  \n16\\. This talisman verily does assail, full of might, victorious. Offspring\nand wealth it shall protect, provide defence, abound in luck!  \n17\\. Remove our enemies in the south, remove our enemies in the north; remove,\nO Indra, our enemies in the west: light, O hero, place in front (east) of us!  \n18\\. An armour for me be heaven and earth, an armour day, an armour the sun!\nAn armour for me be Indra and Agni; Dhatar shall bestow (dadhAtu) an armour\nupon me!  \n19\\. The armour of Indra and Agni, that is thick and strong, all the gods\nunited do not pierce. This great (armour) shall protect my body on all sides,\nthat I may obtain long life, and reach old age!  \n20\\. The divine talisman has ascended upon me,unto completc exemption from\ninjury. Assemble about this post that protects the body, furnishes threefold\ndefence, in order to (secure) strength!  \n21\\. Into it Indra shall deposit manliness: do ye, O gods, assemble about it\nfor long life, for life lasting a hundred autumns, that he may reach old age.  \n22\\. May Indra who bestows welfare, the lord of the people, the slayer of\nVritra, the controller of enemies, he that conquereth and is unconquered, the\nsoma-drinking bull that frees from danger, fasten the amulet upon thee: may it\nprotect thee on each and every side, by day and by night!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 3.
