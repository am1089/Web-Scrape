 \nMe also, me 'twere surely good  \nTo banish to the distant wood,  \nTo dwell amid the shades that hold  \nMy famous son with limbs like gold.  \nNay, with the sacred fire to guide,  \nWill I, Sumitra by my side,  \nMyself to the drear wood repair  \nAnd seek the son of Raghu there.  \nThis land which rice and golden corn  \nAnd wealth of every kind adorn,  \nCar, elephant, and steed, and gem,--  \nShe makes thee lord of it and them.'  \n\nWith taunts like these her bitter tongue  \nThe heart of blameless Bharat wrung  \nAnd direr pangs his bosom tore  \nThan when the lancet probes a sore.  \nWith troubled senses all astray  \nProne at her feet he fell and lay.  \nWith loud lament a while he plained,  \nAnd slowly strength and sense regained.  \nWith suppliant hand to hand applied  \nHe turned to her who wept and sighed,  \nAnd thus bespake the queen, whose breast  \nWith sundry woes was sore distressed:  \n'Why these reproaches, noble dame?  \nI, knowing naught, am free from blame.  \nThou knowest well what love was mine  \nFor Rama, chief of Raghu's line.  \nO, never be his darkened mind  \nTo Scripture's guiding lore inclined,  \nBy whose consent the prince who led  \nThe good, the truthful hero, fled.  \nMay he obey the vilest lord,  \nOffend the sun with act abhorred,  1  \nAnd strike a sleeping cow, who lent  \nHis voice to Rama's banishment.  \nMay the good king who all befriends,  \nAnd, like his sons, the people tends,  \nBe wronged by him who gave consent  \nTo noble Rama's banishment.  \nOn him that king's injustice fall,  \nWho takes, as lord, a sixth of all,  \nNor guards, neglectful of his trust,  \nHis people, as a ruler must.  \nThe crime of those who swear to fee,  \nAt holy rites, some devotee,  \nAnd then the promised gift deny,  \nBe his who willed the prince should fly,  \nWhen weapons clash and heroes bleed,  \nWith elephant and harnessed steed,  \nNe'er, like the good, be his to fight  \nWhose heart allowed the prince's flight.  \nThough taught with care by one expert  \nMay he the Veda's text pervert,  \nWith impious mind on evil bent,  \nWhose voice approved the banishment.  \nMav he with traitor lips reveal  \nWhate'er he promised to conceal,  \nAnd bruit abroad his friend's offence,  \nBetrayed by generous confidence.  \nNo wife of equal lineage born  \nThe wretch's joyless home adorn:  \nNe'er may he do one virtuous deed,  \nAnd dying see no child succeed.  \nWhen in the battle's awful day  \nFierce warriors stand in dread array,  \nLet the base coward turn and fly,  \nAnd smitten by the foeman, die.  \nLong may he wander, rags his wear,  \nDoomed in his hand a skull to bear,  \nAnd like an idiot beg his bread,  \nWho gave consent when Rama fled.  \nHis sin who holy rites forgets,  \nAsleep when shows the sun and sets,  \nA load upon his soul shall lie  \nWhose will allowed the prince to fly.  \nHis sin who loves his Master's dame,  \nHis, kindler of destructive flame.  \nHis who betrays his trusting friend  \nShall, mingled all, on him descend.  \nBy him no reverence due be paid  \nTo blessed God or parted shade:  \nMay sire and mother's sacred name  \nIn vain from him obedience claim.  \nNe'er may he go where dwell the good,  \nNor win their fame and neighbourhood,  \nBut lose all hopes of bliss to day,  \nWho willed the prince should flee away.  \nMay he deceive the poor and weak  \nWho look to him and comfort seek,  \n\np. 185  \n\nBetray the suppliants who complain,  \nAnd make the hopeful hope in vain.  \nLong may his wife his kiss expect,  \nAnd pine away in cold neglect.  \nMay he his lawful love despise,  \nAnd turn on other dames his eyes,  \nFool, on forbidden joys intent,  \nWhose will allowed the banishment.  \nHis sin who deadly poison throws  \nTo spoil the water as it flows,  \nLay on the wretch its burden dread  \nWho gave consent when Rama fled.' [1](ry154.htm#fn_351)  \n\nThus with his words he undeceived  \nKaus'alya's troubled heart, who grieved  \nFor son and husband reft away;  \nThen prostrate on the ground he lay.  \nHim as he lay half-senseless there,  \nFreed by the mighty oaths he sware,  \nKaus'alya, by her woe distressed,  \nWith melancholy words addressed:  \n'Anew, my son, this sorrow springs  \nTo rend my heart with keener stings:  \nThese awful oaths which thou hast sworn  \nMy breast with double grief have torn.  \nThy soul, and faithful Lakshman's too,  \nAre still, thank Heaven! to virtue true.  \nTrue to thy promise, thou shalt gain  \nThe mansions which the good obtain.'  \n\nThen to her breast that youth she drew,  \nWhose sweet fraternal love she knew,  \nAnd there in strict embraces held  \nThe hero, as her tears outwelled.  \nAnd Bharat's heart grew sick and faint  \nWith grief and oft-renewed complaint,  \nAnd all his senses were distraught  \nBy the great woe that in him wrought.  \nThus he lay and still bewailed  \n   With sighs and loud lament  \nTill all his strength and reason failed,  \n   The hours of night were spent.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[184:1](ry153.htm#fr_350) _S' uryamcha pratimehata_, adversus solem mingat.
