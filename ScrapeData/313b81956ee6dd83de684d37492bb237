The text of the Sutra consists of the\nsingle word 'penance' in the singular, which, being the adhikara or heading,\nmust be taken with each of the following Sutras down to the end of chapter\nXXIII.\n\n[283:2](sbe0286.htm#fr_1392) Manu XI, 74.\n\n[283:3](sbe0286.htm#fr_1393) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 11.\n\n[283:4](sbe0286.htm#fr_1394) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 24, 11-20. Haradatta says, 'the\nfoot of a bedstead' (kha _t_ va\xe1\xb9\x85ga) is known in the case of the Pa _s_ upatas,\nand indicates thereby that he interprets the term to mean 'a club shaped like\nthe foot of a bedstead,' which the Pa _s_ upatas wear.\n\n[283:5](sbe0286.htm#fr_1395) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 24, 13.\n\n[284:6](sbe0286.htm#fr_1396) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 10.\n\n[284:7](sbe0286.htm#fr_1397) Manu XI, 80; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 244-245.\n\n[284:8](sbe0286.htm#fr_1398) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 21.\n\n[284:9](sbe0286.htm#fr_1399) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 22.\n\n[284:10](sbe0286.htm#fr_1400) Haradatta names the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ aratra sacrifice\nas an instance of a _S_ rauta ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, of which an Agnish _t_ ut forms\npart. He adds that another commentator explain s the Sutra to mean, 'or at any\nother sacrifice, provided that an Agnish _t_ ut sacrifice be its final\nceremony.' Regarding the Agnish _t_ ut sacrifice, see also above, XIX, 10.\n\n[284:11](sbe0286.htm#fr_1401) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 252.\n\n[284:12](sbe0286.htm#fr_1402) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 24, 9; Manu XI, 88; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya III, 251.\n\n[284:13](sbe0286.htm#fr_1403) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 24, 8; Manu, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,\nloc. cit.\n\n[284:14](sbe0286.htm#fr_1404) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 24, 1, 4. 'Prak _ri_ ta (normal)\nmeans natural p. 285 (svabhavika), i.e. not accompanied by the carrying of the\nfoot of a bedstead and the rest.'--Haradatta.\n\n[285:15](sbe0286.htm#fr_1405) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 24, 2, 4.\n\n[285:16](sbe0286.htm#fr_1406) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 24, 3, 4.\n\n[285:17](sbe0286.htm#fr_1407) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 24, 5; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III,\n269. Haradatta says that this rule refers to the expiation of the murder of a\nvirtuous Brahma _n_ i.\n\n[285:18](sbe0286.htm#fr_1408) \xc3\x82pastamba, I, 9, 26, 5; Manu XI, 109-116; Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 263. Haradatta thinks that the Sutra refers to the cow of a\nvirtuous _S_ rotriya or of a poor Brahma _n_ a who has many children.\n\n[285:19](sbe0286.htm#fr_1409) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 13. Haradatta explains\ndahara to mean a small mouse, but gives the meaning assigned to it in the\ntranslation as the opinion of others. He states that all the animals named\nmust have been intentionally injured and together.\n\n[285:20](sbe0286.htm#fr_1410) Manu XI, 142; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 275.\n\n[285:21](sbe0286.htm#fr_1411) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 26, 2.\n\n[286:22](sbe0286.htm#fr_1412) Haradatta quotes a verse showing that\n'something' means eight handfuls (mush _t_ i) of grain.\n\n[286:23](sbe0286.htm#fr_1413) Manu XI, 134; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 273.\n\n[286:24](sbe0286.htm#fr_1414) Manu XI, 135.\n\n[286:25](sbe0286.htm#fr_1415) Manu XI, 34; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 273.\nPossibly da _n_ _d_ a, a bar, denotes here a particular measure, as a da _n_\n_d_ a is said to be equal to four hastas or ninety-six a\xe1\xb9\x85gulis.\n\n[286:26](sbe0286.htm#fr_1416) Manu XI, 139.\n\n[286:29](sbe0286.htm#fr_1417)-30. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 110, 27, 11.\n\n[286:33](sbe0286.htm#fr_1418) Haradatta says that by the employment of Vedic\ntexts, teaching or sacrificing is meant, but that others refer the Sutra p.\n287 to the performance of these acts in the company of, not for unworthy\npeople.\n\n[287:35](sbe0286.htm#fr_1419) Manu XI, 189; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 297.\n\n[287:36](sbe0286.htm#fr_1420) Manu XI, 174.
