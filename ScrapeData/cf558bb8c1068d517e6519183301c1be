A drunkard, a madman, a prisoner, he who learns the Veda from his son, a\ncreditor who sits with his debtor (hindering the fulfilment of his duties), a\ndebtor who thus sits (with his creditor, are persons whose food must not be\neaten) as long as they are thus engaged or in that state. 1\n\n2\\. Who (then) are those whose food may be eaten? 2\n\np. 70\n\n3\\. Ka _n_ va declares, that it is he who wishes to give.\n\n4\\. Kautsa declares, that it is he who is holy. 4\n\n5\\. Varshyaya _n_ i declares, that it is every giver (of food).\n\n6\\. For if guilt remains fixed on the man (who committed a crime, then food\ngiven by a sinner) may be eaten (because the guilt cannot leave the sinner).\nBut if guilt can leave (the sinner at any time, then food given by the sinner\nmay be eaten because) he becomes pure by the gift (which he makes).\n\n7\\. Offered food, which is pure, may be eaten, according to Eka, Ku _n_ ika,\nKa _n_ va, Kutsa, and Pushkarasadi.\n\n8\\. Varshyaya _n_ i's opinion is, that (food) given unasked (may be accepted)\nfrom anybody.\n\n9\\. (Food offered) willingly by a holy man may be eaten.\n\n10\\. Food given unwillingly by a holy man ought not to be eaten. 10\n\n11\\. Food offered unasked by any person whatsoever may be eaten,\n\n12\\. 'But not if it be given after an express previous announcement;' thus\nsays Harita.\n\n13\\. Now they quote also in a Pura _n_ a the following two verses: 13\n\np. 71\n\n'The Lord of creatures has declared, that food offered unasked and brought by\nthe giver himself, may be eaten, though (the giver be) a sinner, provided the\ngift has not been announced beforehand. The Manes of the ancestors of that man\nwho spurns such food, do not eat (his oblations) for fifteen years, nor does\nthe fire carry his offerings (to the gods).'\n\n14\\. (Another verse from a Pura _n_ a declares): 'The food given by a\nphysician, a hunter, a surgeon, a fowler, an unfaithful wife, or a eunuch must\nnot be eaten.' 14\n\n15\\. Now (in confirmation of this) they quote (the following verse): 'The\nmurderer of a Brahma _n_ a learned in the Veda heaps his guilt on his guest,\nan innocent man on his calumniator, a thief set at liberty on the king, and\nthe petitioner on him who makes false promises.' 15\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[69:1](sbe0222.htm#fr_424) **19**. Manu IV, 207; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 161, 162.\nAnother commentator explains a _n_ ika, translated above 'he who learns the\nVeda from his son,' by 'a money-lender,' and combines pratyupavish _t_ a _h_\nwith this word, i.e. 'a money-lender who sits with his debtor hindering him\nfrom fulfilling his duties.' This manner of forcing a debtor to pay, which is\nalso called \xc3\x82 _k_ arita (see Manu VIII, 49), is, though illegal, resorted to\nsometimes even now.\n\n[69:2](sbe0222.htm#fr_425) 'The object of this Sutra is to introduce the great\nvariety of opinions quoted below.'--Haradatta.\n\n[70:4](sbe0222.htm#fr_426) 'Holy' means not only 'following his lawful\noccupations,' but particularly 'practising austerities, reciting prayers, and\noffering burnt-oblations.'--Haradatta.\n\n[70:10](sbe0222.htm#fr_427) Another commentator explains this Sutra thus: 'He\nneed not eat the food offered by a righteous man, if he himself does not wish\nto do so.'--Haradatta.\n\n[70:13](sbe0222.htm#fr_428) See Manu IV, 248 and 249, where these identical\nverses occur.\n\n[71:14](sbe0222.htm#fr_429) Manu IV, 211, 212.\n\n[71:15](sbe0222.htm#fr_430) Regarding the liberation of the thief, see\n\xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 4. A similar verse occurs Manu VIII, 317, which has caused\nthe confusion observable in many MSS., as has been stated in the critical\nnotes to the text.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 7, Kha _n_ _d_ a 20](sbe0223.htm)\n\n"
