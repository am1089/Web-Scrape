With the exception of world-business (the released possess all lordly\npower), (the Lord) being the topic (where world-business is referred to), and\n(the souls) not being near (to such business).\n\nThe following doubt here presents itself. Do those who through meditations on\nthe qualified Brahman enter, together with their manas, into a condition of\nequality with the Lord, possess unlimited lordly power, or power limited to\nsome extent?--The purvapakshin maintains that their power must be unlimited,\nbecause we meet with texts such as 'He obtains Self-lordship' (Taitt. Sa _m_\nh. I, 6, 2); 'All the gods bring an offering for him' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. I, 5,\n3); 'For them there is freedom in all worlds' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 6)--To this\nthe Sutra replies, 'Excepting the world-business.' With the exception of the\norigination and so on of the world all other lordly powers, as e.g. rendering\none's self of atomic size, must belong to the released. The world-business, on\nthe other hand, can belong to the everlastingly\n\np. 416\n\nperfect Lord only.--Why so?--Because there (where the origination and so on of\nthe world are referred to) the Lord forms the general topic, and because the\nother (souls) do not stand near (to the world-business). The highest Lord only\nis appointed to do all work referring to the entire world; for the world's\norigination and so on are taught only where he constitutes the general\nsubject-matter, and moreover he (only) is eternal, and described in scripture\n(as the creator, &c. of the world) [1](sbe38334.htm#fn_236). The lordly power\nof the other souls, on the contrary, scripture shows to have a beginning,\nbecause it depends on their searching for and striving to know the Lord. They\nare therefore remote from all world-business. And just because they have\nminds, they might be of different minds, and one might have the intention of\npreserving the world while another might wish to destroy it. Such conflicts\ncan only be avoided by assuming that the wishes of one should conform to those\nof another, and from this it follows that all other souls (but the Lord)\ndepend on the highest Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 18](sbe38334.htm)\n\n"
