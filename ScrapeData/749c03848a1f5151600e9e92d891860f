The Bhavishya Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n9\\. Bhavishya Puran\xcc\x81a. "The Puran\xcc\x81a in which Brahma, having described the\ngreatness of the sun, explained to Manu the existence of the world, and the\ncharacters of all created things, in the course of the Aghora Kalpa; that, is\ncalled the Bhavishya, the stories being for the most part the events of a\nfuture period. It contains fourteen thousand five hundred stanzas 62." This\nPuran\xcc\x81a, as the name implies, should be a book of prophecies, foretelling what\nwill be (bhavishyati), as the Matsya Puran\xcc\x81a intimates. Whether such a work\nexists is doubtful. The copies, which appear to be entire, and of which there\nare three in the library of the East India Company, agreeing in their contents\nwith two in my possession, contain about seven thousand stanzas. There is\nanother work, entitled the Bhavishyottara, as if it was a continuation or\nsupplement of the former, containing also about seven thousand verses; but the\nsubjects of .both these works are but to a very imperfect degree analogous to\nthose to which the Matsya alludes 63.\n\nThe Bhavishya Puran\xcc\x81a, as I have it, is a work in a hundred and\n\np. xl\n\ntwenty-six short chapters, repeated by Sumantu to \xc5\x9aatanika, a king of the\nPan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u family. He notices, however, its having originated with Swayambhu or\nBrahma; and describes it as consisting of five parts; four dedicated, it\nshould seem, to as many deities, as they are termed, Brahma, Vaishn\xcc\x81ava,\n\xc5\x9aaiva, and Twasht\xcc\x81ra; whilst the fifth is the Pratisarga, or repeated\ncreation. Possibly the first part only may have come into my hands, although\nit does not so appear by the manuscript.\n\nWhatever it may be, the work in question is not a Puran\xcc\x81a. The first portion,\nindeed, treats of creation; but it is little else than a transcript of the\nwords of the first chapter of Manu. The rest is entirely a manual of religious\nrites and ceremonies. It explains the ten Sanskaras, or initiatory rites; the\nperformance of the Sandhya; the reverence to be shewn to a Guru; the duties of\nthe different \xc3\x81sramas and castes; and enjoins a number of Vratas, or\nobservances of fasting and the like, appropriate to different lunar days. A\nfew legends enliven the series of precepts. That of the sage Chyavana is told\nat considerable length, taken chiefly from the Mahabharata. The Naga Panchami,\nor fifth lunation, sacred to the serpent-gods, gives rise to a description of\ndifferent sorts of snakes. After these, which occupy about one-third of the\nchapters, the remainder of them conform in subject to one of the topics\nreferred to by the Matsya. They chiefly represent conversations between\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, his son \xc5\x9aamba, who had become a leper by the curse of Durvasas,\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, Narada, and Vyasa, upon the power and glory of the sun, and the\nmanner in which he is to be worshipped. There is some curious matter in the\nlast chapters, relating to the Magas, silent worshippers of the sun, from\nSakadwipa, as if the compiler had adopted the Persian term Magh, and connected\nthe fire-worshippers of Iran with those of India. This is a subject, however,\nthat requires farther investigation.\n\nThe Bhavishyottara is, equally with the preceding, a sort of manual of\nreligious offices, the greater portion being appropriated to Vratas, and the\nremainder to the forms and circumstances with which gifts are to be presented.\nMany of the ceremonies are obsolete, or are observed in a different manner, as\nthe Rath-yatra, or car festival; and the Madanotsava, or festival of spring.\nThe descriptions of these throw some light\n\np. xli\n\nupon the public condition of the Hindu religion at a period probably prior to\nthe Mohammedan conquest. The different ceremonies are illustrated by legends,\nwhich are sometimes ancient, as, for instance, the destruction of the god of\nlove by \xc5\x9aiva, and his thence becoming Ananga, the disembodied lord of hearts.\nThe work is supposed to be communicated by Krishn\xcc\x81a to Yudhisht\xcc\x81hira, at a\ngreat assemblage of holy persons at the coronation of the latter, after the\nconclusion of the great war.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xxxix:62](vp013.htm#fr_61) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_03900.jpg)\n\n[xxxix:63](vp013.htm#fr_62) Col.
