'Tis well!  \nHis daughter Sita thus bestowed,  \nO'er whom the sacred drops had flowed.  \nKing Janak's heart with rapture glowed.  \nThen to Prince Lakshman thus he cried'.  \n'Take Urmila thine offered bride,  \nAnd clasp her hand within thine own  \nEre yet the lucky hour be flown.'  \nThen to Prince Bharat thus cried he;  \n'Come, take the hand of Mandavi.'  \nThen to S'atrughna: 'In thy grasp  \nThe hand of S'rutakirti clasp.  \nNow, Raghu's sons, may all of you  \nBe gentle to your wives and true;  \n\np. 85  \n\nKeep well the vows you make to-day,  \nNor let occasion slip away.'  \n\nKing Janak's word the youths obeyed;  \nThe maidens' hands in theirs they laid.  \nThen with their brides the princes went  \nWith ordered steps and reverent  \nBound both the tire and Janak, round  \nThe sages and the sacred ground.  \n\nA flowery flood of lucid dyes  \nIn rain descended from the skies,  \nWhile with celestial voices blent  \nSweet strains from many an instrument,  \nAnd the nymphs danced in joyous throng  \nResponsive to the minstrel's song.  \nSuch signs of exultation they  \nSaw on the princes' wedding day.  \nStill rang the heavenly music's sound  \nWhen Raghu's sons thrice circled round  \nThe fire, each one with reverent head,  \nAnd homeward then their brides they led.  \nThey to the sumptuous palace hied  \nThat Janak's care had seen supplied.  \nThe monarch girt with saint and peer  \nStill fondly gazing followed near.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXIV.: Rama With The Axe.](ry074.htm)\n\n"
