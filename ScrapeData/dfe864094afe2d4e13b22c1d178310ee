Suta said :-- O Mahar _s_ is! When the king Sudyumna had gone up to\nheavens, the religious king Pururava, endowed with great beauty and many\nqualities, and able to please the minds of his subjects began to govern his\nkingdom well, according to Dharma, with his heart intent on governing his\npeople. No body knew what his counsel was, but he was very clever in knowing\nothers' counsels. He was always highly energetic and his lordly power was\ngreat. The four methods of warfare, (1) con-ciliation, (2) giving gifts, (3)\nsowing dissensions and (4) war, were fully under his control. He saw that his\nsubjects practised religion according to Varnas'ram (Colours and stages of\nlife), and thus he began to govern his kingdom. Pururava, the lord of men,\nperformed various sacrifices with abundance of Dak _s_ i _n_ as (sacrificial\nfees) and also gave away much in various charities, causing great wonder and\nastonishment. His extra-ordinary beauty and qualities, liberality and good\nnature, his unbounded wealth and prowess made the Apsara Urvas\xc2\x92i (celestial\nnymph) think of him often and she wanted him to satisfy her. Some time passed\nwhen that procud Urvas'i had to descend on this earth, due to a curse\npronounced on her by a Brahmin; and she chose the king Pururava as her\nhusband, thinking him to be endowed with all the qualities. She then addressed\nthe king and made the following contract :-- \xc2\x93O king, giving honour due to\nevery body! I keep these two young sheep in trust and deposit with you; kindly\nlook after these and, then, my honour will be preserved by you. O king! I will\ntake ghee daily and nothing else for my food; and there is one word more; O\nking! Let me not see you naked, except when you hold sexual intercourse. O\nking I say this truly, that, in case there be any breach in this contract I\nwill instantly leave you and go away.\xc2\x94 The king accepted this contract of\nUrvas\xc2\x92i. Urvas\xc2\x92i, too, remained there according to the above contract and also\nwith a view to pass away the period of her curse. During this time the king\nwas fascinated with the love of Urvas\xc2\x92i and became so very much attached to\nher, that he left all his duties and dharma and remained long for many, many\nyears in enjoying Urvas\xc2\x92i. The king's mind was so deeply absorbed in her, that\nhe could not remain alone without her,\n\n\n\np. 46\n\n\n\neven for a moment. Thus many years passed away, when, once on a time, Indra,\nthe lord of the Devas, not seeing Urvas'i, asked the Gandarbhas and said :--\n\xc2\x93O Gandarbhas! Better go and steal away the two young sheep in a proper time\nfrom the palace of Pururava, and then bring Urvas'i here. My Nandana garden is\nnow void of all beauty without Urvas\xc2\x92i; so bring the lady here any how or\nother.\xc2\x94 Thus spoken by Indra, Vis'vavasu and other Devas went to Pururava's\npalace; and when it was dark in the night, and when Pururava was holding\nsexual intercourse with Urvas\xc2\x92i, stole away the two young sheep. They, when\nbeing carried away in the sky, cried out so piteously that Urvas\xc2\x92i came to\nhear that as if of her two sons, and angrily spoke to the king :-- \xc2\x93O king!\nNow the contract that I made with you is verily fulfilled! It is that I placed\nmy implicit confidence on you that this my misfortune has befallen on me; See!\nthe thieves are stealing away the two sheep, my sons as they were! How then\nare you sleeping here like a woman? Alas! I am ruined in having an impotent\nhusband who vainly boasts of his prowess!\n\n\n\nWhere are my two young sheep to-day that are dearer to me than my life?\xc2\x94 Thus\nseeing Urvas\xc2\x92i wailing, the king Pururava, the lord of the Universe, ran after\nthe Gandharvas instantly without any sense as it were, left in him, naked. The\nGandharvas, then, cast rays of lightning in that room, and Urvas\xc2\x92i, willing to\nleave, saw the king naked when the Gandharvas left the two young sheep there\nand went away. The tired king brought the two sheep back to his house in that\nnaked state. Then Urvas\xc2\x92i, too, seeing the husband naked, went away\nimmediately to the Devi loka. Seeing Urvas\xc2\x92i going away, the king wailed very\nmuch with a very grievous heart. Then, being very much bewildered by the\nbereavement of Urvas\xc2\x92i, with his senses beyond control, and deluded by\npassion, wandered about in various countries, crying and giving vent to\nsorrow. Thus, wandering all over the globe, he came once to Kuruk _s_ ettra\nand saw Urvas\xc2\x92i; then with a gladdened face said :-- \xc2\x93O beloved! Wait, wait\nfor a moment; my mind is all absorbed in you; it is quite innocent and\nsubmissive to you. So you ought not to forsake me in such a dire difficult\ntime. O Devi! For the sake of you, I have travelled very far. O Beautiful one!\nThe body that you embraced before, will now, forsaken by you, fall here and\nwill be devoured by crows and wolves, and other carnivorous animals.\xc2\x94 Seeing\nthe king, tired and passion stricken, greatly distressed and with a very\nsorrowful heart and wailing, Urvas\xc2\x92i spoke out :-- \xc2\x93O king! You are certainly\na quite senseless man; whither has gone your extraordinary knowledge now? O\nking! Do you not know that the pure unalloyed love of women cannot take place\nwith any other as the love of a wolf cannot fall on any man. Therefore the\nearthly men ought never to trust a bit to women and thieves. So go\n\n\n\np. 47\n\n\n\nback to your palace and enjoy the pleasures of the kingdom; do not drown your\nmind further in sorrows.\xc2\x94 The king Pururava, though thus brought to senses by\nUrvas\xc2\x92i, was so much fascinated by her love that his heart did not feel any\nconsolation; rather he felt indescribable pain, being held up in bondage by\nthe love of Urvas\xc2\x92i. O Munis! Thus I have described to you the character of\nUrvas\xc2\x92i; it is described, in detail, in the Vedas; I have stated this in\nbrief.\n\n\n\nThus ends the thirteenth chapter of the 1st Skandha of the characters Urvas\xc2\x92i\nand Pururava; in the Mahapuranam S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 14](bk01ch14.htm)\n\n"
