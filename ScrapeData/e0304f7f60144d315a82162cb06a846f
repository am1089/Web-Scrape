D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n\xc2\xa7 22\\. God.--These two ideas, empiric servitude to Works and transcendental\nfreedom, leave little room for a Supreme God or moral guide of the experiences\nof souls. The older texts practically ignore such a power; their polytheistic\nmyths are merely echoes from the Veda, allegorically turned, and when they\nrefer to a supreme deity they mean the higher Self within man. Later authors,\nhowever, began occasionally to set up in theistic fashion a distinction\nbetween the Self within and the Self without. This finally led to the\nconception of the later Ved\xc4\x81nta, in which the Supreme Self, styled "the Lord"\n_( \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara)_, is given the function of directing as efficient cause the course\nof "works," so that each comes to its\n\np. 48\n\nrequital in due season and form, while the direct responsibility for all man\'s\nexperiences is thrown upon the inward Self. In other circles the same theistic\ncurrent led to the identification of this \xc4\x80tm\xc4\x81-God with one of the great\npopular deities, usually Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u or \xc5\x9aiva; and thus arose the great theologies,\nof which the most significant is the Bhagavad-g\xc4\xabt\xc4\x81, a compromise between\nUpanishadic idealism, S\xc4\x81nkhya physics, and practical faith. The first definite\ntheism is in Ka\xe1\xb9\xadh. II. 20 (?), 23, III. i., v. 13, Mu\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d. III. ii. 3, \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9ba 8,\n\xc5\x9avet. III 20, IV.-VI., etc. Worship of Brahma-\xc4\x80tm\xc4\x81 is however frequently\nmentioned in the Upanishads. It is an adoration of the Self either in its\nunqualified absoluteness (cf. Ch. III. xiv. 1, "Brahma in sooth is this All;\nit hath therein its beginning, end, and breath; so one should worship it in\nstillness"), or as allegorically typified by some physical force (see \xc2\xa7 5), or\nas represented by the sacred syllable _Om_ or _Aum,_ upon which see especially\nM\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d. and Pra. v., which sets forth the three degrees of reward for meditation\nupon one, two, or three elements of this word; cf. \xc5\x9aankara on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra, I.\niii. 13. See also \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8, 24.\n\n\xc5\x9aankara (on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra, II. iii. 29) claims that wherever the Vedas and\nUpanishads represent the absolute Brahma under the form of "determinations" (\xc2\xa7\n12), this is for the purpose of worship of Brahma as qualified Supreme, _sagu\n\xe1\xb9\x87a,_ e.g. in Ch. III. xiv. The conception of the soul\'s\n\np. 49\n\nrelation to God as that of a servant to his master is justified by him (on II.\niii. 43 f.), inasmuch as Brahma by his supreme "determinations" regulates the\nactivity of the empiric soul in the exercise of its inferior "determinations."\nHe permits the worship of this "qualified Brahma," i.e. the Absolute conceived\nunder the forms of empiric thought, but regards it as inferior in saving power\nto the true knowledge (see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 24, 25). The works of religion--ritual and\ndevotion--are of value only as aids to enlightenment; they are not necessary,\nand after enlightenment is gained they lose all significance (on III. iv. 25\nf., IV. i. 1 f.).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[47:1](brk24.htm#fr_2) _Predestination_ for empiric life, B.A. III. viii. 9,\nIV. iv. 5, Ch.
