(The Person) within the eye (is the highest Self) on account of\nsuitability.\n\nThe _Kh_ andogas have the following text: 'The Person that is seen within the\neye, that is the Self. This is the immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman' (\n_Kh_. Up. IV, 15, 1). The doubt here arises whether the person that is here\nspoken of as abiding within the eye is the reflected Self, or some divine\nbeing presiding over the sense of sight, or the embodied Self, or the highest\nSelf.--It is the reflected Self, the Purvapakshin maintains; for the text\nrefers to the person seen as something well known, and the expression, 'is\nseen,' clearly refers to something directly perceived. Or it may be the\nindividual soul, for that also may be referred to as something well known, as\nit is in special connexion with the eye: people, by looking into the open eye\nof a person, determine whether the living soul remains in him or is departing.\nOr else we may assume that the Person seen within the eye is some particular\ndivine being, on the strength of the scriptural text, B _ri_. Up. V, 5, 2, 'He\n(the person seen within the sun) rests with his rays in him (the person within\nthe eye).' Any of these beings may quite suitably be referred to as something\nwell known.--Of these alternatives the Sutra disposes by declaring that the\nPerson within the eye is the highest Self. For the text goes on to say about\nthe Person seen within the eye, 'They call him Sa _m_ yadvama, for all\nblessings go towards him. He is also Vamani, for he leads all blessings. He is\nalso Bhamani, for he shines in all worlds.' And all these attributes can be\nreconciled with the highest Self only.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 14.
