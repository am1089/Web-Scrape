The king said :-- What did the intelligent Brihaspati do after he had\nassumed falsely the appearance of S\xc2\x92ukracharya, and lived there as the\nspiritual guide of the Demons.\n\n\n\n2\\. O Muni! Brihaspati is the Guru of the Devas; he also devotes his time in\nstudying the Vedas; and is the ocean of all knowledge; he is the son of the\nMahar _s_ i Angira and he is himself a Muni. Endorsed with all these good\nqualifications, how could he deceive the Demons.\n\n\n\n3-4. In all the religious S\xc2\x92astras, Truth is declared to be the essence of\nDharma; and the Supreme Self is attained through Truth, so the wise sages say.\nHow can we expect an ordinary householder to be true when such a man as\nBrihaspati takes recourse to falsehood with the Demons.\n\n\n\n5\\. If one acquires, as one\xc2\x92s wealth, the whole Universe, still one does not\nrequire anything more than what is required in feeding one\xc2\x92s belly; how\n\n\n\np. 295\n\n\n\nis it that Brihaspati could speak falsehood merely for the sake of his belly?\n\n\n\n6\\. O Muni! The words sung by the ancient virtuous and respectable sages were\ntrue and had their corresponding objects denoted by those words; now they\nemployed the term S\xc2\x92i _st_ a meaning that there were virtuous, respectable\npersons as denoted by them. When Brihaspati can even commit such condemnable\ndeceitful acts and speak falsehood, we can expect no virtuous respectable\npersons in the world. Where then do you find the S\xc2\x92i _st_ a persons, denoted\nby the word S\xc2\x92i _st_ a, sung by the ancient sages? The word S\xc2\x92i _st_ a is now\nmeaningless!\n\n\n\n7\\. The Devas are sprung from the Sattvic qualities, men from Rajasic\nqualities and birds, etc. from the Tamasic qualities.\n\n\n\n8\\. When the Guru of the Immortals, the incarnate of Sattvic qualities, can\nbecome a liar, how can one expect those who are Rajasic or Tamasic to follow\nrigorously the truth?\n\n\n\n9\\. Oh! This Triloki is all pierced with falsehood! Where is the Religion! And\nwhat will be the ultimate goal of all these creatures!\n\n\n\n10\\. When Bhagavan Hari, Brahma, Indra and the best of the Devas when all can\nbetake to pretext, fraud and trickery and show cleverness in them; what to\nspeak of men!\n\n\n\n11-12. O Giver of honour! When all the Devas, Vas\xc2\x92is _t_ ha, Vamadeva,\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra, Brihaspati and other ascetic Munis get themselves overpowered by\nlust and anger, when their intelligence gets destroyed by covetousness and\navarice, when they are addicted to vices and are expert in fraud, pre-text and\ntrickery, then what fate, alas! can you expect of Dharma and what help is\nthere of any religious persons!\n\n\n\n13\\. Alas! lndra, Agni, Moon, and Brahma when these get overpowered by the\nstrong influence of lust, are in illicit love with others\xc2\x92 wives, where is the\ngoodness and virtuous behaviour in this Triloki?\n\n\n\n14\\. O Sinless One! To whom, then, can we look upon as our spiritual guide and\nour advice and law givers when all the Devas and Munis are corrupt with\navarice?\n\n\n\n15\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! Be he Indra, Brihaspati, Brahma, Vi _sn_ u or\nMahes\xc2\x92a, whoever is embodied or will put on bodies, he will have to be in\ntouch with the previously mentioned Ahamkara, and covetousness and other vices\ndue to name and form.\n\n\n\n16\\. O king! Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes\xc2\x92a are all attached to sensual\nobjects; and what improper and sinful actions there can be that cannot be\ncommitted by persons devoted to sensual objects!\n\n\n\np. 296\n\n\n\n17\\. It is through cleverness and fraud that any one devoted to sensual\nobjects can easily make oneself as cleverly free from Maya; but when\ndifficulty comes, then his trickery gets discovered and the respective\nqualities hidden in him are brought to bear their respective results. Know,\nthen, the three qualities to be conjointly the cause of all these actions; as\nwithout any cause, no action gets visible.\n\n\n\n18\\. These discrepancies in the case of Brahma and others are caused by the\nthree qualities; their bodies are all created from Pradhan Mahat and the other\n25 Tattvas (essences).\n\n\n\n19-20. O king! Brahma and others are subject to death; then how can you doubt\non other things? In advising others, everybody gives, as it were, good and\nvirtuous advices; but the burden falls upon their own heads; they fall off\nfrom their advices and act according to their hidden natures; then they yield\nto lust, anger, envy, egoism and fascination.\n\n\n\n21\\. No one who is embodied can get rid of passions, born of the 3 qualities.\nO king! Thus the Triloki goes, is the saying of the Mahar _s_ is.\n\n\n\n22-29. This Triloki, auspicious, inauspicious, mixed, never gets any serious\nchange; its nature remains always uniform. See Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u sometimes\npractises severe asceticism; Indra, the lord of the Devas sometimes follows\nthe practices of religious sacrifices. Again you find Vi _sn_ u Bhagavan, full\nof youth, fond of the Leela, enjoying the company of Rama in Vaikun _t_ ha;\nsometimes He is the ocean of mercy, is fighting dreadful battles with the\nDemons and being severely afflicted with their clusters of arrows; sometimes\nhe gains victories, sometimes he gets defeat through the irony of Fate; thus\nhe gets undoubtedly pleasures and pains. O king! some time Naraya _n_ a draws\nall the worlds into his belly and takes his yogic sleep on the thousand headed\nserpent S\xc2\x92es\xc2\x92a and again he gets himself awakened by Prakriti. O king! Brahma,\nVi _sn_ u, Mahes\xc2\x92a, Indra, the Devas, and Munis all of them, live up to the\nlimit of their ordained time and when the time of Pralaya, the Universal\ndissolution, ends, this whole Universe, moving and nonmoving, again comes into\nexistence as before; there is no doubt in this. O king, at the expiry of the\nordained time, Brahma and all others will die , no doubt.\n\n\n\n30-31. Again, in due course, Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, and Mahes\xc2\x92a and the other\nDevas come out and assume bodies and get all the passions, lust, etc., as\nordained. O King! You need not be astonished; this Triloki always goes on\naccompanied by lust, anger, etc.\n\n\n\n32-34. Persons free from lust, anger and other passions are very rare in this\nworld. He who is afraid of this world does not marry, and thus being free from\nthe attachments to any worldly object, becomes free and\n\n\n\np. 297\n\n\n\nroams fearless. The Moon stole away the wife of Brihaspati, and Brihaspati\nhimself stole away the wife of his younger brother. Thus in this wheel of\nSamsara, all the creatures are ever passioned with attachment, avarice, etc.\n\n\n\n35\\. The householder can never expect to obtain freedom. Therefore those who\nwant to be free, should carefully relinquish the idea of the stability of the\nworld and worship the Eternal Mother Full and Sat, Chit and \xc3\x82nandam.\n\n\n\n36\\. This world, moving and unmoving, O Mahes\xc2\x92ani, rolls in madness,\noverpowered by Her Maya.\n\n\n\n37\\. Intelligent persons worshipping Her, trample down the three qualities and\nbecome free. O king! No other Path exists for Freedom.\n\n\n\n38-39. Until one gets the Grace from the Mahes\xc2\x92ani, one never gets happiness.\nTrue mercy is not found anywhere else but from Her. Then one should worship\nthe All merciful, being of pure heart. For Her worship leads to freedom, even\nin this body-hood.\n\n\n\n40\\. He who getting a human frame fails to worship Mahes\xc2\x92ani, gets down from\nthe highest rung of the ladder. This is my opinion.\n\n\n\n41-42. This Universe, composed of the three qualities, is encompassed with\nAhamkara and fastened to untruth; therefore freedom can never be expected\nwithout the worship of That Potent Goddess, O Muni! O king! Renounce every\nworldly object and serve the Goddess Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari; this is the highest duty\nof all.\n\n\n\n43\\. The king said :-- What did, then, the Devaguru do in the disguise of\nS\xc2\x92ukracharya? And when did the real S\xc2\x92ukracharya come there? O respected Muni!\nSpeak on these points.\n\n\n\n44\\. Vyasa said :-- Please hear what the disguised Brihaspati in the shape of\nS\xc2\x92ukracharya did afterwards.\n\n\n\n45\\. The demons were made to understand clearly by Brihaspati; and then they\ntook him for S\xc2\x92ukracharya and placed implicit faith on him and began to think\nof him and him alone.\n\n\n\n46\\. The Daityas, enchanted and deceived by the magic of Brihaspati, took now\nhis refuge for acquiring the knowledge from him, since they mistook him for\nS\xc2\x92ukracharya. Who is there that is not enchanted by the idea of gaining\nsomething?\n\n\n\n47\\. On the other hand, when the term of ten years was over, S\xc2\x92ukracharya, the\nreal Guru of the Daityas, ceased enjoying Jayanti and began to remember his\ndisciples, the Daityas.\n\n\n\np. 298\n\n\n\n48\\. He now began to think that \xc2\x93My disciples, the Daityas, are expecting\nevery instant my return; and I would now go and see them, bewildered with\nfear.\n\n\n\n49-51. They are my devotees and I ought to do such that they might not be\nafraid of the Devas.\xc2\x94 And then he exclaimed to Jayanti, \xc2\x93O beautiful one! Let\nmy sons take the shelter of the Gods; your term of ten years is today over; I\nnow go therefore, to see my disciples; soon I will again come to you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n52\\. \xc2\x93Be it so\xc2\x94, replied Jayanti, the best of those who know religion, \xc2\x93you\ncan go where you like; I am not to destroy your Dharma.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n53-54. Hearing these words, S\xc2\x92ukracharya went hurriedly to the Demons and saw\nthe Devaguru Brihaspati sitting before them in the guise of S\xc2\x92ukracharya. He\nwas explaining to them the Jaina doctrines, compiled by himself and finding\nfault with the act of envy, taking revenge and killing and cursing the\nsacrifices, etc.\n\n\n\n55\\. He was telling them \xc2\x93O Enemies of Gods! Truly, I am telling you words\nthat will, no doubt, prove good to you. Non-killing is the highest virtue;\neven the enemies ought never to be killed.\n\n\n\n56\\. It is the Brahma _n_ as, addicted to enjoyments and pleasures of the\nsenses, who want to satisfy their tastes and pleasures that are found in the\nVeda\xc2\x92s injunctions to kill animals; but there is no virtue higher than non-\nkilling animals.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n57-58. O king! S\xc2\x92ukracharya was perfectly astonished to hear Brihaspati, the\nGuru of the Devas, speaking against the Vedas and began to think that\nBrihaspati is certainly my enemy. My disciples have been duped by this cheat;\nthere is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n59\\. Fie to Avarice! It is the seed of sin; very strong and the veritable gate\nto hell; Brihaspati, even, the Guru of the Devas, is speaking lies, bound\nunder the influence of this heinous avarice!\n\n\n\n60\\. Oh! What wonder is this that the Guru of the Devas, who is the\npromulgator of all the religious S\xc2\x92astras and whose word is accepted as the\nfinal decision, is now expounding the doctrines of atheists.\n\n\n\n61\\. When Brihaspati can become the expounder of atheistic doctrines, impelled\nby covetousness what to speak of those whose minds are not pure and whose\nintelligence is not sharp?\n\n\n\n62\\. This Deva Guru, though a Brahmi _n_ , is acting today like a rogue,\nwanting to take away all and is deceiving my disciples the Daityas, who have\nbeen confounded by his magic.\n\n\n\np. 299\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirteenth Chapter in the Fourth Book of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, the Mahapura _n_ am of 18,000 verses on cheating the Daityas by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 14](bk04ch14.htm)\n\n'
