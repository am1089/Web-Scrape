He must not cause a member of a twice-born caste to be carried out by a\n_S_ udra (even though he be a kinsman of the deceased);\n\n2\\. Nor a _S_ udra by a member of a twice-born caste.\n\n3\\. A father and a mother shall be carried out by their sons (who are equal in\ncaste to their parents).\n\n4\\. But _S_ udras must never carry out a member of a twice-born caste, even\nthough he be their father.\n\n5\\. Those Brahma _n_ as who carry out (or follow the corpse of) a (deceased)\nBrahma _n_ a who has no relatives shall attain a mansion in heaven.\n\n6\\. Those who have carried out a dead relative and burnt his corpse, shall\nwalk round the pile from left to right, and then plunge into water, dressed in\ntheir clothes.\n\n7\\. After having offered a libation of water to the deceased, they must place\none ball of rice on blades of Kusa grass, (and this ceremony has to be\nrepeated on each subsequent day, while the period of impurity lasts.)\n\n8\\.

Then they must throw unbroken grains into the fire.\n\n10\\. On the fourth day they must collect the bones that have been left.\n\n11\\. And they must throw them into water from the Ganges.\n\n12\\. As many bones of a man are contained in the water of the Ganges, so many\nthousands of years will he reside in heaven.\n\n13\\. While the term of impurity lasts, they must continually offer a libation\nof water and a ball of rice to the deceased.\n\n14\\. And they must eat food which has been bought, or which they have received\nunsolicited.\n\n15\\. And they, must eat no meat.\n\n16\\. And they must sleep on the ground.\n\n17\\. And they must sleep apart.\n\n18\\. When the impurity is over, they must walk forth from the village, have\ntheir beards shaved, and having cleansed themselves with a paste of sesamum,\nor with a paste of mustard-seed, they must change their dress and re-enter the\nhouse.\n\n19\\.

The particle _k_ a, according to Nand., indicates that factitious salt\nmust also not be used by them, as stated in a Sm _ri_ ti.\n\n15\\.

The gods are invisible deities, the Brahma _n_ as are visible deities.\n\n21\\. The Brahma _n_ as sustain the world.\n\n22\\. It is by the favour of the Brahma _n_ as that the gods reside in heaven;\na speech uttered by Brahma _n_ as (whether a curse or a benediction) never\nfails to come true.\n\n23\\. What the Brahma _n_ as pronounce, when highly pleased (as, if they\npromise sons, cattle, wealth, or some other boon to a man), the gods will\nratify; when the visible gods are pleased, the invisible gods are surely\npleased as well.\n\n24\\. The mourners, who lament the loss of a relative, shall be addressed by\nmen gifted with a tranquil frame of mind with such consolatory speeches as I\nshall now recite to thee, O Earth, who art cherished to my, mind.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XX.](sbe07022.htm)\n\n'
