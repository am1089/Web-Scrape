 \nThe heavenly chorister, and saint,  \nAnd spirit pure from earthly taint,  \nWith one accord had sought the place  \nThe high-souled monarch's rite to grace.  \nThen to the Gods who came to take  \nTheir proper share the hermit spake:  \n'For you has Das'aratha slain  \nThe votive steed, a son to gain;  \nStern penance-rites the king has tried,  \nAnd in firm faith on you relied,  \n\nAnd now with undiminished care  \nA second rite would fain prepare.  \nBut, O ye Gods, consent to grant  \nThe longing of your supplicant.  \nFor him beseeching hands I lift,  \nAnd pray you all to grant the gift,  \nThat four fair sons of high renown  \nThe offerings of the king may crown.'  \nThey to the hermit's son replied:  \n'His longing shall be gratified.  \nFor, Brahman, in most high degree  \nWe love the king and honour thee.'  \n\nThese words the Gods in answer said,  \nAnd vanished thence by Indra led.  \nThus to the Lord, the worlds who made,  \nThe Immortals all assembled prayed:  \n'O Brahma, mighty by thy grace,  \nRavan, who rules the giant race,  \nTorments us in his senseless pride,  \nAnd penance-loving saints beside.  \nFor thou well pleased in days of old  \nGavest the boon that makes him bold,  \nThat God nor demon e'er should kill  \nHis charmed life, for so thy will.  \nWe, honouring that high behest,  \nBear all his rage though sore distressed.  \nThat lord of giants fierce and fell  \nScourges the earth and heaven and hell.  \nMad with thy boon, his impious rage  \nSmites saint and bard and God and sage.  \nThe sun himself withholds his glow.  \nThe wind in fear forbears to blow;  \nThe fire restrains his wonted heat  \nWhere stand the dreaded Ravan's feet,  \nAnd, necklaced with the wandering ware,  \nThe sea before him fears to rave.  \nKuvera's self in sad defeat  \nIs driven from his blissful seat.  \nWe see, we feel the giant's might.  \nAnd woe comes o'er us and affright.  \nTc thee, O Lord, thy suppliants pray  \nTo find some cure this plague to stay.'  \n\nThus by the gathered Gods addressed  \nHe pondered in his secret breast,  \nAnd said: 'One only way I find  \nTo slay this fiend of evil mind.  \nHe prayed me once his life to guard  \nFrom demon, God, and heavenly bard,  \nAnd spirits of the earth and air,  \nAnd I consenting heard his prayer.  \nBut the proud giant in Inn scorn  \nRecked not of man of woman born.  \nNone else may take his life away,  \nBut only man the fiend may slay.'  \nThe Gods, with Indra at their head,  \nRejoiced to hear the words he said.  \nThen crowned with glory like a flame,  \nLord Vishnu to the council came;  \nHis hands shell, mace, and discus bore,  \nAud saffron were the robes he wore.  \n\np. 26  \n\nRiding his eagle through the crowd,  \nAs the sun rides upon a cloud,  \nWith bracelets of fine gold, he came  \nLoud welcomed by the Gods' acclaim.  \nHis praise they sang with one consent,  \nAnd cried, in lowly reverence bent:  \n'O Lord whose hand fierce Madhu 1 slew,  \nBe thou our refuge, firm and true;  \nFriend of the suffering worlds art thou,  \nWe pray thee help thy suppliants now.'  \nThen Vishnu spake: 'Ye Gods, declare,  \nWhat may I do to grant your prayer?'  \n\n'King Das'aratha,' thus cried they,  \n'Fervent in penance many a day,  \nThe sacrificial steed has slain,  \nLonging for sons, but all in vain.  \nNow, at the cry of us forlorn,  \nIncarnate as his seed be born.  \nThree queens has he: each lovely dame  \nLike Beauty, Modesty, or Fame.  \nDivide thyself in four, and be  \nHis offspring by these noble three.  \nMan's nature take, and slay in fight  \nRavan who laughs at heavenly might:  \nThis common scourge, this rankling thorn  \nWhom the three worlds too long have borne.  \nFor Ravan in the senseless pride  \nOf might unequalled has defied  \nThe host of heaven, and plagues with woe  \nAngel and bard and saint below,  \nCrushing each spirit and each maid  \nWho plays in Nandan's 2 heavenly shade.  \nO conquering Lord, to thee we bow;  \nOur surest hope and trust art thou.  \nRegard the world of men below,  \nAnd slay the Gods' tremendous foe.'  \n\nWhen thus the suppliant Gods had prayed,  \nHis wise reply Narayan 3 made:  \n'What task demands my presence there,  \nAnd whence this dread, ye Gods declare.'  \n\nThe Gods replied: 'We fear, O Lord,  \nFierce Ravan, ravener abhorred.  \nBe thine the glorious task, we pray,  \nIn human form this fiend to slay.  \nBy thee of all the Blest alone  \nThis sinner may be overthrown.  \nHe gained by penance long and dire  \nThe favour of the mighty Sire.  \nThen He who every gift bestows  \n\nGuarded the fiend from heavenly foes,  \nAnd gave a pledge his life that kept  \nFrom all things living, man except.  \nOn him thus armed no other foe  \nThan man may deal the deadly blow.  \nAssume, O King, a mortal birth,  \nAnd strike the demon to the earth.'  \n\nThen Vishnu, God of Gods, the Lord  \nSupreme by all the worlds adored,  \nTo Brahma and the suppliants spake:  \n'Dismiss your fear: for your dear sake  \nIn battle will I smite him dead,  \nThe cruel fiend, the Immortal's dread,  \nAnd lords and ministers and all  \nHis kith and kin with him shall fall.  \nThen, in the world of mortal men,  \nTen thousand years and hundreds ten  \nI as a human king will reign,  \nAnd guard the earth as my domain.'  \n\nGod, saint, aud nymph, and ministrel throng  \nWith heavenly voices raised their song  \nIn hymns of triumph to the God  \nWhose conquering feet on Madhu trod:  \n   'Champion of Gods, as man appear,  \n     This cruel Ravan slay,  \n   The thorn that saints and hermits fear,  \n     The plague that none can stay.  \n   In savage fury uncontrolled  \n     His pride for ever grows:  \n   He dares the Lord of Gods to hold  \n     Among his deadly foes.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[25:1](ry016.htm#fr_104) The Maruts are the winds, deified in we religion of\nthe Veda like other mighty Powers and phenomena of nature.\n\n[26:1](ry016.htm#fr_105) A Titan or fiend whose destruction has given Vishnu\none of his well-known titles, Madhava.\n\n[26:2](ry016.htm#fr_106) The garden of Indra.\n\n[26:3](ry016.htm#fr_107) One of the most ancient and popular of the numerous\nnames of Vishnu.
