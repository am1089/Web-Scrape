THE ANSWER.\n\n1. 1 When the plaint has been well defined, a clear exposition given of what is claimed and what not, and the meaning of the plaint fully established, (the\n\np. 293\n\njudge) shall then cause the answer to be written (by the defendant).\n\n2. 2 If the defendant does not make an answer fully meeting the contents of the plaint, he shall be compelled to pay by gentle remonstrances, and the other (two) methods (to be indicated directly).\n\n3\\. Kindly speeches are gentle remonstrances; intimidation is pointing out\ndangers; force consists of depriving one of his property, or striking, or\nbinding him.\n\n4\\. When a man makes no answer, though both (mild and harsh methods) have been\nadopted against him, he is defeated, and liable to punishment after the lapse\nof a week.\n\n5. 5 When the defendant asks for a delay through (natural) timidity, or terror, or because his memory has been deranged, the delay shall be granted to him.\n\n6\\. He should be allowed (a delay extending to) one day, or three days, or\nfive days, or seven days, or a fortnight, or a month, or three seasons\n(equalling six months), or a year, according to his ability.\n\n7. 7 The insane and intoxicated, those abandoned by their relatives or friends, those charged with a heavy crime, idiots, persons cast off from society, and infants, should be considered unable to deliver an answer.\n\n8. 8 One should not cause to be written an answer\n\np. 294\n\nwhich wanders from the subject, or which is not to the point, too confined or\ntoo extensive, or not in conformity with the plaint, or not thorough enough,\nor absurd, or ambiguous.\n\n9. 9 If (the defendant) confesses, he shall state his confession; in the case of a denial, he shall cause (his denial) to be written; and so (should he record) his special plea in an answer by special plea, and his previous victory in an answer by previous victory.\n\n10\\. A denial called forth by fear (of punishment) is contemptible in the eyes\nof men familiar with law; a true confession is declared to be meritorious.\n\n11\\. In a plea by victory in a former trial, a true statement is praised by\nthe virtuous; a false one is sinful and causes the defeat of the defendant.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[292:1](sbe3362.htm#fr_905) IV, 1.
