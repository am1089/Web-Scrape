If it be said that this is not so, on account of direct teaching; we\nreply not so, on account of the texts declaring that which abides within the\nspheres of those entrusted with special functions.\n\nBut, an objection is raised, certain texts directly declare that the released\nsoul also possesses 'world-energy.' Compare 'He becomes a self-ruler; he moves\nin all worlds according to his wishes ' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 25, 2); 'He moves\nthrough these worlds, enjoying any food he wishes, and assuming any shape he\nwishes' (Taitt. Up. III, 10, 5). We cannot therefore accept the restriction\nlaid down in the last Sutra.--Not so, the latter half of the present Sutra\ndeclares, 'on account of the texts declaring that which abides in the spheres\nof those entrusted with special functions.' The meaning of the texts quoted is\nthat the\n\np. 768\n\nreleased soul participates in the enjoyments connected with the spheres of\nHira _n_ yagarbha and other beings which are entrusted with special functions.\nThe soul whose knowledge is no longer obstructed by Karman freely enjoys all\nthe different worlds in which the power of Brahman manifests itself and thus\nis fully satisfied.--But if the released soul, no less than the soul\nimplicated in the Sa _m_ sara, experiences enjoyments belonging to the sphere\nof change, it follows that the sum of its enjoyments is finite and limited,\nand that hence the released soul is no better off than the soul in the state\nof bondage!--Of this doubt the next Sutra disposes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 19.
