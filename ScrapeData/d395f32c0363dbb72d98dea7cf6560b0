But (Brahman is) additional, on account of the declaration of difference.\n\nThe word 'but' sets aside the prima facie view. To the individual soul capable\nof connexion with the various kinds of pain there is additional, i.e. from it\nthere is different, Brahman.--On what ground?--'Owing to the declaration of\ndifference.' For Brahman is spoken of as different from the soul in the\nfollowing texts:--'He who dwells in the Self and within the Self, whom the\nSelf does not know, of whom the Self is the body, who rules the Self within,\nhe is thy Self, the ruler within, the immortal' (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 22);\n'Knowing as separate the Self and the Mover, blessed by him he gains\nImmortality' ( _S_ vet. Up. I, 6); 'He is the cause, the Lord of the lords of\nthe organs' (i.e. the individual souls) ( _S_ vet Up. VI, 9); 'One of them\neats the sweet fruit; without eating the other looks on' ( _S_ vet. Up.\n\np. 469\n\n[paragraph continues] IV, 6); 'There are two, the one knowing, the other not\nknowing, both unborn, the one a ruler, the other not a ruler' ( _S_ vet. Up.\nI, 9); 'Embraced by the pra _g \xc3\xb1_a. Self (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 21); 'Mounted by\nthe pra _g \xc3\xb1_a. Self' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 35); 'From that the ruler of maya\nsends forth all this, in that the other is bound up through maya ( _S_ vet.\nUp. IV, 9); 'the Master of the Pradhana and the souls, the lord of the gu _n_\nas' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 16);'the eternal among eternals, the intelligent among\nthe intelligent, who, one, fulfils the desires of many' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI,\n13); 'who moves within the Unevolved, of whom the Unevolved is the body, whom\nthe Unevolved does not know; who moves within the Imperishable, of whom the\nImperishable is the body, whom the Imperishable does not know; who moves\nwithin Death, of whom Death is the body, whom Death does not know; he is the\ninner Self of all beings, free from evil, the divine one, the one God, Naraya\n_n_ a'; and other similar texts.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 23.
