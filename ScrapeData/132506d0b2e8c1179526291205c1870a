Would they dare to call the full moon dirty because it has smudged its\nface with ink?\n\nFor every little trifle they blame you, my child. They are ready to find fault\nfor nothing.\n\nYou tore your clothes while playing--is that why they call you untidy?\n\nO, fie! What would they call an autumn morning that smiles through its ragged\nclouds?\n\nTake no heed of what they say to you, my child.\n\nTake no heed of what they say to you, my child.\n\nThey make a long list of your misdeeds.
