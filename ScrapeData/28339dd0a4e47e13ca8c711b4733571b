With reverence I shall worship thee who art long-tailed like a horse,\nAgni, the king of worship.\n\n2\\. May he, our son of strength [1](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:2:1), proceeding on\nhis broad way, the propitious, become bountiful to us.\n\n3\\. Thus protect us always, thou who hast a full life, from the mortal who\nseeks to do us harm [1](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:3:1), whether near or afar.\n\n4\\. And mayest thou, O Agni, announce to the gods this our newest efficient\nGayatra song.\n\n5\\. Let us partake of all booty that is highest and that is middle (i. e. that\ndwells in the highest and in the middle world); help us to the wealth that is\nnearest.\n\n6\\. O god with bright splendour, thou art the distributor. Thou instantly\nflowest for the liberal giver in the wave of the river, near at hand.\n\nB.\n\n7\\. The mortal, O Agni, whom thou protectest in battles, whom thou speedest in\nthe races [1](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:7:1), he will command constant nourishment:\n\n8\\. Whosoever he may be, no one will overtake him, O conqueror (Agni)! His\nstrength [2](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:8:2) is glorious.\n\n9\\. May he (the man), known among all tribes [3](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:9:3),\nwin the race with his horses; may he with the help of his priests become a\ngainer.\n\np. 17\n\nC.\n\n10\\. O _G_ arabodha [1](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:10:1)! Accomplish this (task) for\nevery house [2](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:10:2): a beautiful song of praise for\nworshipful Rudra [3](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:10:3).\n\n11\\. May he, the great, the immeasurable, the smoke-bannered, rich in\nsplendour, incite us to (pious) thoughts and to strength.\n\n12\\. May he hear us, like the rich lord of a clan, the banner of the gods, on\nbehalf of our hymns, Agni with bright light.\n\n13\\. Reverence to the great ones, reverence to the lesser ones! Reverence to\nthe young, reverence to the old [1](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:13:1)! Let us\nsacrifice to the gods, if we can. May I not, O gods, fall as a victim to the\ncurse of my better [2](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:13:2).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe hymn is ascribed to _S_ una _h_ _s_ epa (see note on I, 26). The metre is\nGayatri; the last verse is Trish _t_ ubh.\n\nThe laws of arrangement of the Sa _m_ hita show that this hymn, which has\nthirteen verses and follows after a hymn of ten verses belonging to the same\ndeity, must be divided into a number of minor hymns. On the question of this\ndivision some further light is thrown by the metre. The first six verses and\nthen again the verses 10-12 are composed in the trochaic form of the Gayatri\nmetre; of the verses 7-9, on the other hand, not a single Pada shows the\ncharacteristics of that metre. I believe, therefore, that the verses 1-6 form\none hymn by themselves, or possibly two hymns of three verses each. Then\nfollow two hymns: verses 7-9, 10-12\\. As to verse 13, which is composed in a\ndifferent metre, it is difficult to determine its exact nature. It may be a\nlater addition: though in that case\n\np. 18\n\nwe shall hardly be able to explain why it was placed at the end of the hymns\naddressed to Agni, to which god it contains no reference whatever. Or it may\nform part of the hymn 10-12: in that case we should have to consider this\nwhole hymn, which would then violate the rules of arrangement, as an addition\nto the original collection.\n\nWe may add that the Sama-veda gives the first twelve verses of this Sukta so\nas to form four independent hymns: 1-3 = SV. II, 984-6; 4. 6. 5 = SV. II,\n847-9; 7-9 = SV. II, 765-7; 10-12 = SV. II, 1013-15\\. Besides, verse 1 is\nfound in SV. I, 17. Verse 4 = SV. I, 28; T\xc3\x82r. IV, 11, 8. Verse 7 = VS. VI, 29;\nTS. I, 3, 13, 2; MS. I, 3, 1. Verse 10 = SV. I, 15. Comp. Bergaigne,\nRecherches sur l\'histoire de la Sa _m_ hita, II, pp. 7-8; H. O., Prolegomena,\n225-226.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. It requires a stronger belief in the infallibility of Vedic text\ntradition than I possess, not to change _s_ avasa into _s_ avasa _h_. I do not\nthink that I, 62, 9 (sanemi sakhyam svapasyamana _h_ sunu _h_ dadhara _s_\navasa suda _m_ sa _h_ ) furnishes a sufficient argument against this\nconjecture.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Grassmann reads aghaayo _h_ for the sake of the metre; Prof. Max\nMuller proposes a\xcc\x86ghayo\xcc\x86 _h_. I think that the missing syllable should be\ngained by disyllabic pronunciation of -at in martyat or rather martiat. Comp.\nmy Prolegomena 185 and the quotations given there in note 1.\n\n### Verses 7-9.\n\nNote 1. It is not my intention to enter here into a new discussion on so\nfrequently discussed a word as va _g_ a. I have translated it in verses 7, 9\nby \'race,\' in verse 8 by \'strength.\'\n\nNote 2. The expression used in verses 7 and 8 should be compared especially\nwith VII, 40, 3. sa _h_ it ugra _h_ astu maruta _h_ sa _h_ _s_ ushmi\xc2\xb4 yam\nmartyam p _ri_ shada _s_ va _h_ avatha, uta im agni _h_ sarasvati _g_ unanti\nna tasya raya _h_ paryeta\xc2\xb4 asti.\n\np. 19\n\nNote 3. Vi _s_ va _k_ arsha _n_ i, a frequent epithet of Agni, here refers to\nthe mortal hero protected by Agni; comp. I, 64, 14 (vol. xxxii, p. 108); X,\n93, 10 (vi _s_ va _k_ arsha _n_ i _s_ rava _h_ ).\n\n### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. I think that Ludwig is right in taking _G_ arabodha for a proper name.\n\nNote 2. Vi _s_ e-vi _s_ e may possibly depend on ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iyaya, so that we\nshould have to translate: \'Administer this task: a beautiful song of praise to\nRudra who is worshipful for every house.\'\n\nNote 3. Rudra is here a designation of Agni, as the next verses show. Comp.\nPischel-Geldner, I, 56.\n\n### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. The word a _s_ ina, \'old,\' occurring only here, is doubtful. In III,\n1, 6; IV, 33, 3; X, 39, 4, sana or sanaya stands in contrast with yuvan. Shall\nwe conjecture nama _h_ a\xc2\xb4 sanebhya _h_?\'\n\nNote 2. The last Pada of this verse, ma\xc2\xb4 _g_ ya\xc2\xb4yasa _h_ _s_ amsam a\xc2\xb4 v _ri_\nkshi deva _h_ (\'May I not, O gods, neglect the praise of the greatest,\' Muir,\nV, 12), offers some difficulty. It may be doubted whether a\xc2\xb4 v _ri_ kshi\nbelongs to a-v _ri_ _g_ or to a-vra _s_ _k_.\n\nLet us see what would be the meaning of the passage, if we were to decide for\na-v _ri_ _g_. VIII, 101, 16 the cow speaks: devi\xc2\xb4m devebhya _h_ pari eyushim\nga\xc2\xb4m a\xc2\xb4 ma av _ri_ kta martya _h_ dabhra _k_ eta _h_ , \'Me the goddess, the\ncow, who has come hither from the gods, the weak-minded mortal has\nappropriated.\' _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a XIV, 9, 4, 3. ya eva _m_ vidvan\nadhopahasa _m_ _k_ araty a sa stri _n_ a _m_ suk _ri_ ta _m_ v _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85kte \xe0\xa4\xbd tha\nya idam avidvan adhopahasa _m_ _k_ araty asya striya _h_ suk _ri_ ta _m_ v\n_ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ate, \'He who knowing this, &c., appropriates the good works of\nthe women. But the women appropriate the good works of him who without knowing\nthis,\' &c. In Rig-veda X, 159, 5 also we probably have a form of a-v _ri_ _g_.\nThere we find the triumphant utterance\n\np. 20\n\nof a wife who has gained superiority over her fellow-wives: a av _ri_ ksham\nanyasam var _k_ a _h_ , \'I have won for myself the splendour of the other\nwives.\' We may conclude from these passages that our Pada, if a\xc2\xb4 v _ri_ kshi\nis derived from a-v _ri_ _g_ , would mean: \'May I not draw on myself the curse\nof my better.\'\n\nOn the other hand we have a great number of passages--they have been collected\nby Ludwig, IV, 249 seq.--in which the verb a-vra _s_ _k_ appears. Referring\nthe reader for fuller information to Ludwig, I content myself here with\nselecting one or two of these passages. Taitt. Sa _m_ h. II, 4, 11, 4.\ndevatabhyo va esha a v _ri_ _s_ _k_ yate yo yakshya ity uktva na ya _g_ ate.\nIn translating this we should remember that vra _s_ _k_ means \'to cut down;\'\na-vra _s_ _k_ , therefore, must be \'to cut down so that the object reaches a\ncertain destination.\' I translate therefore: \'He who says, "I shall\nsacrifice," and does not sacrifice, is cut down for the deities,\'--i. e. he is\ndedicated or forfeited to the deities and is thus destroyed (comp. a different\nexplanation of a-vra _s_ _k_ by Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, 143). In other\npassages not the dative but the locative is used for indicating the being to\nwhom somebody is forfeited; see Atharva-veda XII, 4, 6. 12. 26; XV, 12, 6. 10.\n\nA Rig-vedic passage containing a-vra _s_ _k_ (with the dative) is X, 87, 18.\na\xc2\xb4 v _ri_ _s_ _k_ yantam aditaye dureva _h_ , \'May the evil-doers be forfeited\nto Aditi.\'\n\nSeveral times we find the first person aor. med. in the same form as in our\npassage, a v _ri_ kshi; see, for instance, the Nivid formula to the Vi _s_ ve\ndeva _h_ , _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana _S_ rautasutra VIII, 21. In this Nivid, the text of\nwhich as given by Hillebrandt is not quite identical with that of Ludwig, we\nread according to Hillebrandt\'s edition: ma vo deva avi _s_ asa ma vi _s_\nasayur a v _ri_ kshi. This ma \xe2\x80\xa6 a v _ri_ kshi looks quite similar to our\npassage. The same may be said of Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita I, 6, 6, 1. yat te\ntapas tasmai te mav _ri_ kshi. Considering such passages it is difficult not\nto believe that it is the verb a vra _s_ _k_ which we have before us in our\nverse. It must be admitted indeed that the accusative\n\np. 21\n\n_s_ a _m_ sam does not agree with the construction of the later Vedic\npassages. Can the accusative stand in the ancient language of the Rig-veda in\nthe same connection in which we have found the dative and the locative? So\nthat a-vra _s_ _k_ (in the middle or passive) with the accusative would mean:\nto be cut down in the direction towards another being, i. e. being forfeited\nto that being? In that case the translation of our passage would be: \'May I\nnot, O gods, fall as a victim to the praise (or rather, to the curse) of my\nbetter.\' If this explanation of the accusative is thought too bold, we should\npropose to correct the text so as to get a dative or, which would suit the\nmetre better, a locative: ma\xc2\xb4 _g_ ya\xc2\xb4yasa _h_ _s_ a _m_ saya (or _s_ a _m_ se)\na\xc2\xb4 v _ri_ kshi deva _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 31](sbe46008.htm)\n\n'
