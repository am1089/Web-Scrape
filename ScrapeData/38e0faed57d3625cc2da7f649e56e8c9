Ravan's own dwelling seems to have been situated\nwithin the enchanted chariot Pushpak: but the description is involved and\nconfused, and it is difficult to say whether the chariot was inside the palace\nor the palace inside the chariot.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto VIII.: The Enchanted Car.](ry350.htm)\n\n"
