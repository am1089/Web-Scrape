If it be said that (Brahman is devoid of powers) on account of the\nabsence of organs; (we reply that) this has been explained (before).\n\nLet this be granted.--Scripture, however, declares the highest divinity to be\nwithout (bodily) organs of action 1; so, for instance, in the passage, 'It is\nwithout eyes, without ears, without speech, without mind' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8,\n8). Being such, how should it be able to produce effects, although it may be\nendowed with all powers? For we know (from mantras, arthavadas, &c.) that the\ngods and other intelligent beings, though endowed with all powers, are capable\nof producing certain effects only because they are furnished with bodily\ninstruments of action. And, moreover, how can the divinity, to whom the\nscriptural passage, 'No, no,' denies all attributes, be endowed with all\npowers?\n\nThe appropriate reply to this question has been already given above. The\ntranscendent highest Brahman can be fathomed by means of Scripture only, not\nby mere reasoning. Nor are we obliged to assume that the capacity of one being\nis exactly like that which is observed in another. It has likewise been\nexplained above that although all qualities are denied of Brahman we\nnevertheless may consider it to be endowed with powers, if we assume in its\nnature an element of plurality, which is the mere figment of Nescience.\nMoreover, a scriptural passage ('Grasping without hands, hastening without\nfeet, he sees without eyes, he hears without ears' _S_ ve. Up. III, 19)\ndeclares that Brahman\n\np. 356\n\nalthough devoid of bodily organs, possesses all possible capacities.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[355:1](sbe34170.htm#fr_313) The Sutra is concerned with the body only as far\nas it is an instrument; the case of extraneous instruments having already been\ndisposed of in Sutra 24.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 32](sbe34171.htm)\n\n"
