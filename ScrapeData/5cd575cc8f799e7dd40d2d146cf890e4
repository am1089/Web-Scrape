But as the Self; this (the ancient Devotees) acknowledge (since the texts)\nmake (them) apprehend (in that way).\n\np. 717\n\nThe following point is now taken into consideration. Is Brahman to be\nmeditated upon as something different from the meditating Devotee, or as the\nSelf of the latter?--The Purvapakshin holds the former view. For, he says, the\nindividual soul is something different from Brahman; as has been proved under\nII, 1, 22; III, 4, 8; I, 1, 15. And Brahman must be meditated upon as it truly\nis; for if it is meditated upon under an unreal aspect, the attaining to\nBrahman also will not be real, according to the principle expressed in the\ntext, \'According as a man\'s thought is in this world, so will he be when he\nhas departed this life\' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 1). This view the Sutra sets\naside. Brahman is rather to be meditated upon as being the Self of the\nmeditating Devotee. As the meditating individual soul is the Self of its own\nbody, so the highest Brahman is the Self of the individual soul--this is the\nproper form of meditation.--Why? Because the great Devotees of olden times\nacknowledged this to be the true nature of meditation; compare the text \'Then\nI am indeed thou, holy divinity, and thou art me.\'--But how can the Devotees\nclaim that Brahman which is a different being is their \'Ego\'?--Because the\ntexts enable them to apprehend this relation as one free from contradiction.\n\'He who dwelling within the Self is different from the Self, whom the Self\ndoes not know, of whom the Self is the body, who rules the Self from within;\nhe is thy Self, the inner ruler, the immortal one\'(B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 3); \'In\nthe True all these beings have their root, they dwell in the True, they rest\nin the True;--in that all that exists has its Self\' (Kh. Up. VI, 8); \'All this\nindeed is Brahman\' (Kh. Up. III, 14, 1)--all these texts teach that all\nsentient and non-sentient beings spring from Brahman, are merged in him,\nbreathe through him, are ruled by him, constitute his body; so that he is the\nSelf of all of them. In the same way therefore as, on the basis of the fact\nthat the individual soul occupies with regard to the body the position of a\nSelf, we form such judgments of co-ordination as \'I am a god--I am a man\'; the\nfact of the individual Self being of the nature of Self justifies us in\nviewing our own Ego as belonging\n\np. 718\n\nto the highest Self. On the presupposition of all ideas being finally based on\nBrahman and hence all words also finally denoting Brahman, the texts therefore\nmake such statements of mutual implication as \'I am thou, O holy divinity, and\nthou art me.\' On this view of the relation of individual soul and highest Self\nthere is no real contradiction between two, apparently contradictory, sets of\ntexts, viz. those on the one hand which negative the view of the soul being\ndifferent from the highest Self, \'Now if a man meditates upon another\ndivinity, thinking "the divinity is one and I another," he does not know\'; \'He\nis incomplete, let him meditate upon Him as the Self\'; \'Everything abandons\nhim who views anything apart from the Self (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10; 7-II, 4, 6);\nand on the other hand those texts which set forth the view of the soul and the\nhighest Self being different entities, \'Thinking of the (individual) Self and\nthe Mover as different\'( _S_ vet. Up. I, 6). For our view implies a denial of\ndifference in so far as the individual \'I\' is of the nature of the Self; and\nit implies an acknowledgment of difference in so far as it allows the highest\nSelf to differ from the individual soul in the same way as the latter differs\nfrom its body. The clause \'he is incomplete\' (in one of the texts quoted\nabove) refers to the fact that Brahman which is different from the soul\nconstitutes the Self of the soul, while the soul constitutes the body of\nBrahman.--It thus remains a settled conclusion that Brahman is to be meditated\nupon as constituting the Self of the meditating Devotee.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of \'meditation under the aspect of Self.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
