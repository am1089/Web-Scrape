Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said: I have heard from you, O Ocean of compassion, about the\ntransmigrating of the individual, through ignorance, in the worlds of change.\nI now wish to hear about the means for eternal liberation.\n\nO Lord, O Ruler of the Shining Ones, compassionate to those who seek refuge,--\nin this terrible world of change, in the unsubstantial, in all deep miseries,\n\nThe endless multitudes of individuals, placed in various kinds of bodies, are\nborn and die--of them no end is known.\n\nAlways miserable in this world, no one is ever known to be happy. O Lord of\nLiberation, tell me by what means they may obtain release, O Lord.\n\n5-7. The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, and I will explain to you what\nyou have asked, even by the hearing of which a man is released from the world\nof change.\n\nThere is a Shining One, \xc5\x9aiva, who has the nature of Supreme Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87, who is\npartless, all-knowing, all-doing, Lord of all, stainless and secondless,\n\np. 155\n\nSelf-illumined, beginningless and endless, beyond the Beyond, without\nattributes, Being and Knowing and Bliss. That which is considered the\nindividual is from a part of Him.\n\n8-10 These, like sparks of a fire, with beginningless ignorance, separated and\nencased in bodies by beginningless karma,\n\nAre fettered by forms of good and evil, giving happiness and misery,--with\nnationality of body, length of life, and fortune born of karma.\n\nIn every life obtained. They have also, O Bird, a higher and more subtle body,\nthe _li \xe1\xb9\x85ga_, lasting until liberation.\n\n11-13. The unmoving things, worms, goats, birds, animals, men, the righteous,\nthe thirty-three deities, and also the liberated, according to their order,\n\nHaving worn and cast aside the four sorts of bodies thousands of times, one\nbecomes a man by good deeds, and if he becomes a knower 1 he attains\nliberation.\n\nThe embodied, in the eighty-four hundred thousands of bodies before attaining\nhuman birth, can obtain no knowledge of the truth.\n\n14-16. Through millions of myriads of thousands of births some time a being\nobtains human birth, through the accumulation of merit.\n\np. 156\n\nHe who, having obtained a human body, difficult to get, and a step to\nliberation, does not help himself over,--who in this world is more sinful than\nhe?\n\nThe man who, having obtained this highest birth and superior senses, does not\nunderstand what benefits the soul is a slayer of Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87.\n\n17-19. Without a body, nobody obtains the object of human life; therefore\nshould he guard his body as wealth and perform meritorious deeds.\n\nHe should always guard his body, which is the means to everything. Living, he\nshould make every effort to protect it, in view of welfare.\n\nA village again, a field again, wealth again, a house again, good and evil\nactions again--the body never again. 1\n\n20-21. The wise always adopt means for the preservation of the body; even\nthose afflicted with diseases such as leprosy do not wish to give it up.\n\nIt should be guarded for the sake of duty; duty for the sake of knowledge;\nknowledge for the sake of Yoga-meditation,--then he is soon released.\n\n22-23. If he does not guard himself against harm who else will? Therefore\nshould he look after his own benefit.\n\nHe who does not take precautions against the diseases of hell while here;\nafflicted with disease and having gone to a country where there is no\nmedicine, what will he do?\n\np. 157\n\n24-25. Old age comes on like a tigress; life goes like water from a broken\npot; diseases attack like foes. Therefore should he strive for the best.\n\nSo long as misery does not come, so long as calamity does not befall, so long\nas the senses are not decayed, so long should he strive for the best.\n\n26-32. So long as the body lasts, so long should truth be pursued,--the stupid\nman digs his well when the corner of his house is already afire.\n\nThe time of death is not known by those who are variously embodied in the\nworld of change. Alas! a man, between happiness and misery, does not know his\nown benefit.\n\nThough seeing those just born, the afflicted, the dead, those whom calamity\nhas befallen, and the miserable, people are never afraid, having drunk the\nliquor of delusion.\n\nRiches are like unto a dream; youth is like a flower, life is fickle as\nlightning,--where is there a discerning one who is at ease?\n\nEven a hundred years of life is very little, and half of it is sleep and\nidleness, and even that little is unfruitful owing to the miseries of\nchildhood, disease and old age.\n\np. 158\n\nHe does not do what ought to be done; when he should be awake he sleeps; where\nhe should fear he confides. Alas! what man is not stricken.\n\nHow shall the individual who has taken a body, which is like foam on water and\nis attached to passing objects, be free from fear?\n\n33-35. He who does not know what is good for him thinks the harmful\nbeneficial, the impermanent permanent, and the evil good;\n\nThough seeing, he falters; though hearing, he does not understand; though\nreading, he does not know; bewildered by the divine magic.\n\nThis universe is immersed in the boundless ocean of death,--though grasped by\nthe crocodiles of death, disease and old age, he does not understand.\n\n36-38. Time, though wearing away with every moment, is unnoticed, just as an\nunbaked pot placed in water disappears imperceptibly.\n\nAir may be enclosed, ether may be split; waves may be bound,--life cannot be\nmade permanent.\n\nEarth is burnt away by time; even Meru is reduced to powder; the water of the\nocean is dried away--what shall be said of the body?\n\np. 159\n\n39-41. The wolf of death forcibly slays the lamb of a mortal, who prates of\n"my offspring; my wife; my wealth; my relatives."\n\n"This has been done; this is to be done; this other is done or not done." Him\nwho is thus prating death overpowers.\n\n"It must be done to-morrow; it must be done to-day; in the morning or in the\nafternoon,"--death does not consider whether it leas been done or not done.\n\n42\\. Thou shalt encounter the enemy, death, whose, coming is shown by age, who\nhas an army of dreadful diseases--wilt thou not see the saviour?\n\n43-44. Death preys upon the man [afflicted](errata.htm#23) with the needles of\nthirst, bitten by the serpent of sense-objects, and baked in the fire of\ndesire and repulsion.\n\nDeath attacks children, young men, the old, those in the embryo condition,--\nsuch is this world of creatures.\n\n45-48. This individual, leaving his own body, goes to the abode of Yama. What\nis the good of association with wife, mother, father, son and others?\n\nThe world of change is verily the root of misery. He who is in it is afflicted\nwith misery. He who abandons it becomes happy,--otherwise never.\n\nThis world of change, which is the source of all misery, the seat of all\ncalamities, and the refuge of all sins, should be abandoned at once.\n\nA man bound in fetters of iron or wood may be released, but from the fetters\nof son and wife can never be freed.\n\np. 160\n\n49-51. So long as the being makes attachments pleasant to the mind, so long\nshall the dagger of sorrow pierce his heart.\n\nPeople are destroyed every day by the desire for great wealth. Alas! Fie upon\nthe foods of the senses, which steal away the senses of the body.\n\nJust as the fish, covetous of flesh, does not see the iron hook, so the\nembodied, covetous of pleasure, does not see the torments of Yama.\n\n52-55. Those men who do not understand what is good and what is not good for\nthem, who constantly pursue evil courses, and are intent on the filling of the\nbelly, are destined for hell, O Bird.\n\nSleep, sexual pleasure, and eating are common to all creatures. Who possesses\nknowledge is called a man, who is devoid of it is called a beast.\n\nFoolish men are tormented at break of day by nature\'s calls; when the sun is\nin the meridian by hunger and thirst; in the night by passion and sleep.\n\nAll those beings who are attached to their bodies, wealth, wife and other\nthings, are born and die deluded by ignorance, alas!\n\n56-57. Therefore should attachment be shunned always, It is not possible to\ngive up everything. therefore should friendship with the great be cultivated,\nas a remedy for attachment.\n\np. 161\n\nAttachment to the good, discrimination, and purity of the eyes--the man who\nhas not these is blind. How shall he not tread evil ways?\n\n58\\. All those deluded men who turn away from the duties of their respective\ncastes and orders, and do not understand the highest righteousness, perish\nfruitlessly.\n\n59-60. Some are intent upon ceremonies, attached to the practice of vows; with\nself enveloped in ignorance the imposters go about.\n\nThe men who are attached to the ceremonial alone are satisfied with mere\nnames, deluded by the repetitions of mantras, oblations and other things, and\nby elaborate rituals.\n\n61-62. The fools, bewildered by My magic, desire to obtain the invisible by\nsingle meals, fasts and other restraints, and by the emaciation of the body.\n\nOf those who have no discrimination, what liberation can there be by bodily\ntortures alone? What great serpent is killed by beating the anthill alone? 1\n\n63\\. The hypocrites, putting on appearances, and wearing quantities of matted\nhair, and using antelope skins, wander about like knowers, and even delude\npeople.\n\n64\\. He who is attached to the pleasures of the worlds of change, saying "I am\na knower of Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87," and is devoid of both rites and Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87 should be\nshunned like a low outcaste.\n\np. 162\n\n65-69. Donkeys walk about among people, in forests and among houses, quite\nnaked and unashamed. Are these free from attachment?\n\nIf men are to be liberated by earth, ashes and dust, does the dog which always\nlive among earth and ashes become liberated?\n\nThe jackals, rats, deer and others, which feed upon grass, leaves and water,\nand always live in forests,--do these become ascetics?\n\nThe crocodiles, fishes and others, which from birth to death, dwell in the\nwaters of Ganges,--do these become Yogins?\n\nPigeons at times eat stones, and Ch\xc4\x81taka birds do not drink water from the\nearth,--are these observers of vows?\n\n70\\. Therefore this class of practices is a thing which makes pleasure for\npeople, O Lord of Birds,--direct knowledge of the Truth is the cause of\nliberation.\n\n71-73. Fallen into the great well of the six philosophies, 1 O Bird, the\nbrutes do not understand the chief good; bound in the snare of animalism.\n\nThey are tossed hither and thither in the dreadful ocean of Vedas and \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras;\ncaught in the six waves they remain sophists.\n\np. 163\n\nHe who knows the Vedas, the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras and the Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, but does not know the\nchief good,--of that imitator all this is as the speech of a crow.\n\n71-76. "This is known; this must be known,"--thus bewildered by anxiety they\nread the scriptures day and night, turning away from the highest truth.\n\nThe fools, decorated with garlands of poetry constructed of forms of speech,\nmiserable with anxiety, remain with senses bewildered.\n\n76-77. Men trouble themselves variously, but the highest truth is otherwise;\nthey explain in different ways but the best purport of the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras is\notherwise.\n\nThey talk of the highest experiences, not realising them themselves. Some have\nceased preaching, being engrossed in egotism.\n\n78-82. They repeat the Vedas and the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras, and argue with one\n[another](errata.htm#24), but they do not understand the highest truth,--like\nthe spoon the flavour of the food.\n\nThe head bears flowers, the nostril knows the smell. They read the Vedas and\nthe \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras, but find impossible the understanding of the truth.\n\np. 164\n\nThe fool, not knowing that the truth is seated in himself, is bewildered by\nthe \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras,--a foolish goatherd, with the young goat under his arm, peers\ninto the well.\n\nVerbal knowledge cannot destroy the illusions of the world of change,--\ndarkness never disappears by talking of a lamp.\n\nReading, to a man devoid of wisdom, is like a mirror to the blind; hence, for\nthose who have understanding, \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras are only a potter to the knowledge of\nthe truth.\n\n83-84. "\'This is known; this must be known,"--he wishes to hear everything. If\none lives for a thousand celestial years he cannot reach the end of the\n\xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras.\n\nThe \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras are numerous; life is brief; and there are tens of millions of\nobstacles; therefore the essence should be understood,--like the swan taking\nthe milk in the water.\n\n85-86. Haring practised the Vedas and the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras, and having known the Truth,\nthe wise man should abandon all the scriptures; just as one rich in grains\nabandons the straw.\n\nJust as there is no use for food to one who is satisfied with nectar, so is\nthere not use for the scriptures, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, to the knower of the Truth.\n\n87-88. There is no liberation by the study of the Vedas, nor by the reading of\nthe \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras. Emancipation is by knowledge alone, not otherwise, O son of\nVinat\xc4\x81.\n\nThe stages of life are not the cause of liberation, nor are the philosophies,\nnor are actions,---knowledge only is the cause.\n\np. 165\n\n89-90. The word from the Teacher gives liberation; all learning is masquerade.\nAmong thousands of woods the Sa\xc3\xb1j\xc4\xabvana 1 is best.\n\nThe non-dual, verily declared auspicious, is beyond efforts of action, and to\nbe obtained by the word of the Teacher, not by the study of tens of millions\nof texts.\n\n91\\. Knowledge is said to be of two kinds: study and discrimination. The study\nis of \xc5\x9aabda Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87; Para Brahma\xe1\xb9\x87 is reached by discrimination.\n\n92\\. Some prefer the Non-dual 2; other prefer the Dual 3 but they do not\nunderstand the One Reality, beyond the Dual and Non-dual.\n\n93-94. Two phrases make for bondage and liberation: "Mine" and "Not-mine." The\nbeing saying "Mine" is bound; saying "Not-mine" is released.\n\nThat is the karma that does not bind, that the knowledge that gives release;\nother karma is worrying, other knowledge is skilful chiselling.\n\np. 166\n\n95-97. So long as actions are performed; so long as the impressions of the\nworld of change remain, so long as the senses are fickle; so long how can\nthere be realisation of Truth?\n\nSo long as there is pride of body; so long as there is the sense of\n"mineness," so long as there is excited striving; so long as there is\nimagination of plans;\n\nSo long as there is not stability of mind; so long as there is no meditation\nupon the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras, so long as there is no love for the Teacher; so long how can\nthere be realisation of Truth?\n\n98-99. So long as one does not reach Truth, so long should he do austerities,\nvows, pilgrimage to sacred waters, recitations, oblations, worship and reading\nof the prescribed texts of the Vedas and \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras.\n\nTherefore, if one desires liberation for himself, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, he should every\neffort, always, and under all circumstances he attached to Truth.\n\n100\\. One who is tormented by the three miseries and the rest, should resort\nto the shade of the tree of Liberation, whose flowers are righteousness and\nknowledge, and fruits are heaven and liberation.\n\n101\\. Therefore from the mouth of the Blessed Teacher the Truth of the self\nshould be known. By knowledge the being is easily released from the awful\nbondage of the worlds of change.\n\n102\\. Listen! I will tell you now about the final actions of the knower of the\nTruth, by which he obtains liberation, which is called the Nirv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a of Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87.\n\np. 167\n\n103-107. His last days approaching, the man, rid of fear, should cut off, with\nthe sword of unattachment, the desires connected with the body.\n\nCourageously wandering from home, performing ablutions in the water of the\nholy bathing places, sitting alone on a pure seat prepared as prescribed,\n\nHe should practise mentally upon the supreme three-fold pure Word of Brahm\xc4\x81.\nHe should, with breath controlled, restrain his mind, not forgetting the\nBrahma B\xc4\xabja. 1\n\nWith reason for charioteer he should withdraw the senses from the sense-\nobjects by the mind, and should fix his mind, drawn away by karmas, with\nunderstanding, upon the pure.\n\n"1 am Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87, the Supreme Abode; I am Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87, the Highest Goal,"--having\nrealised this and placed the self in the self he should meditate.\n\n108\\. He who, when leaving the body, utters the one-syllabled Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87, "O\xe1\xb9\x81,"\nremembering me, goes to the Highest Goal.\n\n109-110. The hypocrites, devoid of knowledge and unattachment, do not go\nthere. I will tell you about the wise, who go to that goal.\n\nFree from pride and delusion, with the evils of attachment conquered, always\ndwelling in the Higher Self, with desires overcome, released from the\ncontracts known as pleasure and pain, they go, undeluded, on that eternal\npath.\n\np. 168\n\n111-114. He who bathes in the water of the M\xc4\x81nasa, 1 which removes the\nimpurities of attraction and repulsion, in the lake of knowledge, in the\nwaters of Truth,--he verily attains liberation.\n\nHe who, firm in non-attachment, worships me, thinking of no other, full-\nvisioned, with tranquil self,--he verily attains liberation.\n\nHe who, expecting to die, leaning his home, dwells at a sacred bathing-place,\nor dies in a place of liberation, he verily attains liberation.\n\nAyodhy\xc4\x81,  2 Mathur\xc4\x81, 3 Gay\xc4\x81, 4 Ka\xc5\x9b\xc4\xab, 5 Ka\xc3\xb1chi, 6 Avantik\xc4\x81, 7 Dw\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81vat\xc4\xab,\n8\\--these seven cities should be known as the givers of liberation.\n\n115\\. This eternal way of liberal in al has been described to you, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya,\n--hearing it with knowledge and dispassion one attains liberation.\n\n116\\. Knowers of Truth attain liberation; righteous men go to heaven; sinners\ngo to an evil condition; birds and others transmigrate.\n\n117\\. Thus in sixteen chapters I have related to you the extracted essence of\nall the scriptures. What else do you wish to hear?\n\np. 169\n\n118-120. S\xc5\xabta said: Having thus heard, O King, these words from the mouth of\nthe Lord, Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da, repeatedly prostrating himself, said this, with hands folded\ntogether:--\n\n"O Lord, O God of Gods, having heard these words of nectar I have been helped\nover the ocean of existence, O Lord, O. Protector!\n\n"I stand freed from doubts. My desires have been completely fulfilled." Having\nsaid this, Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da became silent and lost in meditation.\n\n121\\. May Hari, the remembrance of whom removes evil, who gives the condition\nof happiness for the sacrifice of worship, and who gives liberation for\nsupreme devotion to Him,--protect us.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[155:1](gpu18.htm#fr_188) That is, One who knows the Self.\n\n[156:1](gpu18.htm#fr_189) Meaning that one may re-obtain these things after\nlosing them--but not the body.\n\n[161:1](gpu18.htm#fr_190) There is supposed to be a serpent living in the\nground beneath the ant-hill.\n\n[162:1](gpu18.htm#fr_191) Ny\xc4\x81ya, Vai\xc5\x9be\xe1\xb9\xa3ika, S\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x85khya, Yoga, M\xc4\xabm\xc4\x81ns\xc4\x81, Ved\xc4\x81nta.\n\n[165:1](gpu18.htm#fr_192) The plant brought by Hanumat to restore Lak\xe1\xb9\xa3man when\nkilled by Indrajit.\n\n[165:2](gpu18.htm#fr_193) Adwaita philosophy.
