[1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 274\n\n13:1:1\n\n# THIRTEENTH K\xc3\x82 _N_ _D_ A.\n\n#### THE A _S_ VAMEDHA, OR HORSE-SACRIFICE.\n\n#### PRELIMINARY CEREMONIES 1.\n\n### FIRST ADHY\xc3\x82YA. FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n13:1:1:11\\. He (the Adhvaryu) cooks the priests' mess of rice 2: it is seed he\nthereby produces. Having greased a rope with the ghee which is left over 3, he\ntakes it; for ghee is (a type of) fiery spirit, and the horse is sacred to Pra\n_g_ apati 4: he thus endows Pra _g_ apati with fiery spirit. Impure, and unfit\nfor sacrifice, indeed, is that (animal), to wit, the horse.\n\n13:1:1:22\\. The rope consists of darbha grass (poa cynosuroides);--for darbha\nstalks 5 are a means of purification: he thus purifies that (horse), and\nimmolates it as one purified and meet for sacrifice.\n\n13:1:1:33\\. Now, when the horse 6 was immolated, its\n\np. 275\n\nseed went from it and became gold 1: thus, when he gives gold (to the priests)\nhe supplies the horse with seed.\n\n13:1:1:44\\. Pra _g_ apati produced the sacrifice 2. His greatness departed\nfrom him, and entered the great sacrificial priests 3. Together with the great\npriests he went in search of it, and together with the great priests he found\nit: when the great priests eat the priests' mess of rice, the Sacrificer\nthereby secures for himself the greatness of the sacrifice. Along with the\npriests' mess of rice he presents gold (to the priests); for the mess of rice\nis seed, and gold is seed: by means of seed he thus lays seed into that\n(horse, and Sacrificer). It (the gold 4) weighs a hundred (grains); for man\nhas a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred energies: it is life, and\nenergy, vigour, he lays into his own self. At midday he takes Vasativari 5\nwater of four kinds; it is brought together from the (four) quarters, for food\nis in (all) the (four) quarters, and water is food: by means of food he thus\nsecures food for him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[274:1](sbe44074.htm#fr_680) The ceremonies treated of in the first six\nchapters (brahma _n_ as) refer to the setting apart of the horse for its\nsacred office, a year before the sacrifice, and to the intervening period\nduring which the horse is allowed to roam about, though under careful\nsupervision.\n\n[274:2](sbe44074.htm#fr_681) For further particulars regarding this opening\nceremony of the sacrifice see [XIII, 4, 1, 1](sbe44102.htm#13:4:1:1) seqq.\n\n[274:3](sbe44074.htm#fr_682) Viz. from the ghee used for greasing the four\ndishes of cooked rice.\n\n[274:4](sbe44074.htm#fr_683) Or, the horse is of the nature of Pra _g_ apati.\n\n[274:5](sbe44074.htm#fr_684) See above, [p. 195](sbe44061.htm#page_195), note\n[1](sbe44061.htm#fn_532).\n\n[274:6](sbe44074.htm#fr_685) That is, as would seem, Pra _g_ apati in the form\nof a horse, see part iv, introd., p. xiv seqq.\n\n[275:1](sbe44074.htm#fr_686) Pra _g_ apati is Agni, and gold is Agni's seed,\ncf. II, 1, 1, 5; III, 3, 1, 3 &c.\n\n[275:2](sbe44074.htm#fr_687) That is, the A _s_ vamedha sacrifice, and thus\nthe immolation (or emptying out) of his own self, so to speak.\n\n[275:3](sbe44074.htm#fr_688) That is, the four principal officiating priests,\nBrahman, Hot _ri_ , Adhvaryu, and Udgat _ri_. Cf. VIII, 4, 3, 1 seqq., where\nit is the vital airs that, in their capacity as _Ri_ shis, assist Pra _g_\napati in the first sacrifice.\n\n[275:4](sbe44074.htm#fr_689) That is to say, each piece of gold weighs as\nmuch. According to Katy. XX, 1, 6 he is to give to the priests 4000 cows and\nas many _S_ atamana coins.\n\n[275:5](sbe44074.htm#fr_690) For this water used for the Soma-sacrifice where,\nhowever, it is taken from a cistern, or some course of flowing water, see part\nii, p. 222 seqq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 1, 2.
