 \nBy flying steeds so swiftly borne,  \nArt thou not weak and travel-worn?  \nHow fares the king my father, tell:  \nIs Yudhajit thine uncle well?  \nAnd now, my son, at length declare  \nThe pleasure of the visit there.'  \n\nThus to the offspring of the king  \nShe spake with tender questioning,  \nAnd to his mother made reply  \nYoung Bharat of the lotus eye:  \n'The seventh night has come and fled  \nSince from my grandsire's home I sped:  \nMy mother's sire is well, and he,  \nYudhajit, from all trouble free.  \nThe gold and every precious thing  \nPresented by the conqueror king,  \nThe slower guards behind convey:  \nI left them weary on the way.  \nUrged by the men my father sent,  \nMy hasty course I hither bent:  \nNow, I implore, an answer deign,  \nAnd all I wish to know, explain.  \n\nUnoccupied I now behold  \nThis couch of thine adorned with gold,  \nAnd each of King Ikshvaku's race  \nAppears with dark and gloomy face.  \nThe king is aye, my mother dear,  \nMost constant in his visits here.  \nTo meet my sire I sought this spot:  \nHow is it that I find him not?  \nI long to clasp my father's feet:  \nSay where he lingers, I entreat.  \nPerchance the monarch may be seen  \nWhere dwells Kaus'alya, eldest queen.'  \n\nHis father's fate, from him concealed.  \nKaikeyi to her son revealed:  \nTold as glad news the story sad,  \nFor lust of sway had made her mad:  \n'Thy father, O my darling, know,  \nHas gone the way all life must go:  \nDevout and famed, of lofty thought,  \nIn whom the good their refuge sought.'  \n\nWhen Bharat pious, pure, and true,  \nHeard the sad words which pierced him through,  \nGrieved for the sire he loved so well  \nProstrate upon the ground he fell:  \nDown fell the strong-armed hero, high  \nTossing his arms, and a sad cry,  \n'Ah, woe is me, unhappy, slain!'  \nBurst from his lips again, again,  \nAfflicted for his father's fate  \nBy grief's intolerable weight,  \nWith every sense amazed and cowed  \nThe splendid hero wailed aloud:  \n'Ah me, my royal father's bed  \nOf old a gentle radiance shed,  \nLike the pure sky when clouds are past,  \nAnd the moon's light is o'er it cast:  \nAh, of its wisest lord bereft,  \nIt shows to-day faint radiance left,  \nAs when the moon has left the sky.  \nOr mighty Ocean's depths are dry.'  \n\nWith choking sobs, with many a tear.  \nPierced to the heart with grief sincere,  \nThe best of conquerors poured his sighs,  \nAnd with his robe veiled face and eyes.  \nKaikeyi saw him fallen there,  \nGodlike, afflicted, in despair,  \nUsed every art to move him thence,  \nAnd tried him thus with eloquence:  \n'Arise, arise, my dearest; why  \nWilt thou, famed Prince, so lowly lie?  \nNot by such grief as this are moved  \nGood men like thee, by all approved.  \nThe earth thy father nobly swayed,  \nAnd rites to Heaven he duly paid.  \nAt length his race of life was run:  \nThou shouldst not mourn for him, my son.'  \n\nLong on the ground he wept, and rolled  \nFrom side to side, still unconsoled,  \nAnd then, with bitter grief oppressed,  \nHis mother with those words addressed:  \n\np. 181  \n\n'This joyful hope my bosom fed  \nWhen from my grandsire's halls I sped--  \n'The king will throne his eldest son,  \nAnd sacrifice, as should be done.'  \nBut all is changed, my hope was vain,  \nAnd this sad heart is rent in twain,  \nFor my dear father's face I miss,  \nWho ever sought his loved ones' bliss.  \nBut in my absence, mother, say,  \nWhat sickness took my sire away?  \nAh, happy Rama, happy they  \nAllowed his funeral rites to pay!  \nThe glorious monarch has not learned  \nThat I his darling have returned,  \nOr quickly had he hither sped,  \nAnd pressed his kisses on my head.  \nWhere is that hand whose gentle touch,  \nMost soft and kind I loved so much,  \nThe hand that loved to brush away  \nThe dust that on his darling lay?  \nQuick, bear the news to Rama's ear;  \nTell the great chief that I am here:  \nBrother, and sire, and friend, and all  \nIs he, and I his trusty thrall,  \nFor noble hearts, to virtue true,  \nTheir sires in elder brothers view.  \nTo clasp his feet I fain would bow:  \nHe is my hope and refuge now.  \nWhat said my glorious sire, who knew  \nVirtue and vice, so brave and true?  \nFirm in his vows, dear lady, say,  \nWhat said he ere he passed away?  \nWhat was his rede to me? I crave  \nTo hear the last advice he gave.'  \n\nThus closely questioned by the youth,  \nKaikeyi spoke the mournful truth:  \n'The high-souled monarch wept and sighed,  \nFor Rama, Sita, Lakshman, cried,  \nThen, best of all who go to bliss,  \nPassed to the world which follows this.  \n'Ah, blessed are the people who  \nShall Rama and his Sita view,  \nAnd Lakshman of the mighty arm,  \nReturning free from scathe and harm.'  \nSuch were the words, the last of all,  \nThy father, ere he died, let fall,  \nBy Fate and Death's dread coils enwound,  \nAs some great elephant is bound.'  \n\nHe heard, yet deeper in despair,  \nHer lips this double woe declare,  \nAnd with sad brow that showed his pain  \nQuestioned his mother thus again:  \n'But where is he, of virtue tried,  \nWho fills Kaus'alya's heart with pride,  \nWhere is the noble Rama? where  \nIs Lakshman brave, and Sita fair?'  \n\nThus pressed, the queen began to tell  \nThe story as each thing befell,  \nAnd gave her son in words like these,  \nThe mournful news she meant to please:  \n'The prince is gone in hermit dress  \nTo Dandak's mighty wilderness,  \nAnd Lakshman brave and Sita share  \nThe wanderings of the exile there.'  \n\nThen Bharat's soul with fear was stirred  \nLest Rama from the right had erred,  \nAnd jealous for ancestral fame,  \nHe put this question to the dame:  \n'Has Rama grasped with lawless hold  \nA Brahman's house, or land, or gold?  \nHas Rama harmed with ill intent  \nSome poor or wealthy innocent?  \nWas Rama, faithless to his vows,  \nEnamoured of anothers spouse?  \nWhy was he sent to Dandak's wild,  \nLike one who kills an unborn child?'  \n\nHe questioned thus: and she began  \nTo tell her deeds and crafty plan.  \nDeceitful-hearted, fond, and blind  \nAs is the way of womankind:  \n'No Brahman's wealth has Rama seized,  \nNo dame his wandering fancy pleased;  \nHis very eyes he ne'er allows  \nTo gaze upon a neighbour's spouse,  \nBut when I heard the monarch planned  \nTo give the realm to Rama's hand,  \nI prayed that Rama hence might flee,  \nAnd claimed the throne, my son, for thee.  \nThe king maintained the name he bare,  \nAnd did according to my prayer.  \nAnd Rama, with his brother, sent,  \nAnd Sita, forth to banishment.  \nWhen his dear son was seen no more,  \nThe lord of earth was troubled sore:  \nToo feeble with his grief to strive,  \nHe joined the elemental Five.  \nUp then, most dutiful! maintain  \nThe royal state, arise, and reign.  \nFor thee, my darling son, for thee  \nAll this was planned and wrought by me.  \nCome, cast thy grief and pain aside,  \nWith manly courage fortified.  \nThis town and realm are all thine own,  \nAnd fear and grief are here unknown.  \nCome, with Vas'ishtha's guiding aid,  \n   And priests in ritual skilled  \nLet the king's funeral dues be paid,  \n   And every claim fulfilled.  \nPerform his obsequies with all  \n   That suits his rank and worth,  \nThen give the mandate to install  \n   Thyself as lord of earth.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXIII.: Kaikeyi Reproached.](ry151.htm)\n\n"
