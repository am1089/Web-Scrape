(There is something) higher than that; on account of the designations of\nbridge, measure, connexion, and difference.\n\nThe Sutras now proceed to refute an erroneous view based on some fallacious\narguments, viz. that there is a being higher even than the highest Brahman,\nthe supreme cause, material as well as operative, of the entire world--a\nrefutation which will confirm the view of Brahman being free from all\nimperfections and a treasure as it were of countless transcendentally exalted\nqualities.--There is some entity higher than the Brahman described so far as\nbeing the cause of the world and possessing the twofold characteristics. For\nthe text 'That Self is a bank (or bridge), a boundary' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 4, 1)\ndesignates the Self as a bank or bridge (setu). And the term 'setu' means in\nordinary language that which enables one to reach the other bank of a river;\nand from this we conclude that in the Vedic text also there must be meant\nsomething to be reached. The text further says that that bridge is to be\ncrossed:\n\np. 622\n\n[paragraph continues] 'He who has crossed that bridge, if blind,' &c.; this\nalso indicates that there must be something to be reached by crossing. Other\ntexts, again, speak of the highest Brahman as something measured, i.e.\nlimited. 'Brahman has four feet (quarters), sixteen parts.' Such declarations\nof Brahman being something limited suggest the existence of something\nunlimited to be reached by that bridge. Further there are texts which declare\na connexion of the bridge as that which is a means towards reaching, and a\nthing connected with the bridge as that to be reached: 'the highest bridge of\nthe Immortal' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 19); 'he is the bridge of the Immortal' (Mu.\nUp. II, 2, 5). For this reason also there is something higher than the\nHighest.--And other texts again expressly state that being beyond the Highest\nto be something different: 'he goes to the divine Person who is higher than\nthe Highest' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8); ' by this Person this whole universe is\nfilled; what is higher than that is without form and without suffering' ( _S_\nvet. Up. III, 9-10). All this combined shows that there is something higher\nthan the highest Brahman.--The next Sutra disposes of this view.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 31. But on account of resemblance](sbe48375.htm)\n\n"
