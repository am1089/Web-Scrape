And as he walked along, the goblin said: "O King, I will\ntell you a story to amuse your weariness. Listen."\n\n\n\nOn the shore of the Eastern Ocean is Copper City. There a king named Fierce-\nlion lived. He turned his back to other men\'s wives, but not to fighting men.\nHe destroyed his enemies, but not other men\'s wealth.\n\nOne day a popular prince named Good came from the south to the king\'s gate. He\nintroduced himself, but did not get what he wanted from the king. And he\nthought: "If I am born a prince, why am I so poor? And if I am to be poor, why\ndid God give me so many desires? For this king pays no attention to me, though\nI wait upon him and grow weary and faint with hunger."\n\nWhile he was thinking, the king went hunting. He went with many horsemen and\nfootmen, and the prince ran along in the dress of a pilgrim with a club in his\nhand. And during the hunt the king chased a great boar a long distance, and so\ncame into another forest. There he lost sight of the boar, for the trail was\ncovered with leaves and grass. And the king was tired and lost his way in the\nforest. Only the pilgrim-prince thought nothing of his life, and hungry and\nthirsty as he was, he followed on foot the king who rode a swift horse.\n\nAnd when the king saw him following, he spoke lovingly: "My good man, do you\nperhaps know the way we came?"\n\nAnd the pilgrim bowed low and said: "I know, your Majesty. But first rest\nyourself a moment. The blazing sun, the middle jewel in the girdle of heaven\'s\nbride, is terribly hot." Then the king said eagerly: "See if there is water\nanywhere."\n\nAnd the pilgrim agreed and climbed a high tree and looked around. And he saw a\nriver and climbed down and took the king to it. He unsaddled the horse, gave\nhim water and grass, and let him rest. And when the king had bathed, the\npilgrim took two fine mangoes from his skirt, washed them and gave them to the\nking.\n\n"Where did you get these?" asked the king, and the pilgrim bowed and said:\n"Your Majesty, I have lived on such food for ten years. While I was serving\nyour Majesty, I had to live like a monk." And the king said: "What can I say?\nYou deserve your name of Good." And he was filled with pity and shame, and\nthought: "A curse on kings, who do not know whether their servants are happy\nor not! And a curse of their attendants, who do not tell them this and that!"\nAnd when the pilgrim insisted, the king was prevailed on to take the two\nmangoes. He rested there with the pilgrim and ate the mangoes and drank water\nwith the pilgrim, who was accustomed to eat mangoes and drink water.\n\nThen the pilgrim saddled the horse and went ahead to show the way, and at\nlast, at the king\'s command, mounted behind on the horse; so the king found\nhis soldiers and went safely home. And when he got there, he proclaimed the\ndevotion of the pilgrim, and made him a rich man, but could not feel that he\nhad paid his debt. So Good stayed there happily with King Fierce-lion and\nstopped living as a pilgrim.\n\nOne day the king sent Good to Ceylon to ask for the hand of the daughter of\nthe King of Ceylon. So he set out after sacrificing to the proper god, and\nentered a ship with some Brahmans chosen by the king. And when the ship had\nsafely reached the middle of the ocean, there suddenly arose from the waves a\nvery large flag-pole made of gold, with a top that touched the sky. It was\nadorned with waving banners of various colours and was quite astonishing.  \n\nAt the same moment the clouds gathered, it began to rain violently, and a\nmighty wind blew. And the ship was driven by the storm winds and caught on the\nflag-pole. Then the pole began to sink, dragging the ship with it into the\nraging waves. And the Brahmans who were there were overcome with fear and\ncursed the name of their king Fierce-lion.\n\nBut Good could not endure that because of his devotion to his king. He took\nhis sword in his hand, girt up his garment, and threw himself after the flag-\npole into the sea. He had no fear of the pole which seemed a refuge from the\nocean. Then as he sank, the ship was battered by the winds and waves and broke\nup. And all in it fell into the mouths of sharks.\n\nBut Good sank into the ocean, and when he looked about he saw a wonderful\ncity. There he entered a shrine to Gauri, tall as the heavenly mountain, with\ngreat gem-sprinkled banners on walls made of different kinds of jewels, in a\ngolden temple blazing with jewelled pillars, with a garden that had a pool,\nthe stairs to which were made of splendid gems. After he had bowed low and\npraised and worshipped the goddess there, he sat down before her in amazement,\nwondering if it was all a conjuror\'s trick.\n\nJust then the door was suddenly opened by a heavenly maiden. Her eyes were\nlike lotuses, her face like the moon. She had a smile like a flower and a body\nsoft as lotus-stems. And a thousand women waited upon her. She entered the\nshrine of the goddess and the heart of Good at the same moment. And when she\nhad worshipped the goddess there, she went out from the shrine, but not from\nthe heart of Good.\n\nShe entered a circle of light, and Good followed her. And he saw another\nsplendid house, that seemed like a place of meeting for all riches and all\nenjoyments. And he saw the girl sitting on a jewelled couch, and he approached\nand sat beside her. He was like a man painted in a picture, for his eyes were\nfastened on her face.\n\nNow a servant of the maiden saw that his body was thrilled, that he was intent\nupon the maiden, that he was in love. She understood his feelings and said to\nhim: "Sir, you are our guest. Enjoy the hospitality of my mistress. Arise.\nBathe. Eat." And he felt a little hope at her words and went to a pool in the\ngarden which she showed him.\n\nHe plunged into the pool, and when he rose to the surface, he found himself in\nthe pool of King Fierce-lion in Copper City. And when he saw that he had come\nthere so suddenly, he thought: "Oh, what does it mean? Where is that heavenly\ngarden? What a difference between the sight of that girl which was like nectar\nto me, and this immediate separation from her which is like terrible poison!\nIt was no dream. I was awake when the serving-maid deceived me and made a fool\nof me."\n\nHe was like a madman without the girl. He wandered in the garden and mourned\nin a lovelorn way. He was surrounded by wind-blown flower-pollen which seemed\nto him the yellow flames of separation. And when the gardener saw him in this\nstate, he went and told the king.\n\nAnd the king was troubled. He went himself to see Good, and asked him\nsoothingly: "What does this mean? Tell me, my friend. Where did you go? And\nwhere did you come? And where did you stay? And what did you fall into?"\n\nThen Good told him the whole adventure. And the king thought: "Ah, it is\nfortunate for me that this brave man is lovelorn. For now I have a chance to\npay my debt to him." So the king said to him: "My friend, give over this vain\ngrief. I will go with you by the same road, and bring you to the heavenly\nmaiden." So he comforted Good, and made him take a bath.\n\nThe next day he transferred his royal duties to his counsellors and entered a\nship with Good. Good showed the way through the sea and they saw the flag-pole\nwith its banners rising as before in the middle of the ocean. Then Good said\nto the king: "Your Majesty, here is the magic flag-pole standing up. When I\nsink down there, you must sink too along the flag-pole." So when they came\nnear the sinking pole, Good jumped first, and the king followed him.\n\nThey sank down and came to the heavenly city. And the king was astonished, and\nafter he had worshipped the goddess, he sat down with Good. Then the girl,\nlike Beauty personified, came out of the circle of light with her friends.\n"There she is, the lovely creature," said Good, and the king thought: "He is\nquite right to love her." But when she saw the king looking like a god, she\nwondered who the strange and wonderful man might be, and entered the shrine to\nworship the goddess.\n\nBut the king took Good and went into the garden to show how little he cared\nabout her. A moment later the girl came from the shrine; she had been praying\nfor a good husband. And she said to a girl friend: "My friend, I wonder where\nI could see the man who was here. Where is the great man? You girls must hunt\nfor him and ask him to be good enough to come and accept our hospitality. For\nhe is a wonderful man, and we must be polite to him."\n\nSo the girl found him in the garden and gave him her mistress\' message very\nrespectfully. But the brave king spoke loftily to her: "Your words are\nhospitality enough. Nothing else is necessary."\n\nNow when her mistress had heard what he said, she thought he was a noble\ncharacter, better than anybody else. She was attracted by the courage of the\nking in refusing a sort of hospitality which was almost too much to offer a\nmere man, and thought about the fulfilment of her prayer for a husband. So she\nwent into the garden herself. She drew near to the king and lovingly begged\nhim to accept her hospitality.\n\nBut the king pointed to Good and said: "My dear girl, he told me of the\ngoddess here, and I came to see her. And by following the flag-pole I saw the\ngoddess and her very marvellous temple. It was only afterwards that I happened\nto see you."\n\nThen the girl said: "O King, you may be interested in seeing a city which is\nthe wonder of the three worlds." And the king laughed and said: "He told me\nabout that, too. I believe there is a pool for bathing there." And the girl\nsaid: "O King, do not say that. I am not a deceitful girl. Why should I\ndeceive an honourable man, especially as your noble character has made me feel\nlike a servant? Pray do not refuse me."\n\nSo the king agreed and went with Good and the girl to the edge of the circle\nof light. There a door opened and he entered and saw another heavenly city\nlike a second hill of heaven; for it was built of gems and gold, and the\nflowers and fruits of every season grew there at the same time.\n\nAnd the princess seated the king on a splendid throne and brought him gifts\nand said: "Your Majesty, I am the daughter of the great god Black-wheel. But\nVishnu sent my father to heaven. And I inherited these two magic cities where\none has everything he wants. There is no old age or death to trouble us here.\nAnd now you are in the place of my father to rule over the cities and over\nme." So she offered him herself and all she had. But the king said: "In that\ncase you are my daughter and I give you in marriage to my brave friend good."\n\nIn the king\'s words she saw the fulfilment of her prayer, and being sensible\nand modest, she agreed. So the king married them and gave all the magic wealth\nto happy Good, and said: "My friend, I have paid you now for one of the two\nmangoes which I ate. But I remain in your debt for the second."\n\nThen he asked the princess how he could get back to his city. And she gave the\nking a sword called Invincible, and the magic fruit which wards off birth, old\nage, and death. And the king took the sword and the fruit, plunged into the\npool which she showed him, and came up in his own country, feeling completely\nsuccessful. But Good ruled happily over the kingdom of the princess.\n\n\n\nWhen the goblin had told this story, he asked the king: "O King, which of\nthese two deserves more credit for plunging into the sea?"\n\nAnd the king was afraid of the curse, so he gave a true answer: "Good seems to\nme the more deserving, for he did not know the truth beforehand, but plunged\nwithout hope into the sea, while the king knew the truth when he jumped."\n\nAnd as soon as the king broke silence, the goblin slipped from his shoulder as\nbefore without being seen and went to the sissoo tree. And the king tried as\nbefore to catch him. Brave men do not waver until they have finished what they\nhave begun.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Eighth Goblin: The Specialist in Food, the Specialist in Women, and the\nSpecialist in Cotton.
