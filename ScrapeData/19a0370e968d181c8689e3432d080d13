His minister was\none Abhaichand, a Jain, by whose teachings the king also came into the Jain\nfaith.\n\nThe worship of Shiva and of Vishnu, gifts of cows, gifts of lands, gifts of\nrice balls, gaming and spirit-drinking, all these he prohibited. In the city\nno man could get leave to do them, and as for bones, into the Ganges no man\nwas allowed to throw them, and in these matters the minister, having taken\norders from the king, caused a proclamation to be made about the city, saying,\n"Whoever these acts shall do, the Raja having confiscated, will punish him and\nbanish him from the city."\n\nNow one day the Diwan[169] began to say to the Raja, "O great king, to the\ndecisions of the Faith be pleased to give ear. Whosoever takes the life of\nanother, his life also in the future birth is taken: this very sin causes him\nto be born again and again upon earth and to die And thus he ever continues to\nbe born again and to die. Hence for one who has found entrance into this world\nto cultivate religion is right and proper. Be pleased to behold! By love, by\nwrath, by pain, by desire, and by fascination overpowered, the gods Brahma,\nVishnu, and Mahadeva (Shiva) in various ways upon the earth are ever becoming\nincarnate. Far better than they is the Cow, who is free from passion, enmity,\ndrunkenness, anger, covetousness, and inordinate affection, who supports\nmankind, and whose progeny in many ways give ease and solace to the creatures\nof the world These deities and sages (munis) believe in the Cow.[170]\n\n"For such reason to believe in the gods is not good. Upon this earth be\npleased to believe in the Cow. It is our duty to protect the life of everyone,\nbeginning from the elephant, through ants, beasts, and birds, up to man. In\nthe world righteousness equal to that there is none. Those who, eating the\nflesh of other creatures, increase their own flesh, shall in the fulness of\ntime assuredly obtain the fruition of Narak [17l]; hence for a man it is\nproper to attend to the conversation of life. They who understand not the pain\nof other creatures, and who continue to slay and to devour them, last but few\ndays in the land, and return to mundane existence, maimed, limping, one-eyed,\nblind, dwarfed, hunchbacked, and imperfect in such wise. Just as they consume\nthe bodies of beasts and of birds, even so they end by spoiling their own\nbodies. From drinking spirits also the great sin arises, hence the consuming\nof spirits and flesh is not advisable."\n\nThe minister having in this manner explained to the king the sentiments of his\nown mind, so brought him over to the Jain faith, that whatever he said, so the\nking did. Thus in Brahmans, in Jogis, in Janganis, in Sevras, in\nSannyasis,[172] and in religious mendicants, no man believed, and according to\nthis creed the rule was carried on.\n\nNow one day, being in the power of Death, Raja Gunshekhar died. Then his son\nDharmadhwaj sat upon the carpet (throne), and began to rule. Presently he\ncaused the minister Abhaichand to be seized, had his head shaved all but seven\nlocks of hair, ordered his face to be blackened, and mounting him on an ass,\nwith drums beaten, had him led all about the city, and drove him from the\nkingdom. From that time he carried on his rule free from all anxiety.\n\nIt so happened that in the season of spring, the king Dharmadhwaj, taking his\nqueens with him, went for a stroll in the garden, where there was a large tank\nwith lotuses blooming within it. The Raja admiring its beauty, took off his\nclothes and went down to bathe.\n\nAfter plucking a flower and coming to the bank, he was going to give it into\nthe hands of one of his queens, when it slipped from his fingers, fell upon\nher foot, and broke it with the blow. Then the Raja being alarmed, at once\ncame out of the tank, and began to apply remedies to her.\n\nHereupon night came on, and the moon shone brightly: the falling of its rays\non the body of the second queen formed blisters And suddenly from a distance\nthe sound of a wooden pestle came out of a householder\'s dwelling, when the\nthird queen fainted away with a severe pain in the head\n\nHaving spoken thus much the Baital said "O my king! of these three which is\nthe most delicate?" The Raja answered, "She indeed is the most delicate who\nfainted in consequence of the headache." The Baital hearing this speech, went\nand hung himself from the very same tree, and the Raja, having gone there and\ntaken him down and fastened him in the bundle and placed him on his shoulder,\ncarried him away.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Vampire\'s Eleventh Story.
