The Ri _s_ is said :-- \xc2\x93O Suta! Our minds are merged in the sea of doubt,\nhearing your this most wonderful saying, surprising to the whole world. The\nhead of Janardan Madhava, the Lord of all, was severed out of His body! And He\nwas afterwards known as Hayagriva, the horse-faced! Oh! what more wonder can\nthere be than this? Whom the Vedas even praise, all the Devas rest on Whom,\nWho is the Cause of all causes,\n\n\n\np. 13\n\n\n\nthe \xc3\x82di Deva Jagannath (the Lord of the universe), Oh! how is it that His head\ncame to be severed! O highly intelligent one! Describe all this to me in\ndetail\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\n5-9. Suta said :-- O Munis! Hear all attentively the glorious deeds of the\nsupremely energetic Vi _sn_ u, the Deva of the Devas. Once on a time the\neternal Deva Janardana became tired after the terrible continuous battle for\nten thousand years. After this the Lord Narayana seated Himself on Padmasan (a\nkind of posture) in some lovely place on a level plot of ground and placing\nhis head on the front of his bow with the bow strung and placed erect on the\nground fell fast asleep. Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of Rama, was exceedingly tired\nand thus he fell soon into deep sleep. At this time Indra and the other Devas,\nwith Brahma and Mahe _s_ a began a sacrifice.\n\n\n\n10-13. Then they, for the sake of success in Deva's well, went to the region\nof Vaiku _nt_ ha to meet with the Deva Janardana, the Lord of sacrifices.\nThere the Devas, not finding Vi _sn_ u, came to know by their Dhyan\n(meditation) where Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u was staying and thither they went. They\nsaw that the Lord Vi _sn_ u, the Deva of the Devas was lying unconscious,\nbeing under the arms of Yoganidra (the yogic sleep). Therefore they took their\nseats there. Seeing the Lord of the universe asleep, Brahma, Rudra and the\nother Devas became anxious.\n\n\n\n14-18. Indra then addressed the Devas :--\xc2\x93O best of the Suras! Now what is to\nbe done! How shall we rouse Bhagavan from His sleep? Now think of the means by\nwhich this can be effected\xc2\x94. Hearing Indra's words S\xc2\x92ambhu said :-- \xc2\x93O good\nDevas! Now we must finish our sacrificial work. But if the sleep of Bhagavan\nbe disturbed, He would get angry.\xc2\x94 Hearing S\xc2\x92ankara's words, Parame _st_ hi\nBrahma created Vamri insects (a sort of white ants) so that they might eat up\nthe forepart of the bow that was lying on the ground causing the other end\nrise up and thus break His sleep. Thus the Deva's purpose will, no doubt, be\nfulfilled. Thus settling his mind, the eternal Deva Brahma ordered the white\nants Vamris to cut the bow string.\n\n19-22. Hearing this order of Brahma, Vamri spoke to Brahma, thus :-- \xc2\x93O\nBrahman! How can I disturb the sleep of the Devadeva, Lord of Lak _s_ mi, the\nWorld Guru? To rouse one from one's deep sleep, to interrupt one in one's\nspeech, to sever the love between a couple husband and wife, to separate a\nchild from one's mother, all these are equivalent to Brahmahatya (murdering a\nBrahman). Therefore, O Deva! how can I interrupt the happiuess of sleep of the\nDevadeva? And what benefit shall I derive by eating the bowstring, so that I\nmay incur this vicious act? But a man can commit a sin if there be any\ninterest of his; I am ready to eat this, if I get a personal interest\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\np. 14\n\n\n\n23-24. Brahma said :-- We will give you, too, share in this our Yaj\xc3\xb1a\n(sacrifice); so hear me; do our work and rouse Vi _sn_ u from His sleep.\nDuring the time of performing Homa whatever ghee will fall outside the Homa-\nKund (the sacrificial pit) will fall to your share; so be quick and do this.\n\n\n\n25-30. Suta said :-- Thus ordered by Brahma, the Vamri insect soon ate away\nthe fore end of the bow that rested on the ground. Immediately the string gave\nway and the bow went up; the other end became free and a terrible sound took\nplace. The Devas bcame afraid; the whole universe got agitated; the earth\ntrembled. The sea became swollen; the aquatic animals became startled; violent\nwind blew; the mountains shook; ominous meteors fell. The quarters assumed a\nterrific aspect; the Sun went down the horizon. In that time of distress the\nDevas became anxious what evil might come down. O ascetics! while the Devas\nwere thus cogitating, the head with crown on it of the Devadeva Vi _sn_ u\nvanished away ; no body knew where it fell.\n\n\n\n31-36. When the awful darkness disappeared, Brahma and Mahadeva saw the\ndisfigured body of Vi _sn_ u with its head off. Seeing that headless figure of\nVi _sn_ u they were greatly surprised; they were drowned in the ocean of cares\nand, overwhelmed with grief, began to weep aloud. O Lord! O Master! O\nDevadeva! O Eternal one! what unforeseen extraordinary mishap occurred to us\nto-day! O Deva! Thou canst not be pierced nor cut asunder, nor capable of\nbeing burnt; how is it then that Thy head has been taken away! Is this the\nMaya (majic) of some. Deva? O all pervading one! The Devas cannot live when\nThy condition is thus; we do not know what affection dost Thou have towards\nus. We are crying because of our selfish ends; perhaps this therefore has\noccurred. The Daityas, Yak _s_ as, or Rakh _s_ asas have not done this; O Lord\nof Laksmi! Whose fault will we ascribe this to? The Devas themselves have\ncommitted this loss to themselves?\n\n\n\n37-41. O Lord of the Devas! The Devas are. now dependent! They are under Thee.\nNow where are we to go? What are we to do? There is none to save the dull\nstupid Devas!\n\n\n\nAt this juncture, seeing S\xc2\x92iva and the other Devas crying, Brihaspati,\nsupremely versed in the Vedas, consoled them thus :-- \xc2\x93O highly fortunate one!\nwhat use there will be in thus crying and repenting? it ought you now to\nconsider the means that you should adopt to redress your calamities. O Lord of\nthe Devas! Fate and one's own exertion and intelligence are equal; if the\nsuccess comes not through Fate (Luck or chance) one is certainly to show one's\nprowess and merit\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\np. 15\n\n\n\n42-46. Indra said :-- Fie to your exertion when, before our eyes, the head of\nBhagavan Vi _sn_ u Himself has been carried off! Fie, Fie to your prowess and\nintelligence! Fate is in my opinion, the supreme.\n\n\n\nBrahma said :-- Whatever, auspicious or inauspicious, is ordained Daiva\n(Fate), every one must bear that; no one can go beyond the Daiva. When one has\ntaken up a body, one must experience pleasure and pain; there is no manner of\ndoubt in this. See, in long-past days, by the irony of Fate, S\xc2\x92ambhu severed\nmy head; His generative organ, too, dropped down through curse. Similarly\nHari's head has, to-day, fallen into the salt ocean. By the influence of time,\nIndra, the Lord of Sachi, had thousand genital marks over his body, was\nexpelled from Heaven and had to live in the Manas sarovar in the lotuses and\nhad to suffer many other miseries.\n\n\n\n47-50. O Glorious ones! When such personages have suffered pains, then who\nelse is there in the world, that dues not suffer! so you all cease sorrows and\nmeditate on the Eternal Mahamaya; who is the Mother of all, who is supporter\nof all, who is of the nature of Brahmavidya (the Supreme Knowledge) and who is\nbeyond the Gunas, who is the Prime Prakriti, and who pervades the three Lokas,\nthe whole universe, moving and unmoving; She will dispense our welfare. Suta\nsaid :-- Thus saying to the Devas, Brahma ordered all the Vedas, that were\nincarnate there in their forms, for the successful issue of the Deva's work.\n\n\n\n51-54. Brahma said :-- \xc2\x93OVedas! Now go on and chant hymns to the Sacred\nHighest Devi Mahamaya, who is Brahmavidya, who brings all issues to their\nsuccessful issues, who is hidden in all forms.\xc2\x94 Hearing His words, the all-\nbeautiful Vedas began to chant hymns to Mahamaya who can be comprehended by\nJ\xc3\xb1an, and who pervades the world.\n\n\n\nThe Vedas said :-- Obeisance to the Devi! to the Mahamaya! to the Auspicious\nOne! to the Creatrix of the Universe! We bow down to Thee, who is beyond the\nGunas, the Ruler of all the Beings! O Mother! Thou givest to S\xc2\x92ankara even His\ndesires. Thou art the receptacle of all the things; Thou art the Pra _n_ a of\nall the living beings; Thou art Buddhi, Lak _s_ mi (wealth), S\xc2\x92obha, Ks'hama\n(forgiveness), S\xc2\x92anti (peace), Sraddha (faith), Medha (intellect), Dhriti\n(fortitude), and Smriti (recollection).\n\n\n\n\n\n55\\. Thou art the vindu ( _m_ ) over the Pranava ( _om_ ) and thou art of the\nnature of semi-moon; Thou art Gayattri, Thou art Vyarhiti; Thou art Jaya,\nVijaya, Dhatri (the supportress), Lajja (modesty), Kirti (fame), Ichcha (will)\nand Daya (mercy) in all beings.\n\n\n\n56-57. O Mother! Thou art the merciful Mother of the three worlds; Thou art\n\n\n\np. 16\n\n\n\nthe adorable auspicious Vidya (knowledge) benefitting all the Lokas; Thou\ndestroyest the Universe and Thou skilfully residest (hidden) in the Vija\nmantras. Therefore we are praising Thee. O Mother! Brahma, Vi _sn_ u,\nMahes\xc2\x92vara, Indra, Surya, Fire, Sarasvati and other Regents of the Universe\nare all Thy creation; so none of them is superior to Thee. Thou art the Mother\nof all the things, moving and non-moving.\n\n\n\n58-61. O Mother ! When Thou dost will to create this visible Universe, Thou\ncreatest first Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes'vara and makest them create,\npreserve and destroy this universe; but Thou remainest quite unattached to the\nworld. Ever Thou remainest constant in Thy one form. No one in this Universe\nis able to know Thy nature; nor there is any body who can enumerate Thy names.\nHow can he promise to jump across the illimitable ocean, who cannot jump\nacross an ordinary well.\n\n\n\nO Bhagavati! No one amongst the Devas even knows particularly Thy endless\npower and glory. Thou art alone the Lady of the Universe and the Mother of the\nworld.\n\n\n\n62-68. The Vedas all bear testimony how thou alone hast created all this\nunreal and fleeting universe. O Devi! Thou without any effort and having no\ndesires hast become the cause of this visible world, thyself remaining\nunchanged. This is a great wonder. We cannot conceive this combination of\ncontrary varieties in one. O Mother! How can we understand thy power, unknown\nto all the Vedas even, when thou thyself dost not know thy nature! We are\nbewildered at this. O Mother! It is that thou dost know nothing about the\nfalling off of the Vi _sn_ u's head! Or knowingly thou wanted to examine Vi\n_sn_ u's prowess. Is it that Hari incurred any heinous sin. How can that be!\nWhere is sin to thy followers who serve Thee! O Mother! Why art Thou so much\nindifferent to the Devas! It is a great wonder that the head of Vi _sn_ u is\nsevered! Really, we are merged in great misfortunes. Thou art clever in\nremoving the sorrows of Thy devotees. Why art Thou delaying in fixing again\nthe head on Vi _sn_ u's body.\n\n\n\nO Devi! Is it that Thou taking offence on the gods hast cast that on Vi _sn_\nu! or was it that Vi _sn_ u became proud and to curb that, Thou hast played\nthus! or is it that the Daityas, having suffered defeat from Vi _sn_ u went\nand practised severe tapasya in some beautiful holy place, and have got some\nboons; and so Vi _sn_ u's head has thus fallen off!\n\n\n\nOr is it, O Bhagavati! that Thou wert very eagerly interested to see Vi _sn_\nu's headless body and therefore Thou hast seen thus! O Prime Force! Is it that\nThou art angry on the daughter of the Sindhu (ocean); Laksmi Devi! Else, why\nhast Thou deprived Her of Her husband? Laksmi is born as a part of Thine; So\nThou oughtest to forgive Her offence.\n\n\n\np. 17\n\n\n\nTherefore dost Thou gladden Her by giving back Her husband's life.\n\n\n\nThe principal Devas, engaged in Thy service, always make their Pranams (bow\ndown) to Thee; O Devi! Beest Thou kind enough and make alive the Deva Vi _sn_\nu, the Lord of all and crossest us across this ocean of sorrows. O Mother! We\ncannot make out anything whatsoever where Hari's head has gone. We have no\nother protectress than Thee who canst give back His life? O Devi! Dost Thou\ngive life to the whole world as the nectar gives life to all the Devas.\n\n\n\n69-73. Suta said :-- Thus praised by the Vedas with their Angas, with\nSamaganas (the songs from the Sama Veda), the Nirgu _n_ a Mahes'vari Devi\nMahamaya became pleased. Then the auspicious voice came to them from the\nHeavens, gladdening all, and pleasing to the ears though no form was seen: \xc2\x93O\nSuras! Do not care anything about it; you are immortal (what fear can you\nhave?) Come to your senses. I am very much pleased by the praise sung by the\nVedas. There is no doubt in this. Amongst men, whoever will read this My\nstotra with devotion, will get all what he desires. Whoever will hear this\ndevotedly, during the three Sandhyas, will lie freed from troubles and become\nhappy. When this stotra has been sung by the Vedas, it is equivalent to the\nVedas.\n\n\n\n74-75. Does anything take place in this world without any cause? Now hear why\nHari's head was cut off. Once on a time, seeing the beautiful face of His dear\nwife Laksmi Devi, Hari laughed in presence of Her.\n\n\n\n76-82. At this Laksmi Devi came to understand that \xc2\x93He has seen surely\nsomething ugly in my face and therefore He laughed; otherwise why my Husband\nwould laugh at seeing me. But what reason can there be as to see ugliness in\nmy face after so long a time. And why shall He laugh without seeing something\nugly, without any cause. Or it may be, He has made some other beautiful woman\nas my co-wife\xc2\x94. Thus arguing variously in her mind, Maha Laksmi gradually got\nangry and Tamo guna slowly possessed Her. Then, by turn of Fate, in order that\ngod\xc2\x92s work might be completed, very fierce Tamas Sakti entered into Her body.\nShe got very angry and slowly said :-- \xc2\x93Let Thy head fall off\xc2\x94. Thus, owing to\nfeminine nature and the destiny of Bhagvan, Laksmi cursed without any thought\nof good or bad, causing Her own suffering. By the Tamasi S\xc2\x92akti possessing\nHer, she thought that a co-wife would be more painful than Her widowhood and\nthus She cursed Him.\n\n\n\n83-86. Falsehood, vain boldness, craftiness, stupidity, impatience, over-\ngreediness, impurity, and harshness are the natural qualities of women. Owing\nto that curse, the head of Vasudeva has fallen into the salt ocean. Now I will\n\n\n\np. 18\n\n\n\nfix the head on His body as before. O Sura Sattamas! There is another cause,\nalso, regarding this affair. That will bring you great success. In ancient\ndays a famous Daitya, named Hayagriva practised severe tapasya on the bank of\nthe Sarasvati river.\n\n\n\n87-92. Abandoning all sorts of enjoyments, with control over his senses and\nwithout any food, the Daitya did Japam of the (repeated) one syllabled Maya-\nVija-mantra and, meditating the form of the Utmost Sakti of Mine, adorned with\nall ornaments, practised very terrible austerities for one thousand years. I,\ntoo, went to the place of austerities in My Tamasi form, meditated by the\nDaitya and appeared before him. There, seated on the lion's back, feeling\ncompassion for his tapasya I spoke to him :-- \xc2\x93O glorious One! O one of good\nvows! I have come to grant boon to Thee!\xc2\x94 Hearing the words of the Devi, the\nDaitya instantly got up and falling down with devotion at Her feet,\ncircumambulated Her. Looking at My form, his large eyes became cheerful with\nfeelings of love and filled with tears; shedding tears, then, he began to\nchant hymns to Me.\n\n\n\n93-95. Hayagriva said :-- \xc2\x93Obeisance to the Devi Mahamaye! I bow down to Thee,\nthe Creatrix, the Preserver, and the Destructrix of the universe! Skilled in\nshewing favour to Thy devotees! Giver of the devotee's desires! Obeisance to\nThee! O Thou, the giver of liberation! O Thou! The auspicious one! I bow down\nto Thee. Thou art the cause of the five elements -- earth, water, fire, air,\nand Akasa! Thou art the cause of form, taste, smell, sound and touch. O\nMahes\xc2\x92vari! the five j\xc3\xb1anendriyas (organs of perception) eyes, ears, nose,\ntongue, and skin and the five organs of action Karmendriyas :-- hands, feet,\nspeech, arms, and the organ of generation are all created by Thee.\n\n\n\n96-100. The Devi said :-- \xc2\x93O child! I am very much satisfied with your\nwonderful tapasya and devotion. Now say what boon do you want. I will give you\nthe boon that you desire\xc2\x94. Hayagriva said ;-- \xc2\x93O Mother! grant me that boon by\nwhich death will not come to me, and I be invincible by the Suras and Asuras,\nI may be a Yogi and immortal\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\nThe Devi said :-- \xc2\x93 Death brings in birth and birth brings in death; this is\ninevitable.\xc2\x94 This order of things is extant in this world; never its violation\ntakes place. O best of the Rak _s_ asas! Thus knowing death sure, think in\nyour mind and ask another boon.\n\n\n\nHayagriva said: -- \xc2\x93O Mother of the universe! If it be that Thou art not\nwilling at all to grant me immortality, then grant me this boon that my death\nmay not occur from any other than from one who is horse-faced. Be merciful and\ngrant me this boon that I desire.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n101-105. O highly fortunate one! \xc2\x93Go home and govern your kingdom at your\nease; death won't occur to you from any other beings then from one who is\nhorse-faced.\xc2\x94 Thus granting the boon, the Devi vanished. Becoming very glad on\ngetting this boon, Hayagriva went to his residence. Since then the wicked\nDaitya is troubling very much all the Devas and Munis. There is none in the\nthree worlds to kill him. So let Visvakarma take a horse's head and fix it on\nthe headless body of Visnu. Then Bhagavan Hayagriva will slay the vicious\nwicked Asura, for the good of the Devas\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\n106-112. Suta said :-- Thus speaking to the Devas, Bhagavati S\xc2\x92arvani remained\nsilent. The Devas became very glad and spoke this to Visvakarma :-- \xc2\x93Kindly do\nthis Deva work and fix Visnu's head. He will become Hayagriva and kill the\nindomitable Danava.\xc2\x94 Suta said :-- Hearing these words, Visvakarma quickly cut\noff with his axe, the head of a horse, brought it before the Devas and fixed\nit on the headless body of Visnu. By the grace of Mahamaya, Bhagavan became\nhorse-faced or Hayagriva. Then, a few days after, Bhagavan. Hayagriva killed\nthat proud Danava, the Deva's enemy, by sheer force. Any man, hearing this\nexcellent anecdote, becomes freed, certainly of all sorts of difficulties.\nHearing or reading Mahamaya's glorious deeds, pure and sin destroying, gives\nall sorts of wealth.\n\n\n\nThus ends the fifth chapter of the first Skandha on the description of the\nnarrative of Hayagriva in the Maha Pura _n_ a S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 6](bk01ch06.htm)\n\n"
