In its\nprecise and beautiful language, and in that of the other writings of the Sage,\nwhich are included in this volume, is presented his brilliant synthesis of all\nthat is best in the Upanishads--the _reality_ of Spirit.\n\nAs it was the work of Gautama the Buddha to "scatter broadcast throughout the\nworld the teachings of India\'s Golden Days," so it was the work of\n\xc5\x9aankaracharya to preserve these teachings, to explain them, and to mark them\nwith a spirit and interest which will not die. It was by the reforming and\nrefreshing of the Doctrine instituted by \xc5\x9aankaracharya at a critical time that\nthe Brahmans were enabled to carry forth the sacred flame of knowledge and\nspirituality through dark and difficult centuries.\n\nCharles Johnston, the translator of these writings, is well known to\noccultists as a profound scholar of Oriental language and philosophy. The text\nof this book was published by W. Q. Judge in the Oriental Department Papers of\n1894-6 and in his magazine _The Path_.\n\nTheosophical University Press\n\n|\n\nCovina, California  \n(Covina is crossed out)  \nP.O.
