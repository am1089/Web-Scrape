It was translated into Persian under the title of Kokhenk,\nand has been published in the Bibliotheca Indica, with _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda's\ncommentary and an excellent translation by Professor Cowell.\n\nThough it is called the Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a-upanishad, it does not form\npart of the Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a in 30 adhyayas which we possess, and we\nmust therefore account for its name by admitting that the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, of\nwhich it formed a portion, could be reckoned as part of the Brahma _n_ a\nliterature of the Rig-veda (see Aitareya-ara _n_ yaka, Introduction, p. xcii),\nand that hence the Upanishad might be called the Upanishad of the Brahma _n_ a\nof the Kaushitakins 2.\n\nFrom a commentary discovered by Professor Cowell it appears that the four\nadhyayas of this Upanishad\n\np. xcix\n\nwere followed by five other adhyayas, answering, so far as we can judge from a\nfew extracts, to some of the adhyayas of the Aitareya-ara _n_ yaka, while an\nimperfect MS. of an \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka in the Royal Library at Berlin (Weber,\nCatalogue, p.20) begins, like the Aitareya-ara _n_ yaka, with a description of\nthe Mahavrata, followed by discussions on the uktha in the second adhyaya; and\nthen proceeds in the third adhyaya to give the story of _K_ itra Ga\xe1\xb9\x85gyayani in\nthe same words as the Kaushitaki-upanishad in the first adhyaya. Other MSS.\nagain adopt different divisions. In one MS. of the commentary (MS. A), the\nfour adhyayas of the Upanishad are counted as sixth, seventh, eighth, and\nninth (ending with ityara _n_ yake navamo 'dhyaya _h_ ); in another (MS. P)\nthe third and fourth adhyayas of the Upanishad are quoted as the fifth and\nsixth of the Kaushitakyara _n_ yaka, possibly agreeing therefore, to a certain\nextent, with the Berlin MS. In a MS. of the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka in the\nRoyal Library at Berlin, there are 15 adhyayas, 1 and 2 corresponding to Ait.\n\xc3\x82r. 1 and 5; 3-6 containing the Kaushitaki-upanishad; 7 and 8 corresponding to\nAit. \xc3\x82r. 3 1. Poley seems to have known a MS. in which the four adhyayas of\nthe Upanishad formed the first, seventh, eighth, and ninth adhyayas of a\nKaushitaki-brahma _n_ a.\n\nAs there were various recensions of the Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a (the _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, Kauthuma, &c.), the Upanishad also exists in at least two texts.\nThe commentator, in some of its MSS., refers to the various readings of the\n_S_ akhas, explaining them, whenever there seems to be occasion for it. I have\ngenerally followed the text which is presupposed by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda's Dipika,\nand contained in MSS. F, G (Cowell, Preface, p. v), so far as regards the\nthird and fourth adhyayas. According to Professor Cowell, Vidyaranya in his\nSarvopanishadarthanubhutipraka _s_ a followed the text of the commentary,\nwhile Sankarakarya, if we may trust to extracts in his commentary on the\nVedanta-sutras, followed the other text, contained in MS. A (Cowell, Preface,\np. v).\n\np. c\n\nThe style of the commentator differs in so marked a manner from that of _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara _k_ arya, that even without the fact that the author of the commentary\non the Kaushitaki-upanishad is called _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda, it would have been\ndifficult to ascribe it, as has been done by some scholars, to the famous _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85karananda. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda is called the teacher of Madhava _k_ arya (Hall,\nIndex, p. 98), and the disciple of \xc3\x82nandatma Muni (Hall, Index, p. 116).\n\nI have had the great advantage of being able to consult for the Kaushitaki-\nupanishad, not only the text and commentary as edited by Professor Cowell, but\nalso his excellent translation. If I differ from him in some points, this is\nbut natural, considering the character of the text and the many difficulties\nthat have still to be solved, before we can hope to arrive at a full\nunderstanding of these ancient philosophical treatises.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xcviii:2](sbe01020.htm#fr_67) A Maha-kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a is quoted, but\nhas not yet been met with.\n\n[xcix:1](sbe01020.htm#fr_68) See Weber, History of Sanskrit Literature, p. 50.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V.
