Thou, O Agni, the flaming one, (art born) from\nout the Heavens [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:1:2), thou (art born) from out the\nWaters and the stone (the flint); thou (art born) from out the forests and the\nherbs; thou art born bright, O Lord of men, (as belonging) to men\n[3](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:1:3).\n\n2 [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:2:1). To thee, O Agni, belongs the Hot _ri_ 's and\nthe Pot _ri_ 's office exercised at the appointed season; to thee belongs the\noffice of the Nesh _t_ _ri_ ; thou art the Agnidh [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:2:2)\nfor the righteous. To thee belongs the office of the Pra _s_ ast _ri_ ; thou\nactest as an Adhvaryu, and thou art the Brahman and the master of the house in\nour house [3](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:2:3).\n\n3 [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:3:1). Thou, O Agni, art Indra, a bull among (all)\nbeings. Thou art the wide-ruling Vish _n_ u, worthy of adoration. Thou art the\nBrahman, a gainer of wealth, O Brahma _n_ aspati [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:3:2).\nThou, O Vidhart _ri_ (i. e. who keepest asunder all things), art united with\nPura _m_ dhi (or the Liberality of the gods) [3](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:3:3).\n\n4\\. Thou, O Agni, art the king Varu _n_ a whose laws are firm; thou becomest\nMitra, the wondrous one, worthy of being magnified. Thou art Aryaman, the lord\nof beings, whom I may enjoy [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:4:1). Thou, O god, art A\n_m_ _s_ a [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:4:2), desirous of distributing (goods) in\nthe assembly [3](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:4:3).\n\n5\\. Thou, O Agni, being Tvash _t_ _ri_ , (grantest) to thy worshipper\nabundance in heroes. To thee, who art accompanied by the (divine) wives\n[1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:5:1), who art great like Mitra, belongs relationship\n[2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:5:2). Thou,\n\np. 187\n\nthe quick inciter [3](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:5:3), givest abundance in horses.\nThou, rich in wealth, art the host of men [4](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:5:4).\n\n6\\. Thou, O Agni, art Rudra, the Asura of the high Heaven\n[1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:6:1); thou, being the host of the Maruts, rulest over\nnourishment. Thou goest along with the flame-coloured Winds, bringing\nhappiness to our home. Thou, being Pushan, protectest thy worshippers by thy\nown might.\n\n7\\. Thou, O Agni, art a giver of wealth to him who does service to thee\n[1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:7:1); thou art the god Savit _ri_ , a bestower of\ntreasures. Thou, being Bhaga, O lord of men, rulest over wealth. Thou art a\nprotector in his house to him who has worshipped thee.\n[2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:7:2).\n\n8\\. Towards thee, in the house, the lord of the clan, O Agni, the clans\nstrive, towards thee, the bounteous king. Thou with the beautiful face\npossessest all things. Thou art equal to thousands, to hundreds, to ten (of\nothers).\n\n9\\. Thee, O Agni, men (make) their father by their sacrifices\n[1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:9:1); thee who shinest with thy body they (invite) to\nbrotherhood by their (sacrificial) work. Thou becomest a son to him who has\nworshipped thee. As a kind friend thou protectest against attack.\n\n10\\. Thou, O Agni, art _Ri_ bhu, to be adored when near. Thou rulest over\nstrength [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:10:1), over wealth rich in food. Thou shinest\n[2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:10:2), thou burnest for the sake of giving (wealth).\nThou art a hewer [3](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:10:3), an expander of sacrifice.\n\n11\\. Thou, Agni, O god, art Aditi to the worshipper. Thou, being Hotra Bharati\n[1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:11:1), growest strong by prayer. Thou art I _d_ a,\nliving a hundred winters, for (the increase of) ability. Thou, the killer of V\n_ri_ tra, O Lord of wealth, art Sarasvati [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:11:2).\n\np. 188\n\n12\\. Thou, O Agni, well kept, art the highest vital power. In thy lovely\ncolour and in thy appearance (dwell all) beauties. Thou art great strength\nthat carries us forward. Thou art abundant wealth, extending on all sides.\n\n13\\. The \xc3\x82dityas have made thee, O Agni, their mouth; the bright ones have\nmade thee their tongue, O Sage. The Rati-sa _k_ gods (i. e. the 'bounteous'\ngods) accompany thee at the sacrifices. In thee the gods eat the offering\nwhich is offered to them.\n\n14\\. In thee, O Agni, with (thy) mouth [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:14:1) all the\nguileless [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:14:2) immortal gods eat the offering which\nis offered to them. Through thee the mortals taste their drink. Thou hast been\nborn, the bright one, as the child of the plants.\n\n15 [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:15:1). Thou art united with them and equal to them\nin strength, O well-born Agni, nay, thou surpassest them, O god, when thy\npower [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:15:2) has expanded here in its greatness over\nHeaven and Earth, over both worlds.\n\n16\\. The liberal lords who pour out, O Agni, over thy praisers gifts at the\nhead of which there are cows [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:16:1), the ornament of\nwhich are horses: lead both ourselves and them to welfare. May we speak loud\nin the assembly [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:16:2), rich in valiant men.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is G _ri_ tsamada, the metre _G_ agati.--Verse 1 = VS. XI, 27;\nTS. IV, 1, 2, 5; T\xc3\x82. X, 76, 1; MS. II, 7, 2. Verse 2 = RV. X, 91, 10. Verse 6\n= TS. I, 3, 14, 1; TB. III, 12, 2, 1. Verse 13 = TB. II, 7, 12, 6.\n\np. 189\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Among the numerous texts which treat of the different origins of Agni\n(see Bergaigne, I, 20 seq.), especially the following two verses may be\ncompared with this passage: VI, 48, 5. yam a\xc2\xb4pa _h_ adraya _h_ vana garbham\n_ri_ tasya piprati sahasa ya _h_ mathita _h_ _g_ a\xc2\xb4yate n _r i_bhi _h_ p _ri_\nthivya\xc2\xb4 _h_ adhi sa\xc2\xb4navi; X, 45, 1. diva _h_ pari prathamam _g_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ e\nagni _h_ asmat dviti\xc2\xb4yam pari _g_ ataveda _h_ t _ri_ ti\xc2\xb4yam apsu n _ri_ mana\n_h_ a _g_ asram indhana enam _g_ arate svadhi\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nNote 2. The text (dyubhi _h_ tvam a _s_ u _s_ uksha _n_ i _h_ ) seems to be\ncorrupt. I believe that tvam, which is so frequently repeated through this\nverse and through the next verses, has been put here in the wrong place, and\nthat we should read, dyubhya _h_ a\xc2\xb4 _s_ u _s_ uksha _n_ i _h_.\n\nNote 3. With the last words of this verse, comp. the conclusion of verse 24.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. This whole verse is repeated, X, 91, 10.\n\nNote 2. In my opinion there is no doubt that instead of the traditional\nreading, agnit, the correct form is agni\xc2\xb4t. The word is a compound of agni and\nidh and means 'the inflamer of the fire.' Cf. M. M., Hist. of A. S. L., 1859,\npp. 450, 469.\n\nNote 3. This is the most ancient list of the 'seven priests,' by the side of\nwhom the g _ri_ ha-pati or 'master of the house' is mentioned as the eighth.\nComp. the formula in which the Adhvaryu names the officiating priests,\nKatyayana IX, 8, 8 seq., and see the remarks of Weber, Indische Studien, X,\n141, 376, and my own exposition, Religion des Veda, 383 seq., 396. The\n'Brahman' mentioned in our verse is the Brahma _n_ a _k_ _kh_ a _m_ sin of the\nlater ritual. Comp. Katyayana IX, 8, 11; _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a IV, 6, 6,\n5.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. On verses 3-6, see von Bradke, Dyaus Asura, p. 52 seq.\n\np. 190\n\nNote 2. B _ri_ haspati or Brahma _n_ aspati is the Brahman among the gods. But\nit is doubtful whether the title of Brahman in this connection should be\nunderstood in the later technical sense of the word, as the Ritvi _g_ who has\nto superintend the whole sacrifice. Comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, 396, note\n1.\n\nNote 3. Vidhart _ri_ seems to be here another name of Bhaga; (comp. VII, 41,\n2. bhagam huvema \xe2\x80\xa6 ya _h_ vidharta\xc2\xb4). It is known that no god is so frequently\nmentioned in connection with Pura _m_ dhi as Bhaga. The passages have been\ncollected by Grassmann in his Dictionary, s. v. pura _m_ -dhi.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Prof. von Bradke (Dyaus Asura, 53) believes that the text is corrupt;\nhe thinks that the fourth Pada may have occupied the place of a lost\ncontinuation of the relative clause, yasya sam-bhu _g_ am. I cannot but share\nthe feeling on which Prof. von Bradke's remark rests, though I do not believe\nthat the solution of the difficulty which he proposes is very probable. Could\nnot the correct reading be yasi (instead of yasya) sam-bhu _g_ am, 'thou goest\nto the enjoyment (of goods)?' Comp. VI, 71, 6, where the traditional text has\nvamasya hi kshayasya deva bhu\xc2\xb4re _h_ , and kshayasya doubtless should be\nchanged into kshayasi.\n\nNote 2. On A _m_ _s_ a, as one of the \xc3\x82dityas, comp. Bergaigne, III, 39, 99.\n\nNote 3. Vidathe: comp. the note on I, 31, 6. It is tempting to conjecture\nvidhate (comp. verse 5), but there is no necessity for such a conjecture.\nComp., for instance, VI, 24, 2. vidathe dati va\xc2\xb4 _g_ am.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Gnava _h_ should be read without accent, as Grassmann, Prof. Weber,\nand M. Henry (Revue Critique, Jan. 12, 1891, p. 23) have seen. Cf. Lanman,\n518, 519.\n\nNote 2. The meaning probably is, 'Thou art related to the other gods and to\nmen,' or 'Thou art related to us.' Comp. VIII, 27, 10; 73, 12.\n\np. 191\n\nNote 3. Agni seems to be identified here with Apam napat, who frequently is\ncalled a _s_ u-heman. Comp. Windisch, Festgruss an Roth, 143 seq.\n\nNote 4. The men, of course, are the Maruts, as is shown by the well-known use\nof _s_ ardha _h_ (cf. vol. xxxii, p. 67 seq.).\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Comp. von Bradke, Dyaus Asura, J3 seq.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. As to ara _m_ k _r i_te, cf. VIII, 67, 3.\n\nNote 2. Or, thou art a protector to him who has worshipped thee in his house.\n--Among the various ways for explaining or removing the metrical deficiency of\nthe last Pada the correction dame a\xc2\xb4 (for dame) is recommended by verse 8.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Ish _t_ ibhi _h_ , standing by the side of _s_ amya, seems to be\nderived from the root ya _g_. Thus i _g_ e, i _g_ ana stand by the side of _s_\na _s_ ame, _s_ a _s_ amana.--Cf. ish _t_ ibhi _h_ matibhi _h_ , II, 18, 1.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. The names of the three _Ri_ bhus are _Ri_ bhu, Va _g_ a, Vibhvan. The\nword va\xc2\xb4 _g_ a used here evidently alludes to the second of these names.\n\nNote 2. Bergaigne (Religion Ved., II, 406) no doubt is right in believing that\nthe verb vi bhasi ('thou shinest') alludes to the name Vibhvan. Comp. X, 91,\n1. vibhu _h_ vibha\xc2\xb4va.\n\nNote 3. Vi- _s_ ikshu _h_ again seems to convey an allusion to the _Ri_ bhu\nmyth. When dividing the cup of Tvash _t_ _ri_ into four cups, the _Ri_ bhus\nsay, sakhe vi _s_ iksha (IV, 35, 3). This vi _s_ iksha and the corresponding\nadjective vi- _s_ ikshu should be derived from the root _s_ as, 'to cut to\npieces.'\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Here we have the three goddesses of the \xc3\x82pri hymns, Bharati, I _d_ a,\nand Sarasvati. Of the goddess\n\np. 192\n\n[paragraph continues] Bharati the full name is given, Hotra Bharati, i. e.\n'the Offering of the Bharatas.' Comp. Bergaigne, I, 322 seq.\n\nNote 2. Comp. VI, 6.1, 7, where Sarasvati is called v _r i_traghni\xc2\xb4.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. Or 'through (thee who art their) mouth.'\n\nNote 2. Comp. I, 19, 3. vi _s_ ve deva\xc2\xb4sa _h_ adruha _h_ ; vol. xxxii, pp. 53,\n55.\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. On this verse, compare Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 97.\n\nNote 2. On p _ri_ ksha _h_ , see above, I, 127, 5, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 16.\n\nNote 1. On go-agra, compare Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 51.\n\nNote 2. Vidathe: comp. the note on I, 31, 6.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2](sbe46052.htm)\n\n"
