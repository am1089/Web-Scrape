Vyasa said :-- O King! The messenger of the Danavas having departed,\nIndra, the lord of the Devas, Yama, Vayu, Varu _n_ a, and Kuvera and other\nDevas, called an assembly and addressed thus :-- O Devas! the most powerful\nMahi _s_ a, the son of Rambha, is now the king of the Danavas; he is\nparticularly expert in hundreds of Mayas (magic) and has become haughty on the\nstrength of his boon. O Devas! Mahi _s_ a has sent his messenger; he wants to\ntake possession of the heaven; he came down to me and spoke thus :-- \xc2\x93O Indra!\nQuit your this heaven and go any where you like, or be ready to pay your\nhomage to the highsouled Mahi _s_ asura, the Lord of the Danavas. The Danava\nChief never becomes angry with his opponent who becomes submissive like a\nservant; if you surrender and serve him, he will, out of mercy, grant an\nallowance to you. O Lord of the Devas! If this does not like you, then collect\nyour forces and be ready for fight; no sooner I return, the Lord of the\nDanavas will come here at once ready to give battle to you.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the\nmessenger of that wicked Danava departed. Now what are we to do? O Devas!\nThink on that. O Devas! Even a weak enemy is not to be overlooked by a\npowerful opponent, especially when the enemy is powerful by his own powers and\nis ever energetic, never is he to be overlooked. It is always incumbent on us\nto make our efforts, as best as we can, both by our body and mind as far as\nlies in our power; the result, victory or defeat depends entirely on Fate. It\nis useless to make treaty with a deceitful and dishonest person; we therefore\nnever should make treaty with this person; you are all honest; that Danava is\ndishonest; therefore ponder and ponder deeply and ponder again; do you that\nwhich is proper. It is not advisable to go out at once for fight when we are\nunaware of our enemy's strength; let us therefore send spies truthful, honest,\nmotiveless, quick, to ascertain their strength, those who can easily enter\namongst our enemies and yet who have no relation, nor any interest with them.\nThe arrangements of their forces, their movements, their numbers, they will\nascertain correctly who are their generals, what is their number and what is\ntheir strength, they will thoroughly examine and return here quickly. First,\nwe will ascertain the strength of the forces of our opposite party and then we\nwill decide at once whether we will start for battle or seek protection within\nforts. Wise persons always consider before they act; any act done rashly leads\nin all respects to many troubles, and anything done after mature\n\n\n\np. 364\n\n\n\nprejudgments leads to happiness; so the wise do. The Danavas are all one in\ntheir heart and mind; therefore it is not advisable, in any way to apply the\nprinciple of Bheda (sowing principles of discord). Let our spies go there,\nascertain their strength, return and inform us; we will then judge what\nprinciple is proper and apply to the expert Danavas. Any act done contrary to\npolicy and expediency will undoubtedly produce effects contrary in every way\njust like a medicine which we have not tried already.\n\n\n\n18-22. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus counselling with the Devas; Indra sent\nexpert spies to ascertain the true state of affairs. The spies, too, went into\nthe abode of the Daityas, with no delay and made their searches thoroughly\ninto every nook and corner and returned and told Indra all the strength of the\nDanava forces. Indra was very much startled to know, then, of their\narrangements. He immediately bade all the Devas be ready for battle and called\nfor his High priest Brihaspati, expert in giving advices and began to consult\nwith him how to carry on the warfare with that indomitable enemy, the Lord of\nthe Asuras. On Bhihaspati, the best and famous of the Angira family, taking\nhis excellent seat.\n\n\n\n23-25. Indra thus said :-- \xc2\x93O Guru of the Devas! O Learned! Please say what\nare we to do now in this critical juncture? You are omniscient; to-day you are\nour guide. The Demon Mahi _s_ a has become very powerful, very haughty;\nsurrounded by Danavas he is now coming to fight with us. You are expert in\nmantras; find out the remedy for us. S'ukracharya is the remover of all\nobstacles on their side; and that you are our safe guard is well known to us.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n26\\. Vyasa said :-- Hearing these words of Indra, Brihaspati, who is always\nready to effect the Deva's purposes, thought intently on the subject, said\nvery shortly thus :--\n\n\n\n27-51. Brihaspati spoke :-- O Lord of the Devas! O Venerable One! Be peaceful;\nhave patience; when a difficulty comes, one should not, all on a sudden, lose\none's patience. O Chief of the Immortals! Victory or defeat is completely\nunder the control of destiny: therefore intelligent ones should always be\npatient. O S'atakratu! What will unavoidably be done must come to pass;\nknowing this as certain, one would always be an enthusiast and exert one's\npowers. Everything is guided by Fate. Knowing this, the Munis devote\nthemselves at all times solely filled with energy in their meditation and Yoga\npractices for their final liberation. Therefore, to show one's energy,\naccording to the rules of the daily\n\n\n\np. 365\n\n\n\npractices, ought to be indispensably done; and one should not repel or feel\npleasure on failure or success; for that is under Fate. Success sometimes\ncomes without the exercise of one's own powers, as seen in cases of the lame\nand the blind; and that is not the reason why one should be very glad. The\nembodied beings are all under Daiva (Fate); therefore even if success be not\nattained, though one's own powers are exercised thoroughly, no one is to blame\nfor that. O Lord of the Suras! What to say of forces, Mantras, or advices,\nwhat of chariots or weapons, nothing to lead to success; It is Daiva, and only\nDaiva that makes one successful. This whole universe is under Daiva; it is,\ntherefore, that we see powerful persons suffering pains, and weak ones getting\nhappiness; the intelligent ones sleeping without any food and fools enjoying\nmerrily; distressed persons getting victory and powerful ones suffering\ndefeats; what cares, then ought one to entertain in this. O Lord of the Suras!\nWhatever is inevitable to come to pass, be it success or failure, one will\nlead one's energies to that end; therefore one needs to consider beforehand\nwhether one's energies will be successful or not. In times of distress, one\nsees distress too much and in times of pleasure, one seeks pleasure too much;\none's self, therefore one should not surrender to one's enemies, pleasure and\npain. Pain and suffering is not felt so much in patience as is felt when\nimpatient; therefore one must practise patience when pain or pleasure comes.\nIndeed it is very difficult to bear oneself up in distress or happiness;\ntherefore wise persons try not to let these feelings crop up at all from the\nvery beginning. \xc2\x93I am always full, undiminishable, I am beyond these Prakritic\nqualities. Who is there to suffer? What is suffering?\xc2\x94 Thus one ought to think\nat that moment. I am beyond the twenty-four Tattvas; what pleasure or pain\ncan, then, arise to me? Hunger and thirst are the Dharma of Pra _n_ a; pain\nand insensibility is the Dharma of mind, age and death belong to this physical\nbody. I am free from these six diseases; I am S\xc2\x92iva. Grief and delusion are\nthe qualities of this body what then do I care for them? \xc2\x93I\xc2\x94 am not the\nqualities of the body nor \xc2\x93I\xc2\x94 am the soul pertaining to that. I am beyond the\nseven transfigurations, changes, e. g., Mahat, etc., I am beyond this\nPrakriti, Nature, and beyond the sixteen changes wrought out by Prakriti; I am\ntherefore eternally happy, I am beyond Prakriti and its transformation, then\nwhy am I to suffer pain always? O Lord of the Suras! Think on these and be\nwithout any passion. O S'atakratu! This attachment is the root of all miseries\nand non-attachment is the source of all happiness; non-attachment therefore,\nis the chief means of the extirpation of all your troubles. Lord of S'achi!\nNothing can be happier than contentment. In case you find it difficult to\npractise dispassion, apply, then, discrimination and\n\n\n\np. 366\n\n\n\n\n\nthink of Fate, that what comes inevitably to pass. O Lord of the Suras!\nActions already done cannot die out without their effects being enjoyed. O\nBest of the Suras! Let all your intelligence be brought to action, let all the\nDevas lend their helping hands to you; what is inevitable must come to pass;\nwhat then can you care for your happiness or pain? O King! Happiness is felt\nfor the expiation of good deeds and pain is felt for the expiation of bad\ndeeds; therefore wise persons get thoroughly delighted when their pu _n_ ya\nends. O King! Judge and hold a council to-day; then try your best. But what is\nunavoidable will come to pass, even if you try your best.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the counsels given by Indra\nin the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_\ni Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 5](bk05ch05.htm)\n\n"
