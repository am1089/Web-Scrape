May (this) woman, (herself) begotten in  \nthe proper way, be delivered, may her joints relax, that she shall bring\nforth!  \n2\\. Four directions has the heaven, and also four the earth: (from these) the\ngods created the embryo. May they open her, that she shall bring forth!  \n3\\. May Sushan open: her womb do we cause to gape. Do thou, O Sushan, loosen\nthe womb, do thou, O Bishkala, let go (the ernbryo)!  \n4\\. Attached not at all to the flesh, nor to the fat, not at all to the\nmarrow, may the splotched, moist, placenta come down to be eaten by a dog! May\nthe placenta fall down!  \n5\\. I split open thy vagina, thy womb, thy canals; I separate the mother and\nthe son, the child along with the placenta. May the placenta fall down!  \n6\\.
