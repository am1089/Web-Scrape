Vyasa said :-- On the other hand, there, at the house of Nanda, early in\nthe next morning, commenced the grand birth day festivity. Kamsa came\n\n\n\np. 341\n\n\n\nto know, afterwards, by his spies as will as by general rumour, that at\nGokula, in the house of Nanda, a very joyous festival on a grand scale was\nbeing performed; he also knew before that the other wives of Vasudeva, his\nanimals and his servants were all staying at Nanda\xc2\x92s residence in Gokula.\n\n\n\n3-4. O Bharata! Thus all these gave reasons to Kamsa to suspect the place\nGokula. Especially Narada told him before that the residents, the cowherds at\nGokula, Nanda and others, their wives, Devaki and Vasudeva were all Devas\nincarnates; and consequently they were his enemies.\n\n\n\n5-7. Thus being brought to more confidence by Narada\xc2\x92s words, that vicious\nKamsa, the disgrace to his family, was very angry and sent there his demons\nPutana, Baka, Vatsa, the great Asura, the powerful Dhenuka, Pralamba. They\nwere all killed by Kri _sn_ a, of unsurpassable prowess. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a held\naloft also the hillock Gobardhana (to protect the cow herds and cows, etc.)\nHearing all these, Kamsa became certain also of his own death.\n\n\n\n8\\. Lastly when the evil minded Kamsa heard that the Daitya Kes\xc2\x92i was also\nslain, then he made arrangements for a sacrifice, known as Dhanuryaj\xc3\xb1a; and\nunder this pretext wanted to bring over there at Mathura the two brothers Kri\n_sn_ a and Balarama.\n\n\n\n9\\. The evil minded Kamsa to effect the death of those two, Rama and Kri _sn_\na, of unsurpassable prowess, sent Akrura to Gokula to bring them over to\nMathura.\n\n\n\n10\\. Akrura, the son of Gandini, under the orders of Kamsa, went to Gokula and\nbrought the two boys on a chariot to Mathura.\n\n\n\n11-12. On arriving at Mathura, Rama and Kri _sn_ a first broke the bow; killed\nRajaka, the elephant Kubalaya, Cha _n_ ur, Mu _st_ ika, S\xc2\x92ala, Tos\xc2\x92ala and\nother athletes and warriors. Last of all, Hari, the Lord of the Devas, holding\nKamsa by his hair, killed him with utmost ease.\n\n\n\n13\\. The enemy-destroyer Kri _sn_ a removed the sorrows of his father and\nmother and released them from their prisons and gave over the kingdom of\nMathura to Ugrasena (the father of Kamsa).\n\n\n\n14-15. The high minded Vasudeva, then, with the triple girdle made of Munja\ngrass, performed the Upanayana ceremonies (wearing the sacred thread round the\nbody) of Rama and Kri _sn_ a and made them accept the vow of Brahmacharya.\nThey then departed to the hermitage of the holy Muni S\xc2\x92andipana to acquire\nknowledge. Learning all the vidyas (knowledges) there, they returned quickly\nto Mathura.\n\n\n\np. 342\n\n\n\n16\\. The two sons of \xc3\x82nakadundubhi stayed there and on attaining their twelfth\nyear, became proficient in all the branches of learning and became very\npowerful.\n\n\n\n17\\. That time Jarasandha, being grieved at the killing of his son-in-law\nKamsa, collected a strong and numerous army and marched to Mathura.\n\n\n\n18\\. Seventeen times Jarasandha, the king of Magadha, attacked Mathura and\nseventeen times he was defeated by the ingenuity of that highly intelligent\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, who was of firm resolve and was then residing in Mathura.\n\n\n\n19\\. Lastly, Jarasandha sent the Kalayavana (Black Yavana) to invade Mathura.\nThese Yavanas were brave and the lords of all Mlechchas (untouchables) and\nextremely terrific to the Yadavas.\n\n\n\nNote: Kalayavana - A king of Yavanas and enemy of Kri _sn_ a and an invincible\nfoe of the Yadavas. Kri _sn_ a finding it impossible to vanquish him in the\nfield of battle, cunningly decoyed him to the cave where Muchukunda was\nsleeping who burnt him down.\n\n\n\nYavana means a Greek, an Ionian; then any foreigner, or barbarian (the word is\napplied at present to a Mahomedan or a European also).\n\n\n\n20-21. Hearing that Kala Yavana was coming to attack the Yadavas, Kri _sn_ a\nthe destroyer of Madhu, called all the Yadavas and Baladeva and addressed them\nthus :-- \xc2\x93O blessed ones! Now a cause of great terror has appeared amongst us;\nKala Yavana is being sent by our powerful enemy Jarasandha to attack Mathura.\nNow what to do? It is better to save one\xc2\x92s life by leaving aside all our\nhomes, wealth and army.\n\n\n\n22\\. You should all know that is the place of our fathers and forefathers\nwhere we can safely and happily dwell; where there is a constant source of\nanxiety and uneasiness that, though the place of our fathers and forefathers,\nought to be avoided; never ought anyone to dwell there.\n\n\n\n23\\. If you want to dwell at ease and comfort, you ought to dwell in that\ncountry or place which is adjacent to a sea or a mountain; where there is no\nfear from an enemy, the sages will always remain there.\n\n\n\n24\\. See! The Bhagavan Hari, being afraid, as it were, of his enemy has taken\nrefuge on the body of the thousand headed S\xc2\x92e _s_ a serpent as his sleeping\nplace and is sleeping at ease and comfort on the ocean. It seems likely that\nthe enemy of Tripura, the great S\xc2\x92iva is also dwelling on the Kailas\xc2\x92a\nmountain.\n\n\n\np. 343\n\n\n\n25\\. We, too, are being constantly worried by our enemies here; therefore we\nought not to live here any longer. We should all go to Dwarka city with our\nfriends, relatives and wealth.\n\n\n\n26\\. Garu _d_ a, the king of the birds, has given us the detailed information\nof the city Dwarka. That beautiful city is situated on the sea shore in the\nvicinity of the Raivataka mountain.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n27\\. Vyasa said :-- The Yadava chiefs, hearing S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a\xc2\x92s utterances\nfraught with their welfare, were ready to depart to that place Dwarka,\nattended by their friends, relatives, and appurtenances.\n\n\n\n28\\. They then collected their camels, mares, and buffaloes and filled their\nconveyances with wealth, gems and precious stones and marched out of their\nplace.\n\n\n\n29\\. Rama and Kri _sn_ a went in front; the Yadavas and other subjects then\nmarched in groups (several parties).\n\n\n\n30\\. Marching some days, they all reached Dvaravati. Then the portions of the\ncity that were dilapidated or destroyed, S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a had them repaired by\nengineers, artisans and craftsmen.\n\n\n\n31\\. Placing the Yadavas there, Kes\xc2\x92ava and Baladeva quickly returned to\nMathura and began to stay in that desolated city.\n\n\n\n32\\. The extremely powerful king of the Yavanas arrived then at Mathura. Kri\n_sn_ a knowing that the Yavana chief had come there, went out of the city.\n\n\n\n33\\. The Bhagavan Madhusudana, the destroyer of the boastings of Asuras and\nother people, dressed in yellow robes, appeared on foot before the Kalayavan\nwith smile on his lips.\n\n\n\n34\\. Seeing the lotus-eyed Kri _sn_ a before him, the treacherous Lord of the\nYavanas, pursued him on foot to catch hold of him.\n\n\n\n35\\. Where the powerful Rajar _s_ i Muchukunda was sleeping soundly, the\nBhagavan Hari led Kalayavana there.\n\n\n\n36\\. There S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, saw Muchukunda and vanished away at once; the king\nof the Yavanas on arriving there found the Rajarsi (the royal sage) there in\ndeep sleep.\n\n\n\n37\\. The wicked Yavana mistaking Muchukunda for S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, gave him a\ngood kick. The powerful king Muchukunda got up and was very angry; his eyes\nbecame red and reduced that vicious Yavana instantly into ashes.\n\n\n\n38\\. When Muchukunda burnt the Yavana, he saw the lotus-eyed Kri _sn_ a; he\nbowed down to that Supreme Deva, Vasudeva, and went to forest.\n\n\n\np. 344\n\n\n\n39\\. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a then went back to the city Dwarka with Rama and made\nUgrasena there the king and began to enjoy at his will.\n\n\n\n40\\. At the marriage ceremony of S\xc2\x92is\xc2\x92upala, at the palace of the king of\nVidarbha, Janardan Vi _sn_ u carried away by force Rukmini, the bride elect\nfrom the Svayambara assembly (where the husband is self elected by the bride\nherself) and afterwards married her according to the rule called Rakh _s_ asa\nVidhi (one of the eight forms of marriage in Hindu Law in which a girl is\nforcibly seized and carried away after the defeat or destruction of her\nrelatives in battle).\n\n\n\n41-42. Afterwards He brought also Jambavati, Satyabhama, Mitravinda, Kalindi,\nLak _s_ mana, Bhadra, and auspicious Nagnajiti (the daughter of the king\nNagnajit) on various occasions and married them. O Lord of the earth! These\neight women were the best and most beautiful of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a\xc2\x92s wives.\n\n\n\n43\\. Rukmini first gave birth to the beautiful child Pradyumna and S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a performed the religious ceremony at the birth of his child.\n\n\n\n44\\. Then the powerful Danava named S\xc2\x92amvara stole away the little baby from\nthe lying-in-chamber and carried him to his own city and made him over under\nthe charge of Mayavati.\n\n\n\n45\\. Coming to know that His son had been stolen away, S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a became\nvery much overpowered with sorrow and took the shelter of the Supreme Goddess,\nthe Devi, with a heart full of devotion.\n\n\n\n46-47. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a then began, to chant, in sweet auspicious tone, hymns\nin alphabets, conveying the highest meanings, in adoration of the Yoga Maya,\nWho slew Vritrasura and other Daityas with ease and alacrity.\n\n\n\n48\\. O Mother! I, in my former birth as the son of Dharma, appeased You by my\nascetic practices in the hermitage of Badari and worshipped You with various\nofferings; O Mother! Have you now forgotten all my devotion to You?\n\n\n\n49\\. O Mother! Has any evil minded enemy stolen away my son from the lying-in\nchamber? Or have You Yourself done this to make a fun and see the amusement?\nIt seems that some one of my enemies has done so to insult me; however, You, O\nMother! ought not to put your devotee under this shameful condition.\n\n\n\n50\\. O Mother! This Dwaraka city is well guarded; a very strong fort is built\nin its middle and my place is in the midst of that again; and the lying in-\nchamber is again in the middle; I therefore must say that it is due to my bad\nluck that the child is stolen away!\n\n\n\np. 345\n\n\n\n51\\. O Mother! I did not go to the house of my enemy; the Yadavas also did not\ngo there; this city is guarded by valiant soldiers; then how is it, under what\ncharm, the baby has been stolen? O Mother! Now I come to know that it is due\nto Your Maya; such things are common due to Your Maya in the three worlds.\n\n\n\n52\\. O Mother! When I am ignorant of your deepest mysteries, how can there\nexist anyone among the little minded Jivas that can know your doings? My\nwatchmen could not see anything, where my child was taken away and who has\nstolen it. O Mother! I come to the conclusion that it is hidden behind the\nscreen of Your Maya.\n\n\n\n53\\. O Mother! It is not strange with You; to the chaste woman, Rohi _n_ i\nDevi, though situated at a great distance and not connected with any male\npersons, You, in the fifth month, moved away the son to my knowledge from the\nwomb of my mother; and thus Baladeva was born to Rohini. This is now known to\nall.\n\n\n\n54\\. Mother! You are incessantly creating, preserving, and destroying this\nwhole universe by the mixture of the three qualities. Who can know Your sin-\ndestroying doings? Mother! There is no need of dwelling at length. Suffice it\nto say that You, no doubt, are doing all that are being done in this whole\nuniverse.\n\n\n\n55\\. You first create the joy at the birth of a child; again You load us with\nheavy burdens of sorrows due to the separation from that child; thus you are\nalways sporting; otherwise how my joy at the birth of my child would thus be\nrendered quite useless?\n\n\n\n56\\. The mother of that child is always weeping like an ewe, straying from a\nflock; she is giving vent to her sorrows always to me; O Kind-hearted! Being\nthus endowed with illimitable prowess and understanding, do You not know my\ntroubles! O Mother! You are the only source of consolation to one, suffering\nfrom the sorrows of this world. There is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n57\\. O Goddess! The wise seers say that the birth of a child in any house is\nthe highest bliss there, and the death of a child is the greatest sorrow that\ncan befall to any house. Therefore, O Mother! What shall I do in this? What\nshall I say more than that my heart is going to burst, due to the\ndisappearance of my child.\n\n\n\n58\\. O Mother! I will perform all the necessary sacrifices, take up vows,\nperform all sorts of worship to the entire satisfaction of the Great Fate\n(Ordainer of things); You be pleased to remove my sorrow. O Mother! If my son\nbe alive, kindly shew him once to me. Mother! There is no other than You Who\nis fully capable to destroy this my pain and sorrow, raging in my heart.\n\n\n\np. 346\n\n\n\n59\\. Vyasa said :-- He who brings into practice, things that are considered\nimpracticable for the Devas and removes the load of the Goddess Earth with\nease and alacrity, the same Saviour of world, S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a thus chanted\nhymns in adoration of the Great Goddess. The Devi then became visible to him\nand said.\n\n\n\n60\\. O Lord of the Devas! Do not any longer be sorrowful and miserable; there\nhad been a curse on you before; and, for that reason, the Daitya S\xc2\x92ambara has\nstolen away your son by his demonic magic.\n\n\n\n61\\. Therefore, when your son will grow sixteen years old, then he will, by My\nGrace, kill the Daitya perforce and will return to you. There is no doubt in\nthis.\n\n\n\n62\\. O king! Thus saying these words full of hope and confidence, the Great\nGoddess Chandika, of formidable prowess, disappeared. Kri _sn_ a too, quitted\nhis sorrows, due to the bereavement of his child, and began to spend his time\nin happiness and peace.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-fourth Chapter of the Fourth Book of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa on\nthe stealing away of Pradyumna.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 25](bk04ch25.htm)\n\n'
