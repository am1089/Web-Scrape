Not in (the case of) the third place, as it is thus perceived.\n\nWith regard to third place, the rule of the oblations being five in number\nneed not be attended to for the purpose of obtaining a new body.--Why?--On\naccount of it being perceived thus. That means; because it is seen that the\nthird place is reached in the manner described without any reference to the\noblations being limited to the number five, 'Live and die. That is the third\nplace.'--Moreover, in the passage, 'In the fifth oblation water is called\nman,' the number of the oblations is stated to be the cause of the water\nbecoming the body of a man, not of an insect or moth, &c.; the word 'man'\napplying to the human species only.--And, further, the text merely teaches\nthat in the fifth oblation the waters are called man, and does not at the same\ntime deny that, where there is no fifth oblation, they are not called man; for\nif it did the latter, the sentence would have the imperfection of having a\ndouble sense. We therefore have to understand that the body of those men who\nare capable of ascending and descending originates in connexion with the fifth\noblation, that in the case of other men, however, a body forms itself from\nwater mixed with the other elements even without a settled number of\noblations.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 19](sbe38095.htm)\n\n"
