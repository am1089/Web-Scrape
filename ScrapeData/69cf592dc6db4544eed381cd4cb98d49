And as he walked along\nthe road, the goblin began to talk again: "Bravo, King! You are a remarkable\ncharacter. So I will tell you another story, and a strange one. Listen."\n\n\n\nThere is a city called Flower-city. There lived a king named Earth-boar. In\nhis kingdom was a farm where a Brahman lived whose name was Vishnuswami. His\nwife was named Swaha. And four sons were born to them.\n\nAfter a time the father died, and the relatives took all the money. So the\nfour brothers consulted together: "There is nothing for us to do here. Suppose\nwe go somewhere." And after a long journey they came to the house of their\nmaternal grandfather in a village called Sacrifice. The grandfather was dead,\nbut their uncles sheltered them, and they continued their studies.\n\nBut they did not amount to much, so in time their uncles became scornful in\nsuch matters as food and clothing. And they were troubled.\n\nThen the eldest took the others aside and said: "Brothers, no man can do\nanything anywhere on earth. Now I was wandering about discouraged, and I came\nto a wood. There I saw to-day a dead man whose limbs lay relaxed on the\nground. And I wished for the same fate, and I thought: He is happy. He is free\nfrom the burden of woe.\' So I made up my mind to die, and hanged myself with a\nrope from a tree. I lost consciousness, but before the breath of life was\ngone, the cord was cut and I fell to the ground. And when I came to myself, I\nsaw a compassionate man who had happened by at that moment, and he was fanning\nme with his garment. And he said to me: My friend, you are an educated man.\nTell me why you are so despondent. The righteous man finds happiness, the\nunrighteous man finds unhappiness because of his unrighteousness, and for no\nother reason. If you made up your mind to this because of unhappiness,\npractice righteousness instead. Why seek the pains of hell by suicide?\' Thus\nthe man comforted me and went away. And I gave up the idea of suicide and came\nhere. You see I could not even die when fate was unwilling. Now I shall burn\nmy body at some holy place, that I may not again feel the woes of poverty."\n\nThen the younger brothers said to him: "Sir, why is an intelligent man sad for\nlack of money? Do you not know that money is uncertain as an autumn cloud? No\nmatter how carefully won and guarded, three things are fickle and bring sorrow\nat the last: evil friendships, a flirt, and money. The resolute and sensible\nman should by all means acquire that virtue which brings him Happiness a\ncaptive in bonds."\n\nSo the eldest brother straightway plucked up heart, and said: "What virtue is\nit which we should acquire?"\n\nThen they all reflected, and took counsel together: "We will wander over the\nearth, and each of us will learn some one science." So they appointed a place\nfor meeting, and the four brothers started in four different directions.\n\nAfter a time they all gathered at the meeting-place, and asked one another\nwhat they had learned. The first said: "I have learned a science by which I\ncan take the skeleton of any animal whatever and put the proper kind of flesh\non it."\n\nThe second said: "I have learned a science by which I can put on the flesh-\ncovered skeleton the proper hair and skin."\n\nThe third said: "My science is this. When the skin and the flesh and the hair\nare there, I can put in the eyes and the other organs of sense."\n\nThe fourth said: "When the organs are there, I can give the creature the\nbreath of life."\n\nSo all four went into the forest to find a skeleton and test their various\nsciences. As fate would have it, they found the skeleton of a lion there. And\nthey took that, not knowing the difference.\n\nThe first fitted out the skeleton with appropriate flesh. The second added the\nskin and hair. The third provided all the organs. The fourth gave life to the\nthing, and it was a lion. The lion arose with terrible massive mane, dreadful\nteeth in his mouth, and curving claws in his paws. He arose and killed his\nfour creators, then ran into the forest.\n\nThus the Brahman youths all perished because they did wrong to make a lion.\nWho could expect a good result from creating a bad-tempered creature? Thus, if\nfate opposed, even a virtue that has been painfully acquired does not profit,\nbut rather injures. But the tree of manhood, with the water of intelligence\npoured into its watering-trench of conduct about the vigorous root of fate,\ngenerally bears good fruit.\n\n\n\nWhen the goblin had told this story, he asked the king who was walking through\nthe night: "O King, remember the curse I mentioned, and tell me which of them\nwas most to blame for creating the lion?"\n\nAnd the king reflected in silence: "He wants to escape again. Very well. I\nwill catch him again." So he said: "The one who gave life to the lion, is the\nsinner. The others did not know what kind of an animal it was, and just showed\ntheir skill in creating flesh and skin and hair and organs. They were not to\nblame because they were ignorant. But the one who saw that it was a lion and\ngave it life just to exhibit his skill, he was guilty of the murder of\nBrahmans."\n\nThen the goblin went home. And the king followed him again, and came to the\nsissoo tree.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Twenty-first Goblin: The Old Hermit who exchanged his Body for that of\nthe Dead Boy.
