And on account of the contradiction of the initial statement.\n\nThe Pradhana's being the cause of the world would imply a contradiction of the\ninitial statement, viz. that through the knowledge of one thing all things are\nto be known. Now, on the principle of the non-difference of cause and effect,\nthis initial statement can only be fulfilled in that way that\n\np. 205\n\nthrough the knowledge of the 'Sat', which is the cause, there is known the\nentire world, whether sentient or non-sentient, which constitutes the effect.\nBut if the Pradhana were the cause, the aggregate of sentient beings could not\nbe known through it--for sentient beings are not the effect of a non-sentient\nprinciple, and there would thus arise a contradiction.--The next Sutra\nsupplies a further reason.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 10.
