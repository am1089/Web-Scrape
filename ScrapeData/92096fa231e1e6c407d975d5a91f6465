If it be said that (the word 'seeing') has a secondary (figurative)\nmeaning; we deny this, on account of the word 'Self' (being applied to the\ncause of the world).\n\nThe contention that, because, in passages standing close by, the word 'seeing'\nis used in a secondary sense, the 'seeing' predicated of the Sat ('Being') is\nalso to be taken in a secondary sense, viz. as denoting (not real thought but)\na certain condition previous to creation, cannot be upheld; for in other texts\nmet with in the same section (viz. 'All this has that for its Self; that is\nthe True, that is the Self', _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 7), that which first had been\nspoken of as Sat is called the 'Self'. The designation 'Self' which in this\npassage is applied to the Sat in its relation to the entire world, sentient or\nnon-sentient, is in no way appropriate to the Pradhana. We therefore conclude\nthat, as the highest Self is the Self of fire, water, and earth also, the\nwords fire, &c. (in the passages stating that fire, &c. thought) denote the\nhighest Self only. This conclusion agrees with the text 'Let me enter into\nthese three beings with this living Self, and evolve names and forms', for\nthis text implies that fire, water, &c. possess substantial being and definite\nnames only through the highest Self having entered into them. The thought\nascribed in the text to fire, water, &c. hence is thought in the proper sense,\nand the hypothesis that, owing to its connexion with these latter texts, the\nthought predicated of 'Being' (' _it_ thought,' &c.) should be thought in a\nfigurative sense only thus lapses altogether.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 7.
