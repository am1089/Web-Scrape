Such\na view is clearly negatived by passages such as the following: 'I know that\ngreat person of sun-like lustre beyond darkness; knowing him a man becomes\nimmortal, there is no other\n\np. 130\n\npath to go' ( _S_ vet. Up. III, 8); 'All moments sprang from lightning, the\nPerson--none is lord over him, his name is great glory--they who know him\nbecome immortal' (Mahana. Up. I, 8-11). For the reason that Brahman is\ncharacterised by difference all Vedic texts declare that final release results\nfrom the cognition of a qualified Brahman. And that even those texts which\ndescribe Brahman by means of negations really aim at setting forth a Brahman\npossessing attributes, we have already shown above.\n\nIn texts, again, such as 'Thou art that,' the co-ordination of the constituent\nparts is not meant to convey the idea of the absolute unity of a non-\ndifferenced substance: on the contrary, the words 'that' and 'thou' denote a\nBrahman distinguished by difference. The word 'that' refers to Brahman\nomniscient, &c., which had been introduced as the general topic of\nconsideration in previous passages of the same section, such as 'It thought,\nmay I be many'; the word 'thou,' which stands in co-ordination to 'that,'\nconveys the idea of Brahman in so far as having for its body the individual\nsouls connected with non-intelligent matter. This is in accordance with the\ngeneral principle that co-ordination is meant to express one thing subsisting\nin a twofold form. If such doubleness of form (or character) were abandoned,\nthere could be no difference of aspects giving rise to the application of\ndifferent terms, and the entire principle of co-ordination would thus be given\nup. And it would further follow that the two words co-ordinated would have to\nbe taken in an implied sense (instead of their primary direct meaning). Nor is\nthere any need of our assuming implication (laksha _n_ a) in sentences 1 such\nas 'this person is that Devadatta (known to me from former occasions)'; for\nthere is no contradiction in the cognition of the oneness of a thing connected\nwith the past on the one hand, and the present on the other, the contradiction\nthat arises from difference of place being removed\n\np. 131\n\nby the accompanying difference of time. If the text 'Thou art that' were meant\nto express absolute oneness, it would, moreover, conflict with a previous\nstatement in the same section, viz. 'It thought, may I be many'; and, further,\nthe promise (also made in the same section) that by the knowledge of one thing\nall things are to be known could not be considered as fulfilled. It, moreover,\nis not possible (while, however, it would result from the absolute oneness of\n'tat' and 'tvam') that to Brahman, whose essential nature is knowledge, which\nis free from all imperfections, omniscient, comprising within itself all\nauspicious qualities, there should belong Nescience; and that it should be the\nsubstrate of all those defects and afflictions which spring from Nescience.\nIf, further, the statement of co-ordination ('thou art that') were meant to\nsublate (the previously existing wrong notion of plurality), we should have to\nadmit that the two terms 'that' and 'thou' have an implied meaning, viz. in so\nfar as denoting, on the one hand, one substrate only, and, on the other, the\ncessation of the different attributes (directly expressed by the two terms);\nand thus implication and the other shortcomings mentioned above would cling to\nthis interpretation as well. And there would be even further difficulties.\nWhen we form the sublative judgment 'this is not silver,' the sublation is\nfounded on an independent positive judgment, viz. 'this is a shell': in the\ncase under discussion, however, the sublation would not be known (through an\nindependent positive judgment), but would be assumed merely on the ground that\nit cannot be helped. And, further, there is really no possibility of\nsublation, since the word 'that' does not convey the idea of an attribute in\naddition to the mere substrate. To this it must not be objected that the\nsubstrate was previously concealed, and that hence it is the special function\nof the word 'that' to present the substrate in its non-concealed aspect; for\nif, previously to the sublative judgment, the substrate was not evident (as an\nobject of consciousness), there is no possibility of its becoming the object\neither of an error or its sublation.--Nor can we allow you to say that,\npreviously to sublation, the substrate was non-concealed\n\np. 132\n\nin so far as (i.e. was known as) the object of error, for in its 'non-\nconcealed' aspect the substrate is opposed to all error, and when that aspect\nshines forth there is no room either for error or sublation.--The outcome of\nthis is that as long as you do not admit that there is a real attribute in\naddition to the mere substrate, and that this attribute is for a time hidden,\nyou cannot show the possibility either of error or sublation. We add an\nillustrative instance. That with regard to a man there should arise the error\nthat he is a mere low-caste hunter is only possible on condition of a real\nadditional attribute--e.g. the man's princely birth--being hidden at the time;\nand the cessation of that error is brought about by the declaration of this\nattribute of princely birth, not by a mere declaration of the person being a\nman: this latter fact being evident need not be declared at all, and if it is\ndeclared it sublates no error.--If, on the other hand, the text is understood\nto refer to Brahman as having the individual souls for its body, both words\n('that' and 'thou') keep their primary denotation; and, the text thus making a\ndeclaration about one substance distinguished by two aspects, the fundamental\nprinciple of 'co-ordination' is preserved, On this interpretation the text\nfurther intimates that Brahman--free from all imperfection and comprising\nwithin itself all auspicious qualities--is the internal ruler of the\nindividual souls and possesses lordly power. It moreover satisfies the demand\nof agreement with the teaching of the previous part of the section, and it\nalso fulfils the promise as to all things being known through one thing, viz.\nin so far as Brahman having for its body all intelligent and non-intelligent\nbeings in their gross state is the effect of Brahman having for its body the\nsame things in their subtle state. And this interpretation finally avoids all\nconflict with other scriptural passages, such as 'Him the great Lord, the\nhighest of Lords' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 7); 'His high power is revealed as\nmanifold' (ibid. VI, 8); 'He that is free from sin, whose wishes are true,\nwhose purposes are true' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7, 1), and so on.\n\nBut how, a question may be asked, can we decide, on\n\np. 133\n\nyour interpretation of the text, which of the two terms is meant to make an\noriginal assertion with regard to the other?--The question does not arise, we\nreply; for the text does not mean to make an original assertion at all, the\ntruth which it states having already been established by the preceding clause,\n'In that all this world has its Self.' This clause does make an original\nstatement--in agreement with the principle that 'Scripture has a purport with\nregard to what is not established by other means'--that is, it predicates of\n'all this,' i.e. this entire world together with all individual souls, that\n'that,' i.e. Brahman is the Self of it. The reason of this the text states in\na previous passage, 'All these creatures have their root in that which is,\ntheir dwelling and their rest in that which is'; a statement which is\nillustrated by an earlier one (belonging to a different section), viz. 'All\nthis is Brahman; let a man meditate with calm mind on this world as beginning,\nending, and breathing in Brahman' ( _Kh._ Up. III. 14, 1). Similarly other\ntexts also teach that the world has its Self in Brahman, in so far as the\nwhole aggregate of intelligent and non-intelligent beings constitutes\nBrahman's body. Compare 'Abiding within, the ruler of beings, the Self of\nall'; 'He who dwells in the earth, different from the earth, whom the earth\ndoes not know, whose body the earth is, who rules the earth within--he is thy\nSelf, the ruler within, the immortal. He who dwells in the Self,'&c. (B _ri_.\nUp. III, 7,3; 22); 'He who moving within the earth, and so on--whose body is\ndeath, whom death does not know, he is the Self of all beings, free from sin,\ndivine, the one God, Naraya _n_ a' (Subal. Up. VII, 1); 'Having created that\nhe entered into it; having entered it he became sat and tyat' (Taitt. Up. II,\n6). And also in the section under discussion the passage 'Having entered into\nthem with this living Self let me evolve names and forms,' shows that it is\nonly through the entering into them of the living soul whose Self is Brahman,\nthat all things possess their substantiality and their connexion with the\nwords denoting them. And as this passage must be understood in connexion with\nTaitt. Up. II, 6 (where the\n\np. 134\n\n[paragraph continues] 'sat' denotes the individual soul) it follows that the\nindividual soul also has Brahman for its Self, owing to the fact of Brahman\nhaving entered into it.--From all this it follows that the entire aggregate of\nthings, intelligent and non-intelligent, has its Self in Brahman in so far as\nit constitutes Brahman's body. And as, thus, the whole world different from\nBrahman derives its substantial being only from constituting Brahman's body,\nany term denoting the world or something in it conveys a meaning which has its\nproper consummation in Brahman only: in other words all terms whatsoever\ndenote Brahman in so far as distinguished by the different things which we\nassociate with those terms on the basis of ordinary use of speech and\netymology.--The text 'that art thou' we therefore understand merely as a\nspecial expression of the truth already propounded in the clause 'in that all\nthis has its Self.'\n\nThis being so, it appears that those as well who hold the theory of the\nabsolute unity of one non-differenced substance, as those who teach the\ndoctrine of bhedabheda (co-existing difference and non-difference), and those\nwho teach the absolute difference of several substances, give up all those\nscriptural texts which teach that Brahman is the universal Self. With regard\nto the first-mentioned doctrine, we ask 'if there is only one substance; to\nwhat can the doctrine of universal identity refer?'--The reply will perhaps be\n'to that very same substance.'--But, we reply, this point is settled already\nby the texts defining the nature of Brahman 1, and there is nothing left to be\ndetermined by the passages declaring the identity of everything with Brahman.\n--But those texts serve to dispel the idea of fictitious difference!--This, we\nreply, cannot, as has been shown above, be effected by texts stating universal\nidentity in the way of co-ordination; and statements of co-ordination,\nmoreover, introduce into Brahman a doubleness of aspect, and thus contradict\nthe theory of absolute oneness.--The bhedabheda view implies that owing to\nBrahman's connexion with limiting adjuncts (upadhi) all the imperfections\n\np. 135\n\nresulting therefrom--and which avowedly belong to the individual soul--would\nmanifest themselves in Brahman itself; and as this contradicts the doctrine\nthat the Self of all is constituted by a Brahman free from all imperfection\nand comprising within itself all auspicious qualities, the texts conveying\nthat doctrine would have to be disregarded. If, on the other hand, the theory\nbe held in that form that 'bhedabheda' belongs to Brahman by its own nature\n(not only owing to an upadhi), the view that Brahman by its essential nature\nappears as individual soul, implies that imperfections no less than\nperfections are essential to Brahman, and this is in conflict with the texts\nteaching that everything is identical with Brahman free from all\nimperfections.--For those finally who maintain absolute difference, the\ndoctrine of Brahman being the Self of all has no meaning whatsoever--for\nthings absolutely different can in no way be one--and this implies the\nabandonment of all Vedanta-texts together.\n\nThose, on the other hand, who take their stand on the doctrine, proclaimed by\nall Upanishads, that the entire world forms the body of Brahman, may accept in\ntheir fulness all the texts teaching the identity of the world with Brahman.\nFor as genus ( _g_ ati) and quality (gu _n_ a), so substances (dravya) also\nmay occupy the position of determining attributes (vi _s_ esha _n_ a), in so\nfar namely as they constitute the body of something else. Enunciations such as\n'the Self (soul) is, according to its works, born either (as) a god, or a man,\nor a horse, or a bull,' show that in ordinary speech as well as in the Veda\nco-ordination has to be taken in a real primary (not implied) sense. In the\nsame way it is also in the case of generic character and of qualities the\nrelation of 'mode' only (in which generic character and qualities stand to\nsubstances) which determines statements of co-ordination, such as 'the ox is\nbroken-horned,' 'the cloth is white.' And as material bodies bearing the\ngeneric marks of humanity are definite things, in so far only as they are\nmodes of a Self or soul, enunciations of co-ordination such as 'the soul has\nbeen born as a man, or a eunuch, or a woman,' are in every way\n\np. 136\n\nappropriate. What determines statements of co-ordination is thus only the\nrelation of 'mode' in which one thing stands to another, not the relation of\ngeneric character, quality, and so on, which are of an exclusive nature (and\ncannot therefore be exhibited in co-ordination with substances). Such words\nindeed as denote substances capable of subsisting by themselves occasionally\ntake suffixes, indicating that those substances form the distinguishing\nattributes of other substances--as when from da _n_ da, 'staff,' we form da\n_n_ din, 'staff-bearer'; in the case, on the other hand, of substances not\ncapable of subsisting and being apprehended apart from others, the fact of\ntheir holding the position of attributes is ascertained only from their\nappearing in grammatical co-ordination.--But, an objection is raised, if it is\nsupposed that in sentences such as 'the Self is born, as god, man, animal,'\n&c., the body of a man, god, &c., stands towards the Self in the relation of a\nmode, in the same way as in sentences such as 'the ox is broken-horned,' 'the\ncloth is white,' the generic characteristic and the quality stand in the\nrelation of modes to the substances ('cow,' 'cloth') to which they are\ngrammatically co-ordinated; then there would necessarily be simultaneous\ncognition of the mode, and that to which the mode belongs, i.e. of the body\nand the Self; just as there is simultaneous cognition of the generic character\nand the individual. But as a matter of fact this is not the case; we do not\nnecessarily observe a human, divine, or animal body together with the Self.\nThe co-ordination expressed in the form 'the Self is a man,' is therefore an\n'implied' one only (the statement not admitting of being taken in its primary\nliteral sense).--This is not so, we reply. The relation of bodies to the Self\nis strictly analogous to that of class characteristics and qualities to the\nsubstances in which they inhere; for it is the Self only which is their\nsubstrate and their final cause (prayo _g_ ana), and they are modes of the\nSelf. That the Self only is their substrate, appears from the fact that when\nthe Self separates itself from the body the latter perishes; that the Self\nalone is their final cause, appears from the fact that they exist to\n\np. 137\n\nthe end that the fruits of the actions of the Self may be enjoyed; and that\nthey are modes of the Self, appears from the fact that they are mere\nattributes of the Self manifesting itself as god, man, or the like. These are\njust the circumstances on account of which words like 'cow' extend in their\nmeaning (beyond the class characteristics) so as to comprise the individual\nalso. Where those circumstances are absent, as in the case of staffs,\nearrings, and the like, the attributive position is expressed (not by co-\nordination but) by means of special derivative forms--such as da _nd_ in\n(staff-bearer), ku _nd_ alin (adorned with earrings). In the case of bodies\ndivine, human, &c., on the other hand, the essential nature of which it is to\nbe mere modes of the Self which constitutes their substrate and final cause,\nboth ordinary and Vedic language express the relation subsisting between the\ntwo, in the form of co-ordination, 'This Self is a god, or a man,' &c. That\nclass characteristics and individuals are invariably observed together, is due\nto the fact of both being objects of visual perception; the Self, on the other\nhand, is not such, and hence is not apprehended by the eye, while the body is\nso apprehended. Nor must you raise the objection that it is hard to understand\nhow that which is capable of being apprehended by itself can be a mere mode of\nsomething else: for that the body's essential nature actually consists in\nbeing a mere mode of the Self is proved--just as in the case of class\ncharacteristics and so on--by its having the Self only for its substrate and\nfinal cause, and standing to it in the relation of a distinguishing attribute.\nThat two things are invariably perceived together, depends, as already\nobserved, on their being apprehended by means of the same apparatus, visual or\notherwise. Earth is naturally connected with smell, taste, and so on, and yet\nthese qualities are not perceived by the eye; in the same way the eye which\nperceives the body does not perceive that essential characteristic of the body\nwhich consists in its being a mere mode of the Self; the reason of the\ndifference being that the eye has no capacity to apprehend the Self. But this\ndoes not imply that the body does not possess that essential\n\np. 138\n\nnature: it rather is just the possession of that essential nature on which the\njudgment of co-ordination ('the Self is a man, god,' &c.) is based. And as\nwords have the power of denoting the relation of something being a mode of the\nSelf, they denote things together with this relation.--But in ordinary speech\nthe word 'body' is understood to mean the mere body; it does not therefore\nextend in its denotation up to the Self!--Not so, we reply. The body is, in\nreality, nothing but a mode of the Self; but, for the purpose of showing the\ndistinction of things, the word 'body' is used in a limited sense. Analogously\nwords such as 'whiteness,' 'generic character of a cow,' 'species,''quality,'\nare used in a distinctive sense (although 'whiteness' is not found apart from\na white thing, of which it is the prakara, and so on). Words such as 'god,'\n'man,' &c., therefore do extend in their connotation up to the Self. And as\nthe individual souls, distinguished by their connexion with aggregates of\nmatter bearing the characteristic marks of humanity, divine nature, and so on,\nconstitute the body of the highest Self, and hence are modes of it, the words\ndenoting those individual souls extend in their connotation up to the very\nhighest Self. And as all intelligent and non-intelligent beings are thus mere\nmodes of the highest Brahman, and have reality thereby only, the words\ndenoting them are used in co-ordination with the terms denoting Brahman.--This\npoint has been demonstrated by me in the Vedarthasa _m_ graha. A Sutra also\n(IV, 1, 3) will declare the identity of the world and Brahman to consist in\nthe relation of body and Self; and the Vakyakara too says 'It is the Self--\nthus everything should be apprehended.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[130:1](sbe48031.htm#fr_22) Which are alleged to prove that samanadhikara _n_\nya is to be explained on the basis of laksha _n_ a.\n\n[134:1](sbe48031.htm#fr_23) Such as 'The True, knowledge,' &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Summary statement as to the way in which different scriptural texts are\nto reconciled](sbe48032.htm)\n\n"
