My words can find  \nNo passage to thy stubborn mind.  \nI go, great King, thy task to share,  \nAnd my success attend thee there.'  \n   With that reply and bold consent  \nThe giant king was well content.  \nHe strained Maricha to his breast  \nAnd thus with joyful words addressed:  \n'There spoke a hero dauntless still,  \nObedient to his master's will,  \nMaricha's proper self once more:  \nSome other took thy shape before.  \nCome, mount my jewelled car that flies.  \nWill-governed, through the yielding skies,  \nThese asses, goblin-faced, shall bear  \nUs quickly through the fields of air.  \nAttract the lady with thy shape,  \nThen through the wood, at will, escape.  \nAnd I, when she has no defence,  \nWill seize the dame and bear her thence.  \nAgain Maricha made reply,  \nConsent and will to signify.  \nWith rapid speed the giants two  \nFrom the calm hermit dwelling flew,  \nBorne in that wondrous chariot, meet  \nFor some great God's celestial seat.  \nThey from their airy path looked down  \nOn many a wood and many a town,  \nOn lake and river, brook and rill,  \nCity and realm and towering hill.  \nSoon he whom giant hosts obeyed,  \nMaricha by his side, surveyed  \nThe dark expanse of Dandak wood  \nWhere Rama s hermit cottage stood.  \nThey left the flying car, whereon  \nThe wealth of gold and jewels shone,  \nAnd thus the giant king addressed  \nMaricha as his hand he pressed:  \n   'Maricha, look! before our eyes  \nRound Rama's home the plantains rise.  \nHis hermitage is now in view:  \nQuick to the work we came to do!'  \n   Thus Ravan spoke, Maricha heard  \nObedient to his master's word,  \nThrew off his giant shape and near  \nThe cottage strayed a beauteous deer.  \nWith magic power, by rapid change.  \nHis borrowed form was fair and strange.  \nA sapphire tipped each horn with light;  \nHis face was black relieved with white.  \nThe turkis and the ruby shed  \nA glory from his ears and head.  \nHis arching neck was proudly raised,  \nAnd lazuares* beneath it blazed.  \nWith roseate bloom his flanks were dyed,  \nAnd lotus tints adorned his hide.  \nHis shape was fair*, compact*, and slight;  \n\np. 278  \n\nHis hoofs--were carven lazulite.  \nHis tail with every changing glow  \nDisplayed the hues of Indra's bow.  \nWith glossy skin so strangely flecked,  \nWith tints of every gem bedecked.  \nA light o'er Rama's home he sent,  \nAnd through the wood, where'er he went.  \nThe giant clad in that strange dress  \nThat took the soul with loveliness,  \nTo charm the fair Videhan's eyes  \nWith mingled wealth of mineral dyes,  \nMoved onward, cropping in his way,  \nThe grass and grain and tender spray,  \nHis coat with drops of silver bright,  \nA form to gaze on with delight,  \nHe raised his fair neck as he went  \nTo browse on bud and filament.  \nNow in the Cassia grove he strayed,  \nNow by the cot in plantains' shade.  \nSlowly and slowly on he came  \nTo catch the glances of the dame,  \nAnd the tall deer of splendid hue  \nShone full at length in Sita's view.  \nHe roamed where'er his fancy chose  \nWhere Rama's leafy cottage rose.  \nNow near, now far, in careless ease,  \nHe came and went among the trees.  \nNow with light feet he turned to fly,  \nNow, reassured, again drew nigh:  \nNow gambolled close with leap and bound,  \nNow lay upon the grassy ground:  \nNow sought the door, devoid of fear,  \nAnd mingled with the troop of deer;  \nLed them a little way, and thence  \nAgain returned with confidence.  \nNow flying far, now turning back  \nEmboldened on his former track,  \nSeeking to win the lady's glance  \nHe wandered through the green expanse.  \nThen thronging round, the woodland deer  \nGazed on his form with wondering fear;  \nA while they followed where he led,  \nThen snuffed the tainted gale and fled.  \nThe giant, though he longed to slay  \nThe startled quarry, spared the prey,  \nAnd mindful of the shape he wore  \nTo veil his nature, still forbore.  \nThen Sita of the glorious eye,  \nReturning from her task drew nigh;  \nFor she had sought the wood to bring  \nEach loveliest flower of early spring.  \nNow would the bright-eyed lady choose  \nSome gorgeous bud with blending hues,  \nNow plucked the mango's spray, and now  \nThe bloom from an As'oka bough.  \nShe with her beauteous form, unmeet  \nFor woodland life and lone retreat,  \nThat wondrous dappled deer beheld  \nGemmed with rich pearls, unparalleled,  \nHis silver hair the lady saw,  \nHis radiant teeth and lips and jaw,  \n\nAnd gazed with rapture as her eyes  \nExpanded in their glad surprise.  \nAnd when the false deer's glances fell  \nOn her whom Rama loved so well,  \nHe wandered here and there, and cast  \nA luminous beauty as be passed;  \nAnd Janak's child with strange delight  \nKept gazing on the unwonted sight.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLIII.: The Wondrous Deer.](ry241.htm)\n\n"
