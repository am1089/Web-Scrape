Everywhere; because there is taught what is known.\n\nWe read in the _Kh_ andogya, \'Man is made of thought; according to what his\nthought is in this world, so will he be when he has departed this life. Let\nhim form this thought: he who consists of mind, whose body is breath, whose\nform is light,\' &c. (III, 14). We here understand that of the meditation\nenjoined by the clause \'let him form this thought\' the object is the being\nsaid to consist of mind, to have breath for its body, &c. A doubt, however,\narises whether the being possessing these attributes be the individual soul or\nthe highest Self.--The Purvapakshin maintains the former alternative. For, he\nsays, mind and breath are instruments of the individual soul; while the text\n\'without breath, without mind,\' distinctly denies them to the highest Self.\nNor can the Brahman mentioned in a previous clause of the same section (\'All\nthis indeed is Brahman\') be connected as an object with the meditation\nenjoined in the passage under discussion; for Brahman is there referred to in\norder to suggest the idea of its being the Self of all--which idea constitutes\na means for bringing about that calmness of mind which is helpful towards the\nact of meditation enjoined in the clause \'Let a man meditate with calm mind,\'\n&c. Nor, again, can it be said that as the meditation conveyed by the clause\n\'let him form this thought\' demands an object, Brahman, although mentioned in\nanother passage, only admits of being connected with\n\np. 258\n\nthe passage under discussion; for the demand for an object is fully satisfied\nby the being made of mind, &c., which is mentioned in that very passage\nitself; in order to supply the object we have merely to change the case-\nterminations of the words \'manomaya _h_ pra _n_ a _s_ arira _h_ ,\' &c. It\nhaving thus been determined that the being made of mind is the individual\nsoul, we further conclude that the Brahman mentioned in the concluding passage\nof the section (\'That is Brahman\') is also the individual soul, there called\nBrahman in order to glorify it.\n\nThis prima facie view is set aside by the Sutra. The being made of mind is the\nhighest Self; for the text states certain qualities, such as being made of\nmind, &c., which are well known to denote, in all Vedanta-texts, Brahman only.\nPassages such as \'He who is made of mind, the guide of the body of breath\'\n(Mu. Up. II, 2, 7); \'There is the ether within the heart, and in it there is\nthe Person, consisting of mind, immortal, golden\' (Taitt. Up. I. 6, 1); \'He is\nconceived by the heart, by wisdom, by the mind. Those who know him are\nimmortal\' (Ka. Up. II, 6, 9); \'He is not apprehended by the eye nor by speech,\nbut by a purified mind\' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 8); \'The breath of breath\' (B _ri_.\nUp. IV, 4, 183); \'Breath alone is the conscious Self, and having laid hold of\nthis body it makes it rise up\' (Kau. Up. III, 3); \'All these beings merge into\nbreath alone, and from breath they arise\' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 11, 5)--these and\nsimilar texts refer to Brahman as consisting of mind, to be apprehended by a\npurified mind, having breath for its body, and being the abode and ruler of\nbreath. This being so, we decide that in the concluding passage, \'my Self\nwithin the heart, that is Brahman,\' the word \'Brahman\' has to be taken in its\nprimary sense (and does not denote the individual soul). The text which\ndeclares Brahman to be without mind and breath, merely means to deny that the\nthought of Brahman depends on a mind (internal organ), and that its life\ndepends on breath.\n\nOr else we may interpret the Vedic text and the Sutra as follows. The passage\n\'All this is Brahman; let a man\n\np. 259\n\nmeditate with a calm mind on this world as originating, ending, and breathing\nin Brahman,\' conveys the imagination of meditation on Brahman as the Self of\nall. The subsequent clause \'Let him form the thought,\' &c., forms an\nadditional statement to that injunction, the purport of which is to suggest\ncertain attributes of Brahman, such as being made of mind. So that the meaning\nof the whole section is \'Let a man meditate on Brahman, which is made of mind,\nhas breath for its body, &c., as the Self of the whole world.\'--Here a doubt\npresents itself. Does the term \'Brahman\' in this section denote the individual\nsoul or the highest Self?--The individual soul, the Purvapakshin maintains,\nfor that only admits of being exhibited in co-ordination with the word \'all.\'\nFor the word \'all\' denotes the entire world from Brahma down to a blade of\ngrass; and the existence of Brahma and other individual beings is determined\nby special forms of karman, the root of which is the beginningless Nescience\nof the individual soul. The highest Brahman, on the other hand, which is all-\nknowing, all-powerful, free from all evil and all shadow of Nescience and\nsimilar imperfections, cannot possibly exist as the \'All\' which comprises\nwithin itself everything that is bad. Moreover we find that occasionally the\nterm \'Brahman\' is applied to the individual soul also; just as the highest\nLord (paramesvara) may be called \'the highest Self\' (paramatman) or \'the\nhighest Brahman.\' That \'greatness\' (b _ri_ hattva; which is the essential\ncharacteristic of \'brahman\') belongs to the individual soul when it has freed\nitself from its limiting conditions, is moreover attested by scripture: \'That\n(soul) is fit for infinity\' ( _S_ vet. Up. V, 9). And as the soul\'s Nescience\nis due to karman (only), the text may very well designate it--as it does by\nmeans of the term \'ta _gg_ alan\'--as the cause of the origin, subsistence, and\nreabsorption of the world. That is to say--the individual soul which, in its\nessential nature, is non-limited, and therefore of the nature of Brahman,\nowing to the influence of Nescience enters into the state of a god, or a man,\nor an animal, or a plant.\n\nThis view is rejected by the Sutra. \'Everywhere,\' i.e.\n\np. 260\n\nin the whole world which is referred to in the clause \'All this is Brahman\' we\nhave to understand the highest Brahman--which the term \'Brahman\' denotes as\nthe Self of the world--, and not the individual soul; \'because there is taught\nwhat is known,\' i.e. because the clause \'All this is Brahman\'--for which\nclause the term \'ta _gg_ alan\' supplies the reason--refers to Brahman as\nsomething generally known. Since the world springs from Brahman, is merged in\nBrahman, and depends on Brahman for its life, therefore--as the text\nsays--\'All this has its Self in Brahman\'; and this shows to us that what the\ntext understands by Brahman is that being from which, as generally known from\nthe Vedanta texts, there proceed the creation, and so on, of the world. That\nthe highest Brahman only, all-wise and supremely blessed, is the cause of the\norigin, &c., of the world, is declared in the section which begins. \'That from\nwhich these beings are born,\' &c., and which says further on, \'he knew that\nBliss is Brahman, for from bliss these beings are born\' (Taitt. Up. III, 6);\nand analogously the text \'He is the cause, the lord of lords of the organs,\'\n&c. ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 9), declares the highest Brahman to be the cause of the\nindividual soul. Everywhere, in fact, the texts proclaim the causality of the\nhighest Self only. As thus the world which springs from Brahman, is merged in\nit, and breathes through it, has its Self in Brahman, the identity of the two\nmay properly be asserted; and hence the text--the meaning of which is \'Let a\nman meditate with calm mind on the highest Brahman of which the world is a\nmode, which has the world for its body, and which is the Self of the world\'--\nfirst proves Brahman\'s being the universal Self, and then enjoins meditation\non it. The highest Brahman, in its causal condition as well as in its so-\ncalled \'effected\' state, constitutes the Self of the world, for in the former\nit has for its body all sentient and non-sentient beings in their subtle form,\nand in the latter the same beings in their gross condition. Nor is there any\ncontradiction between such identity with the world on Brahman\'s part, and the\nfact that Brahman treasures within itself glorious qualities antagonistic to\nall evil; for the\n\np. 261\n\nimperfections adhering to the bodies, which are mere modes of Brahman, do not\naffect Brahman itself to which the modes belong. Such identity rather proves\nfor Brahman supreme lordly power, and thus adds to its excellences. Nor,\nagain, can it rightly be maintained that of the individual soul also identity\nwith the world can be predicated; for the souls being separate according to\nthe bodies with which they are joined cannot be identical with each other.\nEven in the state of release, when the individual soul is not in any way\nlimited, it does not possess that identity with the world on which there\ndepends causality with regard to the world\'s creation, sustentation, and\nreabsorption; as will be declared in Sutra IV, 4, 17. Nor, finally, does the\nPurvapakshin improve his case by contending that the individual soul may be\nthe cause of the creation. &c., of the world because it (viz. the soul) is due\nto karman; for although the fact given as reason is true, all the same the\nLord alone is the cause of the Universe.--All this proves that the being to\nwhich the text refers as Brahman is none other than the highest Self.\n\nThis second alternative interpretation of the Sutra is preferred by most\ncompetent persons. The V _ri_ ttikara, e.g. says, \'That Brahman which the\nclause "All this is Brahman" declares to be the Self of all is the Lord.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
