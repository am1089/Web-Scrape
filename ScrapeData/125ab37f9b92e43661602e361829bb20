[1885], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n4:3:4\n\n### FOURTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n4:3:4:11\\. Now, they slay the sacrifice, when they spread (perform) it:--to\nwit, when they press out the king (Soma), they slay him; when they quiet the\nvictim, they slay it; and with mortar and pestle, with the upper and nether\nmillstone, they slay the havis offering.\n\n4:3:4:22\\. When slain, that sacrifice was no longer vigorous. By means of\ndakshi _n_ as (gifts to the priests) the gods invigorated it: hence the name\ndakshi _n_ a, because thereby they invigorated (dakshay) it. Whatever,\ntherefore, fails in this sacrifice, when slain, that he now invigorates by\nmeans of gifts to the priests; then the sacrifice becomes indeed successful:\nfor this reason he makes gifts to the priests.\n\n4:3:4:33\\. Now at the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, indeed, they give as little as six or\ntwelve (cows 1), but no Soma-sacrifice should have dakshi _n_ as of less than\na hundred. For\n\np. 341\n\nhe, Pra _g_ apati 1, forsooth, is the visible sacrifice; and man is nearest to\nPra _g_ apati, and he has a life of a hundred years, a hundred powers, a\nhundred energies. Only by a hundred he invigorates him, and not by less than a\nhundred: wherefore no Soma-sacrifice should have dakshi _n_ as of less than a\nhundred; nor should any one officiate as a priest for a sacrificer at a (Soma-\nsacrifice) where less than a hundred are given,--'lest he should be an\neyewitness when they will but slay and not invigorate him (Soma).'\n\n4:3:4:44\\. Now, truly, there are two kinds of gods; for the gods, forsooth,\nare the gods; and the learned Brahmans versed in sacred lore are the human\ngods. And the sacrifice to them is twofold, oblations (being the sacrifice) to\nthe gods, and gifts to the priests being that to the human gods, to the\nlearned Brahmans versed in sacred lore. With oblations, forsooth, one\ngratifies the gods, and with gifts to the priests the human gods, the learned\nBrahmans versed in sacred lore. These two kinds of gods, when gratified,\nconvey him to the heavenly world.\n\n4:3:4:55\\. But it is to the officiating priests, forsooth, that these gifts of\nhis belong, for they prepare him another self,--to wit, this sacrifice,\nconsisting of _Ri_ _k_ and Ya _g_ us and Saman and oblations,--that becomes\nhis self in yonder world: 'It is they that have generated me,' from this\n(consideration) he should give the gifts to officiating priests and not to\nnon-officiating.\n\n4:3:4:66\\. Having gone back to the Garhapatya fire 2, he\n\np. 342\n\noffers the gift offerings. Having tied a piece of gold in a fringed cloth 1,\nand laid it (into the spoon), he offers. 'May there be a place for me in the\nworld of the gods!' With this hope he offers whoever offers: that same\nsacrifice of his goes to the world of the gods; and behind it goes the gift he\ngives to the priests, and holding on to the gift follows the sacrificer.\n\n4:3:4:77\\. Now, there are four (kinds of) gifts to priests,--gold, the cow,\ncloth, and the horse. But it is not proper that he should lay a horse's foot\nor a cow's foot (into the spoon): hence he ties up a piece of gold in a\nfringed cloth, and having laid it (into the spoon) he offers.\n\n4:3:4:88\\. He offers with two verses to the Sun. For yonder world is shut off\nby darkness; and dispelling the darkness by that light he reaches the heavenly\nworld: therefore he offers with two verses to the Sun.\n\n4:3:4:99\\. He offers with this gayatri verse (Va _g_. S. VII, 41; Rig-veda I,\n50, 1), 'The lights bear on high that divine knower of beings, Surya, that all\nmay see him,--Hail!'--for the gayatri is this earth, and she is a safe\nresting-place hence he thereby stands firmly on this safe resting-place.\n\n4:3:4:1010\\. He then makes the second offering with this trish _t_ ubh verse\n(Va _g_. S. VII, 42; Rig-veda I, 115, I), 'The brilliant front 2 of the gods\nhath risen,\n\np. 343\n\nthe eye of Mitra, Varu _n_ a, and Agni: Surya, the soul of the movable and\nimmovable, hath filled the heaven and the earth and the air,--Hail!' whereby\nhe approaches the world (of the gods).\n\n4:3:4:1111\\. He then makes either one or two oblations on the \xc3\x82gnidhra (fire).\nThe reason why he makes one or two oblations on the \xc3\x82gnidhra fire is that Agni\nrules over beasts (cattle) 1, and they lie round about him on every side: it\nis him he pleases by this oblation, and thus pleased he is gracious unto this\n(sacrificer), and the latter offers (to the priests a cow) graciously given up\nby him (Agni).\n\n4:3:4:1212\\. He offers with (Va _g_. S. VII, 43; Rig-veda I, 189, 1), 'O Agni,\nlead us on a good path unto wealth; thou, O god, that knowest all works! keep\nthou from us the sin that leadeth astray, and we will offer unto thee most\nample adoration,'\\--'Hail!' Thereupon, if he intends to give away a horse,\nharnessed or unharnessed, let him make a second oblation; but if not, he need\nnot attend to this.\n\n4:3:4:1313\\. He offers with (Va _g_. S. VII, 44), 'May this Agni make wide\nroom for us: may he march in front smiting the haters! May he gain riches in\nthe winning of riches: may he, fiercely rushing, conquer the enemies! Hail!'\nfor the horse is a winner of riches (spoils, prizes).\n\n4:3:4:1414\\. Thereupon, taking some gold, (the sacrificer)\n\np. 344\n\ngoes to the hall. South of the altar stand the Dakshi _n_ a (cows). Standing\nin front of the hall, he respectfully addresses them 1 with (Va _g_. S. VII,\n45), 'By your beauty have I come to beauty.' Now at first cattle did not\nsubmit to being given away. Laying aside their own beauteous forms 2 they\napproached with their (bare) bodies. The gods then went up to them from the\noffering ground with their (the animals') own forms; and they, knowing their\nown forms, resigned themselves and became well-disposed to being given away.\nAnd in like manner does he now go up to them from the offering ground with\ntheir own forms; and they, knowing their own forms, resign themselves and\nbecome well-disposed to being given away.\n\n4:3:4:1515\\. 'May the all-knowing Tutha distribute you!'--Now, Tutha is the\nBrahman: he thus distributes them by means of the Brahman. And the Brahman\nknows who is fit to receive a dakshi _n_ a and who is unfit: thus these (cows)\nof his are given away only to him who is fit to receive a dakshi _n_ a and not\nto him who is unfit.\n\n4:3:4:1616\\. 'Go ye forward in the way of truth,'--for whosoever walks in the\nway of the gods, walks in the way of truth;--'ye of shining ( _k_ andra)\ngifts!' whereby they walk with that light ( _k_ andra, the moon).\n\np. 345\n\n4:3:4:1717\\. He then goes to the Sadas, saying, 'Behold thou the heaven,\nbehold the air!' whereby he means to say, 'May I through thee, the dakshi _n_\na, see the (heavenly) world.'\n\n4:3:4:1818\\. Thereupon he looks on the Sadas, with, 'Unite with the Sadas-\npriests!' whereby he means to say, 'May the Sadas-priests not go beyond thee!'\n\n4:3:4:1919\\. He then takes the gold and goes up to the \xc3\x82gnidhra (fire-house),\nsaying (Va _g_. S. VII, 46), 'May I this day obtain a Brahman who has a father\nand forefathers!'--for he who is renowned and of renowned family, is one who\nhas a father and forefathers; and by the gifts which he gives to a renowned\n(priest), though they be but few, he gains great things.--'A _Ri_ shi, the\nscion of _Ri_ shis,' for he who is renowned as learned in sacred lore, is a\n_Ri_ shi, the scion of _Ri_ shis;--'of well-bestowed gifts,' for he indeed is\none on whom gifts are well-bestowed.\n\n4:3:4:2020\\. Having thus respectfully sat down by the Agnidh, he gives him the\ngold, with 'Given (rata) by us, go ye to the gods!'--for whatever sacrificial\ngift he gives unhesitatingly, with a liberal (rata) mind, thereby he gains\ngreat things, 'Go ye to the gods,' he says, for he who sacrifices, sacrifices\nwith the hope, 'May there be a place for me in the world of the gods;' and he\nthus makes him a sharer in the world of the gods.--'Enter ye to the Giver!'\nwhereby he means to say, 'Enter ye into me!' and thus those (cows) 1 do not\nget lost to him. And as to his giving\n\np. 346\n\na dakshi _n_ a first to the Agnidh, it was from thence (from the \xc3\x82gnidhra) 1\nthat all the gods gained immortality: therefore he gives the dakshi _n_ a\nfirst to the Agnidh.\n\n4:3:4:2121\\. Then, approaching in the same way, he gives some gold to an\n\xc3\x82treya 2. For, at the time 3 when they recite the morning prayer, they were\nonce upon a time singing praises here in front 4. Now Atri was the Hot _ri_ of\nthe _Ri_ shis. Then the darkness of the Asuras came rushing into the Sadas.\nThe _Ri_ shis said to Atri, 'Come back here, and dispel this darkness!' He\ndispelled that darkness; and thinking, 'He indeed is the light who has\ndispelled this darkness,' they brought him this light, gold, for a sacrificial\ngift,--for gold is indeed light; and by that same splendour and energy the\n_Ri_ shi dispelled the darkness. And so does he now also dispel the darkness\nby that light: therefore he bestows gold on an \xc3\x82treya.\n\np. 347\n\n4:3:4:2222\\. Then to the Brahman, for the Brahman watches over the sacrifice\nfrom the south. Then to the Udgat _ri_ (chanter); then to the Hot _ri_ ; then\nto the two Adhvaryus, seated in the cart-shed. Then, having returned (to the\nSadas he presents gold) to the Prastot _ri_ ; then to the Maitravaru _n_ a;\nthen to the Brahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin; then to the Pot _ri_ ; then to the\nNesh _t_ _ri_ ; then to the A _kh_ avaka; then to the Unnet _ri_ ; then to the\nGravastut; then to the Subrahma _n_ ya. To the Pratihart _ri_ he presents it\nlast, since he is the restrainer(pratihart _ri_ ) 1: he thus in the end\nrestrains (the cows) for him, and so they do not become lost to him.\n\n4:3:4:2323\\. Thereupon he (the Adhvaryu) says (to the Maitravaru _n_ a),\n'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Indra, followed by the Maruts!' Now when,\nin the beginning, Pra _g_ apati gave gifts, Indra thought within himself,\n'Everything here, forsooth, he will give away, and not anything will he leave\nfor us.' He then, to stop the giving, raised up that thunderbolt 'Recite to\nIndra Marutvat!' and thereafter he (Pra _g_ apati) gave no more. And in like\nmanner is that thunderbolt 'Recite to Indra Marutvat!' now raised up to stop\nthe giving, and thereafter he (the sacrificer) gives no more.\n\n4:3:4:2424; There are, then, four (kinds of) sacrificial gifts: Gold--thereby\nindeed he preserves his own life, for gold is life. That he (Pra _g_ apati or\nVaru _n_ a) gave\n\np. 348\n\nto Agni, performing the office of the Agnidh (fire-kindler): wherefore now\nalso gold is given to the Agnidh.\n\n4:3:4:2525\\. Then the Cow--thereby he preserves his own breath, for the cow is\nbreath, since the cow is food, and breath also is food: her he gave to Rudra,\nthe Hot _ri_.\n\n4:3:4:2626\\. Then Cloth--thereby he preserves his own skin, for the cloth is\nskin: this he gave to B _ri_ haspati, who chanted.\n\n4:3:4:2727\\. Then the Horse--for the horse is a thunderbolt: he thereby makes\nthe thunderbolt the leader. And, moreover, he who sacrifices, sacrifices with\nthe hope 'May there be a place for me in Yama's world!' He thus makes him a\nsharer in Yama's world. This he gave to Yama, the Brahman.\n\n4:3:4:2828\\. The (proffered) gold he (the Adhvaryu) goes to meet (accepts)\nwith (Va _g_. S. VII, 47), 'Let Varu _n_ a give thee to me (who am) Agni!' for\nto Agni Varu _n_ a gave it. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou life to the\ngiver, joy (mayas) to me, the receiver!'\n\n4:3:4:2929\\. And the cow he accepts with, 'Let Varu _n_ a give thee to me,\nRudra!' for to Rudra Varu _n_ a gave her. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou\nbreath to the giver, strength (vayas) to me, the receiver!'\n\n4:3:4:3030\\. And the cloth he accepts with, 'Let Varu _n_ a give thee to me, B\n_ri_ haspati!' for to B _ri_ haspati Varu _n_ a gave it. 'May I obtain\nimmortality! be thou a skin to the giver, joy to me, the receiver!'\n\n4:3:4:3131\\. And the horse he accepts with, 'Let Varu _n_ a give thee to me,\nYama!' for to Yama Varu _n_ a\n\np. 349\n\ngave it. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou a steed (haya _h_ ) to the giver,\nstrength (vayas) to me, the receiver!'\n\n4:3:4:3232\\. And whatever other gift he gives that he gives with the hope,\n'May I also have this in yonder world!' That he accepts with (Va _g_. S. VII,\n48), 'Who hath given it? to whom hath he given it? Hope hath given it, for\nHope hath he given it: Hope is the giver, Hope the receiver. This to thee, O\nHope!' Thus he assigns it to a deity.\n\n4:3:4:3333\\. Here they say 1,--Let him not assign it to any deity; for\nwhatsoever deity he here kindles, that deity, being kindled, becomes ever more\nglorious from one day to the morrow; and to whatever fire he here adds fuel,\nthat fire, being kindled, becomes ever more glorious from one day to the\nmorrow; and ever more glorious does he become, whosoever, knowing this,\naccepts (a gift): even as one offers in kindled fire, so does he offer that\n(gift) which he gives to one learned in the scriptures. Therefore he who is\nlearned in the scriptures need not assign (the gift to a deity).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[340:1](sbe2653.htm#fr_805) See II, 2, 2, 3-5.\n\n[341:1](sbe2653.htm#fr_806) 'For he, Soma, doubtless is the visible Pra _g_\napati (pratyaksha _m_ pra _g_ apati _h_ ).'

S. I, 5, 1), where Agni is identified with Rudra, Agni being so called\nbecause he roared (rud). See also _S_ at. Br, I, 7, 3, 8.\n\n[344:1](sbe2653.htm#fr_811) The cows are driven past him along the back of the\naltar, between the hall and Sadas, and then along the north side of the altar,\nsouth of the \xc3\x82gnidhra and between the pit ( _k_ atvala) and heap of rubbish\n(utkara), the sacrificer following them as far as the \xc3\x82gnidhra. At the same\ntime the Subrahma _n_ ya litany (see [III, 3, 4, 17](sbe2614.htm#3:3:4:17)\nseq.) may be recited.\n\n[344:2](sbe2653.htm#fr_812) Saya _n_ a explains 'rupa _n_ i' by 'samarthyani,'\ncapabilities, powers.\n\n[345:1](sbe2653.htm#fr_813) The cows (and other gifts) are presented at the\nsame time. viz. either a hundred to each officiating priest, or to each his\nproportionate share of an aggregate of a hundred cows, viz. twelve cows p. 346\nto each of the first four priests, six to each of the second four (Brahma _n_\na _kh_ a _m_ sin, &c., see \xc2\xa7 22), four to each of the third four, and three\ncows to each of the remaining four priests.\n\n[346:1](sbe2653.htm#fr_814) See [III, 6, 1,\n27](sbe2623.htm#3:6:1:27)-[28](sbe2623.htm#3:6:1:28).\n\n[346:2](sbe2653.htm#fr_815) That is, one of \xc3\x82treya descent, who does not\nofficiate as a priest, and who is seated in front of the Sadas. According to\nthe Ka _n_ va text (and Katy. X, 2, 21) the Adhvaryu approaches him with 'Ka\n\xc3\x82treyam'--who (? sees) the \xc3\x82treya?--thrice repeated. Katyayana specifies some\nsubdivision of the (female line of) the \xc3\x82treya race--also mentioned in the\nsame order in the Pravaradhyaya--as excluded from this privilege. On this\nlegend cf. V, 3, 2, 2; Taitt. S. II, i, 2, 2; Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. VI, 6, 8; Ind.\nStud. III, p. 464.\n\n[346:3](sbe2653.htm#fr_816) Viz. early in the morning of the sutya day, when\nthe Pratar-anuvaka is recited. See [p. 229](sbe2638.htm#page_229), note\n[2](sbe2648.htm#fn_719).\n\n[346:4](sbe2653.htm#fr_817) I take 'pura' in the sense of 'in front' (cf.\n[III, 9, 1, 12](sbe2636.htm#3:9:1:12)), that in the havirdhana shed, and not\nin that of 'formerly' (Ind. Stud. X, 558). The Ka _n_ va text brings out the\nmeaning still more clearly: Sa yad atreyaya hira _n_ ya _m_ dadaty, atrir hi\nva _ri_ shi _n_ a _m_ hota sa yatro p. 347 ha va ada asina _h_ prataranuvakam\nanvaha tad dha smaitat purasino hota _s_ a _m_ saty atha pa _s_ _k_ at tama\n_h_ sado 'bhipupluve.

Saya\n_n_ a also interprets it by 'purvasmin prade _s_ e ahavaniyasya samipe.'\n\n[347:1](sbe2653.htm#fr_818) For the part taken by the Pratihart _ri_ in the\nchanting of stotras, see [p. 310](sbe2649.htm#page_310), note\n[1](sbe2649.htm#fn_747).\n\n[349:1](sbe2653.htm#fr_819) The Ka _n_ va text of this paragraph seems more\ncorrect: Thus he assigns it to deities; for when he bestows (abhyadha)\nanything on a deity, that deity thereby shines ever more brilliantly; and\nwhatever (fuel) he adds to the fire, thereby it shines ever more brilliantly:\nand more glorious does he become from day to day whosoever, knowing it,\naccepts it thus. Here now \xc3\x82suri said, 'But he who is learned in the scriptures\nneed not regard this; for as one puts fuel on kindled fire, and offers on\nkindled fire, thus he gives who gives gifts to one learned in the scriptures.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 5.
