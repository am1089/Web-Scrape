(Scripture) also declares this.\n\nThe Veda also declares the identity of the vidyas; for all Vedanta-texts\nrepresent the object of knowledge as one; cp. e.g. Ka. Up. I, 2, 15, 'That\nword which all the Vedas record;' Ait. \xc3\x82r. Ill, 2,3,12, 'Him only the Bahv\n_ri_ kas consider in the great hymn, the Adhvaryus in the sacrificial fire,\nthe _Kh_ andogas in the Mahavrata ceremony.'--To quote some other instances\nproving the unity of the vidyas: Ka. Up. I, 6, 2, mentions as one of the\nLord's qualities that he\n\np. 191\n\ncauses fear; now this very same quality is referred to in the Taitt. Up. II,\n7, in order to intimate disapprobation of those who are opposed to the\nabsolute unity of that which is, 'For if he makes but the smallest distinction\nin it (the Self), there is fear for him. But that fear is only for him who\nknows (a difference) and does not know (the oneness).'--Similarly the Vai _s_\nvanara, who in the Va _g_ asaneyaka is imaginatively represented as a span\nlong, is referred to in the _Kh_ andogya as something well known, 'But he who\nworships that Vai _s_ vanara Self which is a span long,' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. V,\n18, 1).\n\nAnd as, on the ground of all Vedanta-texts intimating the same matters, hymns\nand the like which are enjoined in one place are employed in other places\n(where they are not expressly enjoined) for the purposes of devout meditation,\nit follows that all Vedanta-texts intimate also (identical) devout\nmeditations.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 5](sbe38148.htm)\n\n"
