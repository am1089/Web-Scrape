He should perform (the ceremonies) wearing the sacrificial cord on his\nleft shoulder and having sipped water.\n\n3\\. During the northern course of the sun, at the time of the increasing moon,\non an auspicious day, before noon: this he should know as the (proper) time\n(for performing the ceremonies).\n\n4\\. And as the prescription (is stated with regard to the time of the single\nceremonies).\n\n5. 5 All (ceremonies) are accompanied by the Anvaharya ( _S_ raddha).\n\np. 14\n\n6. 6 At the end (of each ceremony) he should feed worthy (Brahma _n_ as) according to his ability.\n\n7. 7 A student, after he has studied the Veda, when going to put the last piece of wood (on the fire),\xc2\x97\n\n8\\. Or to seize a wife's hand (i.e. to marry her),\xc2\x97\n\n9. 9 Should fetch water from a hidden place, should sweep a place which is inclined towards north-east, or which is level, and should besmear it (with cow-dung). Beginning from the centre of it he should draw a line from west to east, (another line) from south to north which touches that line at its western end, and three lines from west to east (touching the northwards-turned line at three different points) in its midst (i.e. at neither of its ends). He then should besprinkle (those lines with water).\n\n10\\. In this way the Laksha _n_ a (i.e. the preparation of the place for the\nsacred fire) is performed everywhere.\n\n11\\. With the words 'Bhur, bhuva _h_ , sva _h_ ,' they carry the fire forward\n(to that place) so that they have it in front of them.\n\n12. 12 Or after the householder has died, the chief\n\np. 15\n\n[paragraph continues] (of the family) should do it (i.e. he should set up the\nsacred fire).\n\n13\\. In this way, on the coincidence of an (auspicious) Tithi and an\n(auspicious) Nakshatra, (or of such a Nakshatra) and a Parvan\xc2\x97\n\n14\\. On the full-moon day or on the new-moon day: then he should celebrate the\nsetting up of his (sacred domestic) fire.\n\n15. 15 He should get fire from a Vai _s_ ya's house or from a frying-pan, and should set it up (as his sacred fire);\n\n16\\. Or (he should fetch it) from the house of one who offers many sacrifices,\nbe it a Brahma _n_ a, or a Ra _g_ anya, or a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n17\\. Or he may kindle another fire by attrition and may set it up.\n\n18\\. That is pure, but it does not bring prosperity.\n\n19\\. He may do what he likes (of the things stated as admissible in the last\nSutras.\n\n20. 20 When he puts (at the end of his studentship) the last piece of wood (on the fire), or when he sacrifices when going to seize the hand of a wife, that fire he should keep.\n\n21\\. That becomes his (sacred) domestic fire.\n\n22. 22 Thereby his morning oblation has been offered.\n\np. 16\n\n23. 23 Beginning from that time the sacrificing (of regular morning and evening oblations) in the domestic fire is prescribed, so that he begins with an evening oblation.\n\n24\\. Before the time has come for setting the fire in a blaze, he should fetch\nin the evening and in the morning from a hidden place the water with which the\ndifferent acts (such as sipping water) are performed.\n\n25\\. Or (he should fetch water only) in the evening.\n\n26\\. Or he should draw it out of a water-pot or of a barrel.\n\n27. 27 Before sunset he should set the fire in a blaze, and sacrifice the evening oblation after sunset.\n\n28\\. In the morning he should set the fire in a blaze before sunrise, and\nshould sacrifice the morning oblation before sunrise or after it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[13:1](sbe30004.htm#fr_95) 1, 1-4. Comp. Khadira-G _ri_ hya I, 1, 1. 2. 5. 7.\n\n[13:5](sbe30004.htm#fr_96) I cannot give this translation of the words 'sarva\n_n_ y evanvaharyavanti' without expressing my doubts as to whether the\ncommentator, whom I have followed, is right. He says: 'anu pa _s_ _k_ ad\nahriyate yasmat prak _ri_ ta _m_ karma iti, anu pa _s_ _k_ ad ahriyate yat\nprastutat (prak _ri_ tat?) karma _n_ a iti _k_ anvaharya _m_ nandimukha _s_\nraddha _m_ dakshi _n_ a _k_ o _k_ yate.' It is evident that the first\nexplanation of anvaharya as a ceremony after which the chief sacrifice\nfollows, is inadmissible. Below, IV, 4, 3. 4, Gobhila himself defines the\nAnvaharya _S_ raddha as a monthly ceremony (comp. Manu III, 123; Max Muller,\nIndia, p. 240); it is, consequently, different from a _S_ raddha accompanying\neach G _ri_ hya sacrifice. The _S_ loka which the commentary quotes from a 'g\n_ri_ hyantara' seems to me not to remove the doubt; I think rather that it\ncontains a speculation based on this very passage of Gobhila, taken in the\nsense in p. 14 which the commentator takes it, and on the Sutras IV, 4, 3. 4.\nThus I rather believe that we ought to understand anvaharya as a mess of food\nlike that offered after the dar _s_ apur _n_ amasau sacrifices to the\nofficiating priests (Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, 133), and I propose\nto translate: All (sacrifices) are followed by (the offering of) the Anvaharya\nfood (to the priest).\n\n[14:6](sbe30004.htm#fr_97) Khadira-G _ri_ hya I, 1, 3.\n\n[14:7](sbe30004.htm#fr_98) The text goes on to treat of the setting up of the\ndomestic fire.

I think the paramesh _th_ i is the same person as the _g_ yayan. The\ncommentary gives a different explanation: paramesh _th_ i agnir ity a _k_\nakshate, tasya paramesh _th_ ino\xe0\xa4\xbdgne _h_ kara _n_ a _m_ yathoktena vidhina\nsvikara _n_ am.\n\n[15:15](sbe30004.htm#fr_101) 15-18.
