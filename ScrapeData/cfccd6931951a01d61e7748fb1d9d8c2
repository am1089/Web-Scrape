When he (the Adhvaryu) is about to make the second libation with\nthe offering-spoon (sru _k_ ), he (twice) lays his joined hands (a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_\nali) on the ground before the two offering-spoons ( _g_ uhu and upabh _ri_ t),\nwith the formulas (Va _g_. S. II, 7 b), 'Adoration to the gods!' 'Svadha to\nthe fathers!' Thereby he propitiates the gods and the fathers, now that\n\np. 128\n\nhe is about to perform the duties of the sacrificial priest. With the formula,\n'May ye two be easy to manage for me!' he takes the two offering-spoons: he\nthereby means to say, 'May ye two be easy to handle for me; may I be able to\nhandle you!'--He further says (Va _g_. S. II. 8), 'May I this day offer up the\nbutter to the gods unspilt!' whereby he means to say, 'May I to-day perform an\nundisturbed sacrifice to the gods!'\n\n1:4:5:22\\. And again, 'May I not sin against thee with my foot, O Vish _n_ u!'\nVish _n_ u, indeed, is the sacrifice: it is the latter therefore that he\npropitiates by saying, 'may I not sin against thee!' Further, 'May I step into\nthy wealth-abounding shade, O Agni!' whereby he says, 'may I step into thy\nauspicious shade, O Agni 1!'\n\n1:4:5:33\\. Further, 'Thou art the abode of Vish _n_ u!' Vish _n_ u, indeed, is\nthe sacrifice, and near to this he now stands: this is why he says, 'thou art\nthe abode of Vish _n_ u!'--'Here Indra performed his heroic deed 2;' for it\nwas while standing in this place that Indra drove off towards the south the\nevil spirits, the Rakshas: for this reason he says, 'here Indra performed his\nheroic deed.'--'Erect stood the cult;' cult,\n\np. 129\n\nnamely, means sacrifice, hence he thereby says 'erect stood the sacrifice.'\n\n1:4:5:44\\. Further (Va _g_. S. II, 9): 'O Agni, take thou upon thyself the\noffice of Hot _ri_ , take thou upon thyself the part of messenger!' for Agni\nis both Hot _ri_ and messenger to the gods: hence he thereby says, 'know thou\n1 both (offices) which thou art (holding) for the gods!'--'May earth and\nheaven guard thee! Guard thou earth and heaven!' there is nothing obscure in\nthis.--'Indra, by this butter-oblation, may be the maker of good offering\n(svish _t_ ak _ri_ t) for the gods! Svaha!' Indra, indeed, is the deity of\nsacrifice; therefore he says 'Indra, by this butter-oblation . . . 'It is for\nspeech that he makes this sprinkling, and Indra is speech' so say some; and\nfor this reason also he says Indra, by this butter-oblation. . .'\n\n1:4:5:55\\. Having then returned (to his former position behind the altar),\nwithout letting the two offering-spoons touch each other, he mixes (some of\nthe butter left in the _g_ uhu) with (that in) the dhruva. Now the second\nlibation (which he has just offered) is the head of the sacrifice, and the\ndhruva is its body 2: hence he thereby replaces the head on the body. And the\nsecond libation, moreover, is the head of the sacrifice, and the head ( _s_\niras) represents excellence ( _s_ ri), for the head does indeed represent\nexcellence: hence, of one who is the most excellent ( _s_ resh _th_ a) of a\ncommunity, people say that he is 'the head of that community.'\n\np. 130\n\n1:4:5:66\\. The sacrificer, assuredly, stands behind the dhruva, and he who\nmeans evil to him stands behind the upabh _ri_ t 1. Hence if he were to mix\n(the butter remaining in the _g_ uhu) with (that in) the upabh _ri_ t, he\nwould bestow excellence on him who means evil to the sacrificer; but in this,\nway he bestows that excellence on the sacrificer himself: for this reason he\nmixes (the butter in the gull with (that in) the dhruva.\n\n1:4:5:77\\. He mixes it, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 9 h), 'Light with\nlight!' for light (lustre), indeed, is the butter in the one (spoon) and light\nalso is that in the other. Thereby these two lights unite with each other, and\nfor this reason he mixes (the butter) in this manner.\n\n1:4:5:88\\. Now a dispute once took place between Mind and Speech as to 2 which\nwas the better of the two. Both Mind and Speech said, 'I am excellent!'\n\n1:4:5:99\\. Mind said, 'Surely I am better than thou, for thou dost not speak\nanything that is not understood by me; and since thou art only an imitator of\nwhat is done by me and a follower in my wake, I am surely better than thou!'\n\n1:4:5:1010\\. Speech said, 'Surely I am better than thou, for what thou knowest\nI make known, I communicate.'\n\np. 131\n\n1:4:5:1111\\. They went to appeal to Pra _g_ apati for his decision. He, Pra\n_g_ apati, decided in favour of Mind, saying (to Speech), 'Mind is indeed\nbetter than thou, for thou art an imitator of its deeds and a follower in its\nwake; and inferior, surely, is he who imitates his better's deeds and follows\nin his wake.'\n\n1:4:5:1212\\. Then Speech (va _k_ , fem.) being thus gainsaid, was dismayed and\nmiscarried. She, Speech, then said to Pra _g_ apati, 'May I never be thy\noblation-bearer, I whom thou hast gainsaid!' Hence whatever at the sacrifice\nis performed for Pra _g_ apati, that is performed in a low voice; for speech\nwould not act as oblation-bearer for Pra _g_ apati.\n\n1:4:5:1313\\. That germ (retas) the gods then brought away in a skin or in some\n(vessel). They asked: 'Is it here (atra)?' and therefore it developed into\nAtri. For the same reason one becomes guilty by (intercourse) with a woman who\nhas just miscarried (atreyi); for it is from that woman, from the goddess\nSpeech, that these (germs) originate 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[127:1](sbe1220.htm#fr_323) The sweeping of the fire is performed with the\nstraw-band with which the fire-wood was tied together (Katy. III, 1, 13), and\nwhich is here compared with the lash of a whip.\n\n[128:1](sbe1221.htm#fr_324) While he pronounces this formula (and while the\nHot _ri_ recites the formula of invitation to the gods, cf. note on I, 4, 2,\n26) the Adhvaryu steps to the south side of the altar (and \xc3\x82havaniya fire) and\nin so doing must take care always to keep the left foot before the right\n(Katy. III. 1, 16, 18) and not to touch the top of the prastara, ib. 17,\nschol. In returning (par. 5) to his former position he has to keep the right\nfoot before the left.\n\n[128:2](sbe1221.htm#fr_325) With this and the succeeding formulas, the\nAdhvaryu makes the second libation (cf. note on I, 4, 4, 1). Before the butter\nis poured into the fire the sacrificer pronounces the dedicatory formula, 'Om!\nfor Indra this, not for me!'\n\n[129:1](sbe1221.htm#fr_326) Ve _h_ , in the formula, our author refers to vid,\n'to know,' instead of to vi, 'to strive after, undertake.'\n\n[129:2](sbe1221.htm#fr_327) Cf. I, 3, 2, 2, and Taitt. S. II, 5, 11, 7-8. The\nsecond libation (aghara) has just been made with the _g_ uhu.\n\n[130:1](sbe1221.htm#fr_328) The same idea has been expressed above, I, 3, 2,\n11.\n\n[130:2](sbe1221.htm#fr_329) Cf. Taitt. S. II, 5, 11, 4: 'Mind and Speech (or\nVoice) were contending against one another.' 'I will carry the oblation to the\ngods!' said Speech. 'I (will carry it) to the gods!' said the Mind. They went\nto Pra _g_ apati to question him. Pra _g_ apati said (to Speech), 'Thou art\nthe handmaid (duti) of the mind, for what one thinks in one's mind that one\nspeaks with one's speech.' [Speech replied], 'Then indeed they shall not offer\nto thee with speech!' For this reason they offer to Pra _g_ apati with the\nmind; for Pra _g_ apati, as it were, is the mind, &c.\n\n[131:1](sbe1221.htm#fr_330) 'Tasmad apy atreyya yoshitainasvy etasyai hi\nyoshayai va _k_ o devataya ete sambhuta _h_ ,' [ete laukika _h_ sarve garbha\n_h_ sambhuta _h_ , Say.]--The Ka _n_ va text has, 'Tasmad api\nstriyatreyyainasvity ahur etasya hi sa yoshaya devataya va _k_ a _h_ sambhuta\niti' ['--for it is from that woman, from the goddess Speech, that he (Atri)\noriginated'].\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 5, 1.
