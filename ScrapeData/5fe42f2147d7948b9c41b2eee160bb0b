Then, early next morning 2, when about to bespeak the morning\nprayer 3, he yokes the Fire-altar, thinking, 'With it, when yoked, I shall\nobtain;' and by it, when yoked, he obtains all wishes. He\n\np. 250\n\nyokes it prior to the whole performance, so that all that is done thereafter\nis laden on that yoked (altar-cart).\n\n9:4:4:22\\. He yokes it on the enclosing-sticks, for those enclosing-sticks are\nfires 1: it is with fires he thus yokes the fire-altar.\n\n9:4:4:33\\. Having touched the middle enclosing-stick 2, he mutters this\nformula (Va _g_. S. XVIII, 51), 'The Fire I yoke with might, with ghee!'--\nmight means strength: thus, 'The fire I yoke (furnish) with strength, with\nghee;'--'the heavenly bird, great in vigour,'--for that (fire-altar) is indeed\na heavenly bird, and great in vigour, in smoke 3;--'Thereby we will go to the\nregion of the bay, rising unto the light, beyond the highest firmament!'--The\nfirmament, doubtless, is the heavenly world: thus, 'Thereby we will go to the\nregion, of the bay (horse, the sun) mounting up to the heavenly world, beyond\nthe highest firmament.'\n\n9:4:4:44\\. Then on the southern (right) one, with (Va _g_. S. XVIII, 52), 'By\nthese never-decaying, feathered wings of thine wherewith thou repellest the\ndemons, O Agni, may we fly to the world of the righteous whither the erst-born\nseers went of old!' he thereby alludes to those _Ri_ shis 4.\n\np. 251\n\n9:4:4:55\\. Then on the northern (left) one, with (Va _g_. S. XVIII, 53), 'The\npotent drop, the faithful eagle, the golden-winged bird, the active (bhura _n_\nyu),'--golden means immortal: thus, 'the immortal-winged bird, the bearer\n(bhart _ri_ );'--'the mighty is seated in the firm seat: homage be to thee,\ninjure me not!'--he thereby gives utterance to a surrender of his own self.\n\n9:4:4:66\\. Now that middle formula is the body, and the two on both sides\nthereof are the wings (of the bird-shaped altar): hence these two allude to\n'wings 1,' for these two are the wings.\n\n9:4:4:77\\. With three (formulas) he yokes it,--threefold is Agni: as great as\nAgni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus yokes him.\n\n9:4:4:88\\. And when he has pressed the king (Soma) he offers in the fire 2.\nThis, indeed, is that very rite of consecration (or pressing)--and by that he\nis now consecrated (or pressed)--which this (Sacrificer) is permitted to\nperform by those deities with whose permission he is consecrated 3; for he\nalone becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity,\nand not he whom (they do) not (allow to assume it). Now when he offers in the\nfire he thereby consecrates (anoints) Agni, and that divine body of his, being\nconsecrated by Soma, becomes consecrated by the nectar of immortality. And he\nhimself drinks (thereof): he thereby consecrates\n\np. 252\n\nhimself, and this self (body) of his, being consecrated by Soma, becomes\nconsecrated by the nectar of immortality.\n\n9:4:4:99\\. Having offered in the fire (or, on the fire-altar), he drinks\n(Soma), for that (fire-altar) is his (the Sacrificer's) divine body 1, and\nthis (Sacrificer's real body) is his human one; and the gods indeed were\nfirst, and afterwards men: therefore, having offered (Soma) in the fire, he\ndrinks (thereof).\n\n9:4:4:1010\\. Having now obtained the wish for (the accomplishment of) which he\nyokes it (the altar), he unyokes it when about to bespeak the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya stotra 2,--for the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya is the heavenly\nworld, and it is for the attainment of that (world) that he yokes it: thus (he\nunyokes it) after obtaining the wish for which he yoked it.\n\n9:4:4:1111\\. It is prior to the Stotra that he unyokes it:--were he to unyoke\nafter the Stotra, he would pass beyond that world 3 and lose it; but when he\nunyokes prior to the Stotra, he unyokes forthwith after reaching the world of\nheaven.\n\n9:4:4:1212\\. He unyokes it on the enclosing-sticks, for it\n\np. 253\n\nis on the enclosing-sticks that he yokes it, and at whatever place (of the\nbody) people yoke a horse there they also unyoke it.\n\n9:4:4:1313\\. Having touched it (the fire) at the two joints 1, he mutters\nthese two formulas,--thus two formulas equal in power three enclosing-sticks,\n--with (Va _g_. S. XVIII, 54), 'The sky's head thou art, the earth's navel,\n[the essence of the waters and plants, the life of all, the ample refuge (?):\nhomage be to the path!]' on the right, and with (55), 'On the head of the All\ndost thou keep standing, [in the (aerial) ocean is thy heart, in the waters\nthy life: bestow water, send the water-store (cloud),--from the sky, from the\ncloud, from the air, from the earth, favour us with rain!]' on the left\n(joint),--thus with two (verses) containing (the word) 'head,' for this, is\nindeed its head; and containing (the words) 'in the waters 2': that Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\naya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya doubtless is Agni Vai _s_ vanara's chant of praise, and water\nis (a means of) appeasing,--therefore (he touches them) with two (verses)\ncontaining (the words)--'the waters.'\n\n9:4:4:1414\\. With two (verses) he unyokes it,--two-footed is the Sacrificer,\nand Agni is the Sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,\nwith so much he thus unyokes him. With three (verses) he yokes,--that (makes)\nfive,--the fire-altar consists of five layers, the year (of) five seasons, and\nAgni is\n\np. 254\n\nthe year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great is this.\n\n9:4:4:1515\\. Now, some yoke it (the fire-altar) at a Praya _n_ iya 1 Atiratra,\nand unyoke it at an Udayaniya, saying, 'The unyoking, surely, is a certain\nform of completion, and why should we perform a form of completion prior to\nthe completion (of the sacrifice)?' But let him not do this, for day by day\nthis sacrifice is performed, and day by day it comes to completion; day by day\nhe yokes that (altar) for the attainment of the heavenly world, and day by day\nhe thereby attains the heavenly world: let him therefore yoke it day by day,\nand unyoke it day by day.\n\n9:4:4:1616\\. And, indeed, it would be just as if, at the Praya _n_ iya\nAtiratra, after reciting the kindling-verses, he were to say, 'Hereafter 2, at\nthe Udayaniya, I shall recite (them again)!' Let him therefore yoke (the\naltar) day by day, and unyoke it day by day.\n\n9:4:4:1717\\. And on this point, _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya, indeed, having enjoined on\nthe Ka\xe1\xb9\x85katiyas the day-by-day performance,\n\np. 255\n\nwent on his way, saying, 'Day by day they shall yoke for you, and day by day\nthey shall unyoke!' Let him therefore yoke day by day, and unyoke day by day.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[249:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_438) For the complete formulas, see V, 3, 3, 11, 12.\n\n[249:2](sbe4342.htm#fr_439) That is, on the first Sutya, or pressing-day.\n\n[249:3](sbe4342.htm#fr_440) That is, by calling on the Hot _ri_ to 'Recite to\nthe gods, the early coming!' see III, 9, 3, 10, with note thereto giving\nparticulars regarding the Prataranuvaka.\n\n[250:1](sbe4342.htm#fr_441) See the ritual legend, I, 3, 3, 13 seq.\n\n[250:2](sbe4342.htm#fr_442) That is, the one along the hind (or west) side of\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya fire on the great altar, being the base of the triangle formed\nby the three enclosing-sticks. The order in which they are touched is the same\nas that in which they were laid down.\n\n[250:3](sbe4342.htm#fr_443) Mahidhara actually takes 'smoke (dhuma)' here to\nbe intended as the literal meaning of 'vayas.'\n\n[250:4](sbe4342.htm#fr_444) Viz. the seven _Ri_ shis, identified with the\nseven vital airs which came to constitute the first Purusha (Agni-Pra _g_\napati), and hence the bird-shaped fire-altar. See VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.\n\n[251:1](sbe4342.htm#fr_445) In the first formula the word for 'bird (eagle)'\nis 'supar _n_ a,' literally 'the well-winged (well-feathered) one.'\n\n[251:2](sbe4342.htm#fr_446) This refers to the libations made from the several\ncups (grahas), the contents of which are afterwards consumed by the priests\n(and Sacrificer); cf. part ii, p. 316, note 1.\n\n[251:3](sbe4342.htm#fr_447) For the same irregular construction, see [IX, 4,\n1, 13](sbe4339.htm#9:4:1:13).\n\n[252:1](sbe4342.htm#fr_448) See [IX, 3, 4, 12](sbe4338.htm#9:3:4:12).\n\n[252:2](sbe4342.htm#fr_449) The Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya (or Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya) stotra is the last and characteristic chant of the Agnish _t_ oma\nmode of Soma-sacrifice, whence it is more properly called Agnish _t_ oma-\nsaman; the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya, properly speaking, being the verses,\nSama-v. II, 53, 54, chanted to a particular tune, and generally (though not\nalways) used for the closing chant of the Agnish _t_ oma.\n\n[252:3](sbe4342.htm#fr_450) That is, because the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya\nmarks, as it were, the end of the (Agnish _t_ oma) Soma-sacrifice, and\nanything performed thereafter is, so to speak, outside the sacrifice, or\nbeyond it. Katy. _S_ r. XVIII, 6, 17 calls it \xc3\x82gnimaruta stotra, i.e. the\nchant belonging to the \xc3\x82gnimaruta- _s_ astra (which has to be recited by the\nHot _ri_ after that chant); cf. part ii, p. 369 note.\n\n[253:1](sbe4342.htm#fr_451) That is, at the two points where the right\n(southern) and left (northern) enclosing-sticks (forming the two sides of the\ntriangle, the apex of which lies east of the centre of the fire) meet the\nwestern enclosing-stick (as the base of the triangle).\n\n[253:2](sbe4342.htm#fr_452) The first verse, in point of fact, contains the\ngenitive case 'of the waters.'\n\n[254:1](sbe4342.htm#fr_453) For the Praya _n_ iya ish _t_ i (to five deities)\nof the ordinary Agnish _t_ oma, see part ii, pp. 47, 48, note. In the present\ncase a special Soma-sacrifice of the Atiratra type would seem to take its\nplace, just as the Pavitra, an Agnish _t_ oma Soma-sacrifice, at the Ra _g_\nasuya, took the place of the ordinary Anvarambha _n_ iya ish _t_ i (or opening\noffering); see part iii, p. 42. In the same way there would apparently be a\nspecial Udayaniya Soma-sacrifice; whilst our author would have the ceremonies\nof yoking and unyoking of the fire-altar performed on the very day (or days)\nof the Soma-sacrifice, that is to say, he would have the ordinary Praya _n_\niyesh _t_ i and Udayaniyesh _t_ i performed as parts of the principal Soma-day\n(or days, if there are to be more than one).\n\n[254:2](sbe4342.htm#fr_454) Or, therefore, as Saya _n_ a takes it. If the\nUdayaniya were a special Soma-sacrifice, the Samidhenis (part i, p. 102 seq.;\nii, p. 13, note 3) would have to be recited anew.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 5, 1. Fifth Adhyaya.
