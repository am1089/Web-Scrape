Because Scripture is the source (of the knowledge of Brahman).\n\nBecause Brahman, being raised above all contact with the senses, is not an\nobject of perception and the other means of proof, but to be known through\nScripture only; therefore the text 'Whence these creatures are born,' &c., has\nto be accepted as instructing us regarding the true nature of Brahman.--But,\nour opponent points out, Scripture cannot be the source of our knowledge of\nBrahman, because Brahman is to be known through other means. For it is an\nacknowledged principle that Scripture has meaning only with regard to what is\nnot established by other sources of knowledge.--But what, to raise a prima\nfacie counter objection, are those other sources of knowledge?\n\np. 162\n\n[paragraph continues] It cannot, in the first place, be Perception. Perception\nis twofold, being based either on the sense-organs or on extraordinary\nconcentration of mind (yoga). Of Perception of the former kind there are again\ntwo sub-species, according as Perception takes place either through the outer\nsense-organs or the internal organ (manas). Now the outer sense-organs produce\nknowledge of their respective objects, in so far as the latter are in actual\ncontact with the organs, but are quite unable to give rise to the knowledge of\nthe special object constituted by a supreme Self that is capable of being\nconscious of and creating the whole aggregate of things. Nor can internal\nperception give rise to such knowledge; for only purely internal things, such\nas pleasure and pain, fall within its cognisance, and it is incapable of\nrelating itself to external objects apart from the outer sense-organs. Nor,\nagain, perception based on Yoga; for although such perception--which springs\nfrom intense imagination--implies a vivid presentation of things, it is, after\nall, nothing more than a reproduction of objects perceived previously, and\ndoes not therefore rank as an instrument of knowledge; for it has no means of\napplying itself to objects other than those perceived previously. And if,\nafter all, it does so, it is (not a means of knowledge but) a source of error.\n--Nor also inference either of the kind which proceeds on the observation of\nspecial cases or of the kind which rests on generalizations (cp. Nyaya Su. I,\n1,5,). Not inference of the former kind, because such inference is not known\nto relate to anything lying beyond the reach of the senses. Nor inference of\nthe latter kind, because we do not observe any characteristic feature that is\ninvariably accompanied by the presence of a supreme Self capable of being\nconscious of, and constructing, the universe of things.--But there _is_ such a\nfeature, viz. the world's being an effected thing; it being a matter of common\nexperience that whatever is an effect or product, is due to an agent who\npossesses a knowledge of the material cause, the instrumental cause, the final\nend, and the person meant to make use of the thing produced. It further is\nmatter of experience\n\np. 163\n\nthat whatever consists of non-sentient matter is dependent on, or ruled by, a\nsingle intelligent principle. The former generalization is exemplified by the\ncase of jars and similar things, and the latter by a living body in good\nhealth, which consists of non-intelligent matter dependent on an intelligent\nprinciple. And that the body is an effected thing follows from its consisting\nof parts.--Against this argumentation also objections may be raised. What, it\nmust be asked, do you understand by this dependence on an intelligent\nprinciple? Not, we suppose, that the origination and subsistence of the non-\nintelligent thing should be dependent on the intelligent principle; for in\nthat case your example would not help to prove your contention. Neither the\norigin nor the subsistence of a person's healthy body depends on the\nintelligent soul of that person alone; they rather are brought about by the\nmerit and demerit of all those souls which in any way share the fruition of\nthat body--the wife, e.g. of that person, and others. Moreover, the existence\nof a body made up of parts means that body's being connected with its parts in\nthe way of so-called intimate relation (sama-vaya), and this requires a\ncertain combination of the parts but not a presiding intelligent principle.\nThe existence of animated bodies, moreover, has for its characteristic mark\nthe process of breathing, which is absent in the case of the earth, sea,\nmountains, &c.--all of which are included in the class of things concerning\nwhich you wish to prove something--, and we therefore miss a uniform kind of\nexistence common to all those things.--Let us then understand by the\ndependence of a non-intelligent thing on an intelligent principle, the fact of\nthe motion of the former depending on the latter!--This definition, we rejoin,\nwould comprehend also those cases in which heavy things, such as carriages,\nmasses of stone, trees, &c., are set in motion by several intelligent beings\n(while what you want to prove is the dependence of a moving thing on one\nintelligent principle). If, on the other hand, you mean to say that all motion\ndepends on intelligence in general, you only prove what requires no proof.--\nAnother alternative, moreover,\n\np. 164\n\nhere presents itself. As we both admit the existence of individual souls, it\nwill be the more economical hypothesis to ascribe to them the agency implied\nin the construction of the world. Nor must you object to this view on the\nground that such agency cannot belong to the individual souls because they do\nnot possess the knowledge of material causes, &c., as specified above; for all\nintelligent beings are capable of direct knowledge of material causes, such as\nearth and so on, and instrumental causes, such as sacrifices and the like.\nEarth and other material substances, as well as sacrifices and the like, are\ndirectly perceived by individual intelligent beings at the present time (and\nwere no doubt equally perceived so at a former time when this world had to be\nplanned and constructed). Nor does the fact that intelligent beings are not\ncapable of direct insight into the unseen principle--called 'apurva,' or by\nsimilar names--which resides in the form of a power in sacrifices and other\ninstrumental causes, in any way preclude their being agents in the\nconstruction of the world. Direct insight into powers is nowhere required for\nundertaking work: what _is_ required for that purpose is only direct\npresentative knowledge of the things endowed with power, while of power itself\nit suffices to have some kind of knowledge. Potters apply themselves to the\ntask of making pots and jars on the strength of the direct knowledge they\npossess of the implements of their work--the wheel, the staff, &c.--without\ntroubling about a similar knowledge of the powers inherent in those\nimplements; and in the same way intelligent beings may apply themselves to\ntheir work (to be effected by means of sacrifices, &c.), if only they are\nassured by sacred tradition of the existence of the various powers possessed\nby sacrifices and the like.--Moreover, experience teaches that agents having a\nknowledge of the material and other causes must be inferred only in the case\nof those effects which can be produced, and the material and other causes of\nwhich can be known: such things, on the other hand, as the earth, mountains,\nand oceans, can neither be produced, nor can their material and other causes\never be known; we therefore\n\np. 165\n\nhave no right to infer for them intelligent producers. Hence the quality of\nbeing an effected thing can be used ns an argument for proving the existence\nof an intelligent causal agent, only where that quality is found in things,\nthe production of which, and the knowledge of the causes of which, is possible\nat all.--Experience further teaches that earthen pots and similar things are\nproduced by intelligent agents possessing material bodies, using implements,\nnot endowed with the power of a Supreme Lord, limited in knowledge and so on;\nthe quality of being an effect therefore supplies a reason for inferring an\nintelligent agent of the kind described only, and thus is opposed to the\ninference of attributes of a contrary nature, viz. omniscience, omnipotence,\nand those other attributes that belong--to the highest Soul, whose existence\nyou wish to establish.--Nor does this (as might be objected) imply an\nabandonment of all inference. Where the thing to be inferred is known through\nother means of proof also, any qualities of an opposite nature which maybe\nsuggested by the inferential mark (linga) are opposed by those other means of\nproof, and therefore must be dropped. In the case under discussion, however,\nthe thine; to be inferred is something not guaranteed by any other means of\nproof, viz. a person capable of constructing the entire universe; here there\nis nothing to interfere with the ascription to such a person of all those\nqualities which, on the basis of methodical inference, necessarily belong to\nit.--The conclusion from all this is that, apart from Scripture, the existence\nof a Lord does not admit of proof.\n\nAgainst all this the Purvapakshin now restates his case as follows:--It cannot\nbe gainsaid that the world is something effected, for it is made up of parts.\nWe may state this argument in various technical forms. 'The earth, mountains,\n&c., are things effected, because they consist of parts; in the same way as\njars and similar things.' 'The earth, seas, mountains, &c., are effects,\nbecause, while being big; (i.e. non-atomic), they are capable of motion; just\nas jars and the like.' 'Bodies, the world, &c., are effects, because, while\nbeing big, they are solid (murtta); just as jars and the like.'--But, an\nobjection is raised, in the case\n\np. 166\n\nof things made up of parts we do not, in addition to this attribute of\nconsisting of parts, observe any other aspect determining that the thing is an\neffect--so as to enable us to say 'this thing is effected, and that thing is\nnot'; and, on the other hand, we do observe it as an indispensable condition\nof something being an effect, that there should be the possibility of such an\neffect being brought about, and of the existence of such knowledge of material\ncauses, &c. (as the bringing about of the effect presupposes).--Not so, we\nreply. In the case of a cause being inferred on the ground of an effect, the\nknowledge and power of the cause must be inferred in accordance with the\nnature of the effect. From the circumstance of a thing consisting of parts we\nknow it to be an effect and on this basis we judge of the power and knowledge\nof the cause. A person recognises pots, jars and the like, as things produced,\nand therefrom infers the constructive skill and knowledge of their maker;\nwhen, after this, he sees for the first time a kingly palace with all its\nvarious wonderful parts and structures, he concludes from the special way in\nwhich the parts are joined that this also is an effected thing, and then makes\nan inference as to the architect's manifold knowledge and skill. Analogously,\nwhen a living body and the world have once been recognised to be effects, we\ninfer--as their maker--some special intelligent being, possessing direct\ninsight into their nature and skill to construct them.--Pleasure and pain,\nmoreover, by which men are requited for their merit and demerit, are\nthemselves of a non-intelligent nature, and hence cannot bring about their\nresults unless they are controlled by an intelligent principle, and this also\ncompels us to assume a being capable of allotting to each individual soul a\nfate corresponding to its deserts. For we do not observe that non-intelligent\nimplements, such as axes and the like, however much they may be favoured by\ncircumstances of time, place, and so on, are capable of producing posts and\npillars unless they be handled by a carpenter. And to quote against the\ngeneralization on which we rely the instance of the seed and sprout and the\nlike can only spring from an ignorance and stupidity which\n\np. 167\n\nmay be called truly demoniac. The same remark would apply to pleasure and pain\nif used as a counter instance. (For in all these cases the action which\nproduces an effect must necessarily be guided by an intelligent\nprinciple.)--Nor may we assume, as a 'less complicated hypothesis,' that the\nguiding principle in the construction of the world is the individual souls,\nwhose existence is acknowledged by both parties. For on the testimony of\nobservation we must deny to those souls the power of seeing what is extremely\nsubtle or remote in time or place (while such power must necessarily be\nascribed to a world-constructing intelligence). On the other hand, we have no\nground for concluding that the Lord is, like the individual souls, destitute\nof such power; hence it cannot be said that other means of knowledge make it\nimpossible to infer such a Lord. The fact rather is that as his existence is\nproved by the argument that any definite effect presupposes a causal agent\ncompetent to produce that effect, he is proved at the same time as possessing\nthe essential power of intuitively knowing and ruling all things in the\nuniverse.--The contention that from the world being an effect it follows that\nits maker does not possess lordly power and so on, so that the proving reason\nwould prove something contrary to the special attributes (belonging to a\nsupreme agent, viz. omnipotence, omniscience, &c.), is founded on evident\nignorance of the nature of the inferential process. For the inference clearly\ndoes not prove that there exist in the thing inferred all the attributes\nbelonging to the proving collateral instances, including even those attributes\nwhich stand in no causal relation to the effect. A certain effect which is\nproduced by some agent presupposes just so much power and knowledge on the\npart of that agent as is requisite for the production of the effect, but in no\nway presupposes any incapability or ignorance on the part of that agent with\nregard to things other than the particular effect; for such incapability and\nignorance do not stand towards that effect in any causal relation. If the\norigination of the effect can be accounted for on the basis of the agent's\ncapability of bringing it about, and of his knowledge\n\np. 168\n\nof the special material and instrumental causes, it would be unreasonable to\nascribe causal agency to his (altogether irrelevant) incapabilities and\nignorance with regard to other things, only because those incapabilities, &c.,\nare observed to exist together with his special capability and knowledge. The\nquestion would arise moreover whether such want of capability and knowledge\n(with regard to things other than the one actually effected) would be helpful\ntowards the bringing about of that one effect, in so far as extending to all\nother things or to some other things. The former alternative is excluded\nbecause no agent, a potter e.g., is quite ignorant of all other things but his\nown special work; and the second alternative is inadmissible because there is\nno definite rule indicating that there should be certain definite kinds of\nwant of knowledge and skill in the case of all agents 1, and hence exceptions\nwould arise with regard to every special case of want of knowledge and skill.\nFrom this it follows that the absence of lordly power and similar qualities\nwhich (indeed is observed in the case of ordinary agents but) in no way\ncontributes towards the production of the effects (to which such agents give\nrise) is not proved in the case of that which we wish to prove (i.e. a Lord,\ncreator of the world), and that hence Inference does not establish qualities\ncontrary (to the qualities characteristic of a Lord).\n\nA further objection will perhaps be raised, viz. that as experience teaches\nthat potters and so on direct their implements through the mediation of their\nown bodies, we are not justified in holding that a bodiless Supreme Lord\ndirects the material and instrumental causes of the universe.--But in reply to\nthis we appeal to the fact of experience, that evil demons possessing men's\nbodies, and also venom, are driven or drawn out of those bodies by mere will\npower. Nor must you ask in what way the volition of a bodiless\n\np. 169\n\n[paragraph continues] Lord can put other bodies in motion; for volition is not\ndependent on a body. The cause of volitions is not the body but the internal\norgan (manas), and such an organ we ascribe to the Lord also, since what\nproves the presence of an internal organ endowed with power and knowledge is\njust the presence of effects.--But volitions, even if directly springing from\nthe internal organ, can belong to embodied beings only, such only possessing\ninternal organs!--This objection also is founded on a mistaken generalization:\nthe fact rather is that the internal organ is permanent, and exists also in\nseparation from the body. The conclusion, therefore, is that--as the\nindividual souls with their limited capacities and knowledge, and their\ndependence on merit and demerit, are incapable of givin rise to things so\nvariously and wonderfully made as worlds and animated bodies are--inference\ndirectly leads us to the theory that there is a supreme intelligent agent,\ncalled the Lord, who possesses unfathomable, unlimited powers and wisdom, is\ncapable of constructing the entire world, is without a body, and through his\nmere volition brings about the infinite expanse of this entire universe so\nvariously and wonderfully planned. As Brahman may thus be ascertained by means\nof knowledge other than revelation, the text quoted under the preceding Sutra\ncannot be taken to convey instruction as to Brahman. Since, moreover,\nexperience demonstrates that material and instrumental causes always are\nthings absolutely distinct from each other, as e.g. the clay and the potter\nwith his implements; and since, further, there are substances not made up of\nparts, as e.g. ether, which therefore cannot be viewed as effects; we must\nobject on these grounds also to any attempt to represent the one Brahman as\nthe universal material and instrumental cause of the entire world.\n\nAgainst all this we now argue as follows:--The Vedanta-text declaring the\norigination, &c., of the world does teach that there is a Brahman possessing\nthe characteristics mentioned; since Scripture alone is a means for the\nknowledge of Brahman. That the world is an effected thing because it consists\nof parts; and that, as all effects are observed to\n\np. 170\n\nhave for their antecedents certain appropriate agents competent to produce\nthem, we must infer a causal agent competent to plan and construct the\nuniverse, and standing towards it in the relation of material and operative\ncause--this would be a conclusion altogether unjustified. There is no proof to\nshow that the earth, oceans, &c., although things produced, were created at\none time by one creator. Nor can it be pleaded in favour of such a conclusion\nthat all those things have one uniform character of being effects, and thus\nare analogous to one single jar; for we observe that various effects are\ndistinguished by difference of time of production, and difference of\nproducers. Nor again may you maintain the oneness of the creator on the ground\nthat individual souls are incapable of the creation of this wonderful\nuniverse, and that if an additional principle be assumed to account for the\nworld--which manifestly is a product--it would be illegitimate to assume more\nthan one such principle. For we observe that individual beings acquire more\nand more extraordinary powers in consequence of an increase of religious\nmerit; and as we may assume that through an eventual supreme degree of merit\nthey may in the end qualify themselves for producing quite extraordinary\neffects, we have no right to assume a highest soul of infinite merit,\ndifferent from all individual souls. Nor also can it be proved that all things\nare destroyed and produced all at once; for no such thing is observed to take\nplace, while it is, on the other hand, observed that things are produced and\ndestroyed in succession; and if we infer that all things are produced and\ndestroyed because they are effects, there is no reason why this production and\ndestruction should not take place in a way agreeing with ordinary experience.\nIf, therefore, what it is desired to prove is the agency of one intelligent\nbeing, we are met by the difficulty that the proving reason (viz. the\ncircumstance of something being an effect) is not invariably connected with\nwhat it is desired to prove; there, further, is the fault of qualities not met\nwith in experience being attributed to the subject about which something has\nto be proved; and lastly there is the fault\n\np. 171\n\nof the proving collateral instances being destitute of what has to be proved--\nfor experience does not exhibit to us one agent capable of producing\neverything. If, on the other hand, what you wish to prove is merely the\nexistence of an intelligent creative agent, you prove only what is proved\nalready (not contested by any one).--Moreover, if you use the attribute of\nbeing an effect (which belongs to the totality of things) as a means to prove\nthe existence of one omniscient and omnipotent creator, do you view this\nattribute as belonging to all things in so far as produced together, or in so\nfar as produced in succession? In the former case the attribute of being an\neffect is not established (for experience does not show that all things are\nproduced together); and in the latter case the attribute would really prove\nwhat is contrary to the hypothesis of one creator (for experience shows that\nthings produced in succession have different causes). In attempting to prove\nthe agency of one intelligent creative being only, we thus enter into conflict\nwith Perception and Inference, and we moreover contradict Scripture, which\nsays that 'the potter is born' and 'the cartwright is born' (and thus declares\na plurality of intelligent agents). Moreover, as we observe that all effected\nthings, such as living bodies and so on, are connected with pleasure and the\nlike, which are the effects of sattva (goodness) and the other primary\nconstituents of matter, we must conclude that effected things have sattva and\nso on for their causes. Sattva and so on--which constitute the distinctive\nelements of the causal substance--are the causes of the various nature of the\neffects. Now those effects can be connected with their causes only in so far\nas the internal organ of a person possessing sattva and so on undergoes\nmodifications. And that a person possesses those qualities is due to karman.\nThus, in order to account for the origination of different effects we must\nnecessarily assume the connexion of an intelligent agent with karman, whereby\nalone he can become the cause of effects; and moreover the various character\nof knowledge and power (which the various effects presuppose) has its reason\nin karman. And if it be said that\n\np. 172\n\nit is (not the various knowledge, &c., but) the mere wish of the agent that\ncauses the origination of effects, we point out that the wish, as being\nspecialised by its particular object, must be based on sattva and so on, and\nhence is necessarily connected with karman. From all this it follows that\nindividual souls only can be causal agents: no legitimate inference leads to a\nLord different from them in nature.--This admits of various expressions in\ntechnical form. 'Bodies, worlds, &c., are effects due to the causal energy of\nindividual souls, just as pots are'; 'the Lord is not a causal agent, because\nhe has no aims; just as the released souls have none'; 'the Lord is not an\nagent, because he has no body; just as the released souls have none.' (This\nlast argumentation cannot be objected to on the ground that individual souls\ntake possession of bodies; for in their case there exists a beginningless\nsubtle body by means of which they enter into gross bodies).--'Time is never\ndevoid of created worlds; because it is time, just like the present time\n(which has its created world).'\n\nConsider the following point also. Does the Lord produce his effects, with his\nbody or apart from his body? Not the latter; for we do not observe causal\nagency on the part of any bodiless being: even the activities of the internal\norgan are found only in beings having a body, and although the internal organ\nbe eternal we do not know of its producing any effects in the case of released\ndisembodied souls. Nor again is the former alternative admissible; for in that\ncase the Lord's body would either be permanent or non-permanent. The former\nalternative would imply that something made up of parts is eternal; and if we\nonce admit this we may as well admit that the world itself is eternal, and\nthen there is no reason to infer a Lord. And the latter alternative is\ninadmissible because in that case there would be no cause of the body,\ndifferent from it (which would account for the origination of the body). Nor\ncould the Lord himself be assumed as the cause of the body, since a bodiless\nbeing cannot be the cause of a body. Nor could it be maintained that the Lord\ncan be assumed to be 'embodied' by means of some other body; for this\n\np. 173\n\nleads us into a _regressus in infinitum._ \\--Should we, moreover, represent to\nourselves the Lord (when productive) as engaged in effort or not?--The former\nis inadmissible, because he is without a body. And the latter alternative is\nexcluded because a being not making an effort does not produce effects. And if\nit be said that the effect, i.e. the world, has for its causal agent one whose\nactivity consists in mere desire, this would be to ascribe to the subject of\nthe conclusion (i.e. the world) qualities not known from experience; and\nmoreover the attribute to be proved would be absent in the case of the proving\ninstances (such as jars, &c., which are not the work of agents engaged in mere\nwishing). Thus the inference of a creative Lord which claims to be in\nagreement with observation is refuted by reasoning which itself is in\nagreement with observation, and we hence conclude that Scripture is the only\nsource of knowledge with regard to a supreme soul that is the Lord of all and\nconstitutes the highest Brahman. What Scripture tells us of is a being which\ncomprehends within itself infinite, altogether unsurpassable excellences such\nas omnipotence and so on, is antagonistic to all evil, and totally different\nin character from whatever is cognised by the other means of knowledge: that\nto such a being there should attach even the slightest imperfection due to its\nsimilarity in nature to the things known by the ordinary means of knowledge,\nis thus altogether excluded.--The Purvapakshin had remarked that the oneness\nof the instrumental and the material cause is neither matter of observation\nnor capable of proof, and that the same holds good with regard to the theory\nthat certain non-composite substances such as ether are created things; that\nthese points also are in no way contrary to reason, we shall show later on\nunder Su. I, 4, 23, and Su. II, 3, 1.\n\nThe conclusion meanwhile is that, since Brahman does not fall within the\nsphere of the other means of knowledge, and is the topic of Scripture only,\nthe text 'from whence these creatures,' &c., _does_ give authoritative\ninformation as to a Brahman possessing the characteristic qualities so often\nenumerated. Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'Scripture being the\nsource.'\n\np. 174\n\nA new objection here presents itself.--Brahman does not indeed fall within the\nprovince of the other means of knowledge; but all the same Scripture does not\ngive authoritative information regarding it: for Brahman is not something that\nhas for its purport activity or cessation from activity, but is something\nfully established and accomplished within itself.--To this objection the\nfollowing Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[168:1](sbe48036.htm#fr_27) A certain potter may not possess the skill and\nknowledge required to make chairs and beds; but some other potter may possess\nboth, and so on. We cannot therefore point to any definite want of skill and\nknowledge as invariably accompanying the capability of producing effects of\nsome other kind.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
