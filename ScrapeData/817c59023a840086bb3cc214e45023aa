Each thought he was at their side, and did not recognize him near any\none else. They placed their fingers within his fingers, and whirled about with\nthe greatest enjoyment, taking Huri with them. The son of Nund in the midst of\nthe cowherdesses was like thick masses of clouds, surrounded on all sides by\nlightning. The dark-blue Krishnu amongst the fair women of Bruj was like a\nsapphire on a necklace of gold.\n\np. 114\n\nO great king! standing thus together, the cowherdesses and Krishnu began to\ntune various kinds of musical instruments, preluding difficult airs, and\nplayed and sang, producing great varieties of tone, and singing whilst they\ndanced. And so delighted were they, that they seemed to lose all recollection\nof their very existence. Sometimes the breast of one was uncovered, and the\ndiadem of another slipped off. At one place, the pearl necklaces of some were\nbroken, and the pearls fell on the ground: at another, garlands of flowers\nwere strewed about. The drops of perspiration on their foreheads glittered\nlike strings of pearls; and the ringlets of the cowherdesses were spread in\nsuch a loose and dishevelled manner over their faces, that they resembled\nyoung snakes, who had flown up, and then become fastened to the moon, from an\neager desire to obtain the water of life.\n\nSometimes a cowherdess, singing in high tones, accompanied Krishnu\'s flute:\nand sometimes one of them sang without accompaniment. And when any one of\nthem, having stopped Krishnu\'s flute, poured forth the same notes from her own\nvoice, he was as much fascinated as a child on beholding its own image in a\nmirror.\n\nThus singing and dancing, and practising all kinds of coquetry and ogling,\nthey passed the hours in mutual enjoyment, and being pleased with each other,\nthey laughed and embraced and made a propitiatory offering of their dresses\nand ornaments. At that time, Bruhmu, Roodru, Indru and all the gods and\ncelestial musicians, seated in their chariots with their wives, looked down\nupon the festivities, and showered down flowers with delight. And the wives,\ngazing on this scene of pleasure with eager desire, thought to themselves,\nthat if they could be born in Bruj, they also might join in festivities with\nHuri. And to such a pitch were the musical notes and tones carried, that on\nhearing them, the air was stilled, and water ceased to flow; and the moon,\ntogether with the whole of the stars, was astonished, and poured down the\nwater of life from its rays.\n\np. 115\n\n[paragraph continues] The night was prolonged so that six months passed away,\nwhence that night was named, Bruhmu\'s night.\n\nHaving proceeded thus far with the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O lord\nof the earth! whilst engaged in these festive sports, a whim seized Krishnu,\nand he went with the cowherdesses to the banks of the Jumna. Going into the\nwater and engaging in aquatic pastimes, after he had got rid of his fatigue,\nhe came out; and having accomplished the wishes of them all, said to them,\n"There are four ghurees of the night remaining; go all of you to your homes."\nThe cowherdesses were sad at these words, and said, "Lord! how shall we go\nhome, leaving your lotus-like feet? Our greedy minds do not approve of what\nyou have suggested." Shree Krishnu replied, "Meditate on me in the manner that\nreligious devotees meditate; and wherever you may be, I will always be with\nyou." They were gratified at these words, and taking leave returned home; and\nno one at their houses was aware that they had not been all along at their\nrespective house.\n\nHaving heard thus much of the history, Raja Pureechit said to Shree Shookdeo,\nthe sage,--"O kind to the poor! Shree Krishnu Chund had come upon the earth to\ndestroy evil spirits, and remove the burthens of the world, and, having\nconferred happiness on saints and religious men, to promote piety. Explain to\nme, why he engaged in festivities with other men\'s wives; as it is the act of\na dissolute person to enjoy himself with another man\'s wife?" Shookdeo Jee\nreplied, Raja! you do not understand this mystery, and regard the deity as a\nmortal. His body is glorious and pure, by remembrance of whom sin is\nobliterated, just as any thing falling into fire, itself becomes fire.\n\nWhat cannot the powerful do? because by their acts they overcome fate: as\nShivu took poison, and after having taken it made of it an ornament for his\nneck, and formed a black snake into a necklace. Who can understand his\nactions? Beings with\n\np. 116\n\npower do nothing for themselves, but confer boons on all petitioners, who\nworship and hold them in remembrance.\n\nThe nature of Krishnu is this; that he seems to associate with all: but if you\nconsider, you will perceive, that he appears as separate as the lotus leaf\nfrom the water. I have already narrated to you the history of the\ncowherdesses\' birth, and that Dewee and the mystical prayers of the Vedas were\nborn, and came to Bruj to see and touch Huri. And in this manner Shree Radhika\nalso, having obtained a blessing from Bruhmu, was born to be a servant to\nKrishnu Chund; and remained in the service of her master.\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee continued, O great king! we are told to believe all the\nacts that Krishnu performed, but not to turn our thoughts to the manner in\nwhich, and the means by which, they were performed. Whoever celebrates the\nfame of the lord of the cowherdesses, obtains, fearless and unmoved, the\nhighest dignity. And the same benefits which are procured by bathing in the\nsixty-eight places of pilgrimage, are procured by celebrating the great renown\nof Shree Krishnu.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXV](psa36.htm)\n\n'
