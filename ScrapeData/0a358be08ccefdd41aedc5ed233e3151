The abode of heaven, earth, &c. (is the highest Self), on account of terms\nwhich are its own.\n\nThe followers of the Atharva-veda have the following text, 'He in whom the\nheaven, the earth and the sky are woven, the mind also, with all the vital\nairs, know him alone as the Self, and leave off other words; he is the bank\n(setu) of the Immortal' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 5). The doubt here arises whether the\nbeing spoken of as the abode of heaven, earth, and so on, is the individual\nsoul or the highest Self.\n\nThe Purvapakshin maintains the former alternative. For, he remarks, in the\nnext _s_ loka, 'where like spokes in the nave of a wheel the arteries meet, he\nmoves about within, becoming manifold, 'the word 'where' refers back to the\nbeing which in the preceding _s_ loka had been called the abode of heaven,\nearth, and so on, the clause beginning with 'where' thus declaring that that\nbeing is the basis of the arteries; and the next clause declares that same\nbeing to become manifold or to be born in many ways. Now, connexion with the\narteries is clearly characteristic of the individual soul; and so is being\nborn in many forms, divine and so on. Moreover, in the very _s_ loka under\ndiscussion it is said that that being is the abode of the mind and the five\nvital airs, and this also is a characteristic attribute of the individual\nsoul. It being, on these grounds, ascertained that the text refers to the\nindividual soul we must attempt to reconcile therewith, as well as we can,\nwhat is said about its being the abode of heaven, earth, &c.\n\nThis prima facie view is set aside by the Sutra. That which is described as\nthe abode of heaven, earth, &c. is none other than the highest Brahman, on\naccount of a term which is 'its own,' i.e. which specially belongs to it. The\nclause we have in view is 'he is the bank of the Immortal.' This description\napplies to the highest Brahman only, which\n\np. 297\n\nalone is, in all Upanishads, termed the cause of the attainment of\nImmortality; cp. e.g. 'Knowing him thus a man becomes immortal; there is no\nother path to go' ( _S_ ve. Up. III, 8). The term 'setu' is derived from _si_\n, which means to bind, and therefore means that which binds, i.e. makes one to\nattain immortality; or else it may be understood to mean that which leads\ntowards immortality that lies beyond the ocean of sa _m_ sara, in the same way\nas a bank or bridge (setu) leads to the further side of a river.--Moreover the\nword 'Self (atman) (which, in the text under discussion, is also applied to\nthat which is the abode of heaven, earth. &c.), without any further\nqualification, primarily denotes Brahman only; for 'atman' comes from _a p_,\nto reach, and means that which 'reaches' all other things in so far as it\nrules them. And further on (II, 2, 7) there are other terms, 'all knowing,'\n'all cognising,' which also specially belong to the highest Brahman only. This\nBrahman may also be represented as the abode of the arteries; as proved e.g.\nby Mahanar. Up. (XI, 8-12), 'Surrounded by the arteries he hangs... in the\nmiddle of this pointed flame there dwells the highest Self.' Of that Self it\nmay also be said that it is born in many ways; in accordance with texts such\nas 'not born, he is born in many ways; the wise know the place of his birth.'\nFor in order to fit himself to be a refuge for gods, men, &c. the supreme\nPerson, without however putting aside his true nature, associates himself with\nthe shape, make, qualities and works of the different classes of beings, and\nthus is born in many ways. Sm _ri_ ti says the same: 'Though being unborn, of\nnon-perishable nature, the Lord of all beings, yet presiding over my Prak _ri_\nti I am born by my own mysterious power' (Bha. Gi. IV, 6). Of the mind also\nand the other organs of the individual soul the highest Self is strictly the\nabode; for it is the abode of everything.--The next Sutra supplies a further\nreason.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
