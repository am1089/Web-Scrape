I must go in and find\nmy mistress. [ _She walks about and looks around her_.] There is my mistress.\nShe is painting a picture, and putting her whole heart into it. I must go and\nspeak to her.\n\n[ _Then appear the love-lorn Vasantasen \xc4\x81, seated, and Madanik\xc4\x81_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Well, girl, and then\xc2\x97\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. But mistress, you were not speaking of anything. What do you\nmean?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Why, what did I say?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. You said, "and then"\xc2\x97\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Puckering her brows_.] Oh, yes. So I did.\n\n_Maid_. [ _Approaching_.] Mistress, your mother sends word that you should\nbathe and then offer worship to the gods.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. You may tell my mother that I shall not take the ceremonial\nbath to-day. A Brahman must offer worship in my place.\n\n_Maid_. Yes, mistress.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. My dear mistress, it is love, not naughtiness, that asks the\nquestion\xc2\x97but what does this mean?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Tell me, Madanik\xc4\x81. How do I seem to you?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. My mistress is so absent-minded that I know her heart is filled\nwith longing for somebody.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Well guessed. My Madanik\xc4\x81 is quick to fathom another\'s heart.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. I am very, very glad. Yes, K\xc4\x81ma is indeed mighty, and\n\np. 28\n\nhis great festival is welcome when one is young. But tell me, mistress, is it\na king, or a king\'s favorite, whom you worship?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Girl, I wish to love, not to worship.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Is it a Brahman that excites your passion, some youth\ndistinguished for very particular learning?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. A Brahman I should have to reverence.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Or is it some young merchant, grown enormously wealthy from\nvisiting many cities?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. A merchant, girl, must go to other countries and leave you\nbehind, no matter how much you love him. And the separation makes you very\nsad.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. It isn\'t a king, nor a favorite, nor a Brahman, nor a merchant.\nWho is it then that the princess loves?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Girl! Girl! You went with me to the park where K\xc4\x81ma\'s temple\nstands?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Yes, mistress.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. And yet you ask, as if you were a perfect stranger.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Now I know. Is it the man who comforted you when you asked to be\nprotected?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Well, what was his name?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Why, he lives in the merchants\xc2\x92 quarter.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. But I asked you for his name.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. His name, mistress, is a good omen in itself. His name is\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Joyfully_.] Good, Madanik\xc4\x81, good. You have guessed it.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Aside_.] So much for that. [ _Aloud_.] Mistress, they say he\nis poor.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. That is the very reason why I love him. For a courtezan who\nsets her heart on a poor man is blameless in the eyes of the world.\n\np. 29\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. But mistress, do the butterflies visit the mango-tree when its\nblossoms have fallen?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. That is just why we call that sort of a girl a butterfly.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Well, mistress, if you love him, why don\'t you go and visit him\nat once?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Girl, if I should visit him at once, then, because he can\'t\nmake any return\xc2\x97no, I don\'t mean that, but it would be hard to see him.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Is that the reason why you left your jewels with him?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. You have guessed it.\n\n\n\n_A voice_  1 _behind the scenes_. Oh, sir, a shampooer owes me ten gold-\npieces, and he got away from us. Hold him, hold him! [ _To the fleeing\nshampooer_.] Stop, stop! I see you from here. [ _Enter hurriedly a frightened\nshampooer_.]\n\n_Shampooer_. Oh, confound this gambling business!\n\nFreed from its tether, the ace\xc2\x97  \nI might better say "ass"\xc2\x97how it kicks me!  \nAnd the cast of the dice called the "spear"  \nProves true to its name; for it sticks me.1  \nThe keeper\'s whole attention  \nWas busy with the score;  \nSo it took no great invention  \nTo vanish through the door.  \nBut I cannot stand forever  \nIn the unprotected street.  \nIs there no one to deliver?  \nI would fall before his feet.2\n\nWhile the keeper and the gambler are looking somewhere else for me, I\'ll just\nwalk backwards into this empty temple and turn goddess. [ _He makes all sorts\nof gestures, takes his place, and waits. Enter M \xc4\x81thura and the gambler_.]\n\np. 30\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Oh, sir, a shampooer owes me ten gold-pieces, and he got away from\nus. Hold him, hold him! Stop, stop! I see you from here.\n\n_Gambler_. You may run to hell, if they\'ll take you in;\n\n  With Indra, the god, you may stay:  \nFor there\'s never a god can save your skin,  \n  While M\xc4\x81thura wants his pay.3\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Oh, whither flee you, nimble rambler,\n\nYou that cheat an honest gambler?  \nYou that shake with fear and shiver,  \nAll a-tremble, all a-quiver;  \nYou that cannot trip enough,  \nOn the level ground and rough;  \nYou that stain your social station,  \nFamily, and reputation!4\n\n_Gambler_. [ _Examining the footprints_.] Here he goes. And here the tracks\nare lost.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. [ _Gazes at the footprints. Reflectively_.] Look! The feet are\nturned around. And the temple hasn\'t any image. [ _After a moment\'s thought_.]\nThat rogue of a shampooer has gone into the temple with his feet turned\naround.\n\n_Gambler_. Let\'s follow him.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. All right. [ _They enter the temple and take a good look, then\nmake signs to each other_.]\n\n_Gambler_. What! a wooden image?\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Of course not. It\'s stone. [ _He shakes it with all his might,\nthen makes signs_.] What do we care? Come, let\'s have a game. [ _He starts to\ngamble as hard as he can_.]\n\n_Shampooer_. [ _Trying with all his might to repress the gambling fever.\nAside_.] Oh, oh!\n\nOh, the rattle of dice is a charming thing,  \n  When you haven\'t a copper left; p. 31  \nIt works like a drum on the heart of a king,  \n  Of all his realm bereft.5\n\nFor gamblers leap down a mountain steep\xc2\x97  \n  I know I shall not play.  \nYet the rattle of dice is as sweet as the peep  \n  Of nightingales in May.6\n\n_Gambler_. My turn, my turn!\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Not much! it\'s my turn.\n\n_Shampooer_. [ _Coming up quickly from behind_.] Isn\'t it my turn?\n\n_Gambler_. We\'ve got our man.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. [ _Seizing him_.] You jail-bird, you\'re caught. Pay me my ten\ngold-pieces.\n\n_Shampooer_. I\'ll pay you this very day.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Pay me this very minute!\n\n_Shampooer_. I\'ll pay you. Only have mercy!\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Come, will you pay me now?\n\n_Shampooer_. My head is getting dizzy. [ _He falls to the ground. The others\nbeat him with all their might_.]\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. There [ _drawing the gamblers \xc2\x92 ring_] you\'re bound by the\ngamblers\xc2\x92 ring.\n\n_Shampooer_. [ _Rises. Despairingly_.] What! bound by the gamblers\xc2\x92 ring?\nConfound it! That is a limit which we gamblers can\'t pass. Where can I get the\nmoney to pay him?\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Well then, you must give surety.\n\n_Shampooer_. I have an idea. [ _He nudges the gambler_.] I\'ll give you half,\nif you\'ll forgive me the other half.\n\n_Gambler_. All right.\n\n_Shampooer_. [ _To M \xc4\x81thura_.] I\'ll give you surety for a half. You might\nforgive me the other half.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. All right. Where\'s the harm?\n\n_Shampooer_. [ _Aloud_.] You forgave me a half, sir?\n\np. 32\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Yes.\n\n_Shampooer_. [ _To the gambler_.] And you forgave me a half?\n\n_Gambler_. Yes.\n\n_Shampooer_. Then I think I\'ll be going.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Pay me my ten gold-pieces! Where are you going?\n\n_Shampooer_. Look at this, gentlemen, look at this! Here I just gave surety to\none of them for a half, and the other forgave me a half. And even after that\nhe is dunning me, poor helpless me!\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. [ _Seizing him_.] My name is M\xc4\x81thura, the clever swindler, and\nyou\'re not going to swindle me this time. Pay up, jail-bird, every bit of my\nmoney, and this minute, too.\n\n_Shampooer_. How can I pay?\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Sell your father and pay.\n\n_Shampooer_. Where can I get a father?\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Sell your mother and pay.\n\n_Shampooer_. Where can I get a mother?\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Sell yourself and pay.\n\n_Shampooer_. Have mercy! Lead me to the king\'s highway.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Go ahead.\n\n_Shampooer_. If it must be. [ _He walks about_.] Gentlemen, will you buy me\nfor ten gold-pieces from this gambling-master? [ _He sees a passer-by and\ncalls out_.] What is that? You wish to know what I can do? I will be your\nhouse-servant. What! he has gone without even answering. Well, here\'s another.\nI\'ll speak to him. [ _He repeats his offer_.] What! this one too takes no\nnotice of me. He is gone. Confound it! I\'ve had hard luck ever since\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta lost his fortune.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Will you pay?\n\n_Shampooer_. How can I pay? [ _He falls down. M \xc4\x81thura drags him about_.] Good\ngentlemen, save me, save me! [ _Enter Darduraka_.]\n\n_Darduraka_. Yes, gambling is a kingdom without a throne.\n\np. 33\n\nYou do not mind defeat at all;  \nGreat are the sums you spend and win;  \nWhile kingly revenues roll in,  \nRich men, like slaves, before you fall.7\n\nAnd again:\n\nYou earn your coin by gambling,  \nYour friends and wife by gambling,  \nYour gifts and food by gambling;  \nYour last cent goes by gambling.8\n\nAnd again:\n\nMy cash was taken by the trey;  \nThe deuce then took my health away;  \nThe ace then set me on the street;  \nThe four completed my defeat.9\n\n[ _He looks before him_.] Here comes M\xc4\x81thura, our sometime gambling-master.\nWell, as I can\'t escape, I think I\'ll put on my veil. [ _He makes any number\nof gestures with his cloak, then examines it_.]\n\nThis cloth is sadly indigent in thread;  \n  This lovely cloth lets in a lot of light;  \nThis cloth\'s protective power is nearly fled;  \n  This cloth is pretty when it\'s rolled up tight.10\n\nYet after all, what more could a poor saint do? For you see,\n\nOne foot I\'ve planted in the sky,  \nThe other on the ground must lie. 1  \nThe elevation\'s rather high,  \nBut the sun stands it. Why can\'t I?11\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Pay, pay!\n\n_Shampooer_. How can I pay? [ _M \xc4\x81thura drags him about_.]\n\n_Darduraka_. Well, well, what is this I see? [ _He addresses a bystander_.]\nWhat did you say, sir? "This shampooer is being maltreated by the gambling-\nmaster, and no one will save him"? I\'ll save him myself. [ _He presses\nforward_.] Stand back, stand back!\n\np. 34\n\n[ _He takes a look_.] Well, if this isn\'t that swindler M\xc4\x81thura. And here is\nthe poor saintly shampooer; a saint to be sure,\n\nWho does not hang with bended head  \n  Rigid till set of sun,  \nWho does not rub his back with sand  \n  Till boils begin to run,  \nWhose shins dogs may not browse upon,  \n  As they pass him in their rambling. 1  \nWhy should this tall and dainty man  \n  Be so in love with gambling?12\n\nWell, I must pacify M\xc4\x81thura. [ _He approaches_.] How do you do, M\xc4\x81thura? [ _M\n\xc4\x81thura returns the greeting_.]\n\n_Darduraka_. What does this mean?\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. He owes me ten gold-pieces.\n\n_Darduraka_. A mere bagatelle!\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. [ _Pulling the rolled-up cloak from under Darduraka\'s arm_.] Look,\ngentlemen, look! The man in the ragged cloak calls ten gold-pieces a mere\nbagatelle.\n\n_Darduraka_. My good fool, don\'t I risk ten gold-pieces on a cast of the dice?\nSuppose a man has money\xc2\x97is that any reason why he should put it in his bosom\nand show it? But you,\n\nYou\'ll lose your caste, you\'ll lose your soul,  \nFor ten gold-pieces that he stole,  \nTo kill a man that\'s sound and whole,  \n  With five good senses in him.13\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Ten gold-pieces may be a mere bagatelle to you, sir. To me they\nare a fortune.\n\n_Darduraka_. Well then, listen to me. Just give him ten more, and let him go\nto gambling again.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. And what then?\n\n_Darduraka_. If he wins, he will pay you.\n\np. 35\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. And if he doesn\'t win?\n\n_Darduraka_. Then he won\'t pay you.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. This is no time for nonsense. If you say that, you can give him\nthe money yourself. My name is M\xc4\x81thura. I\'m a swindler and I play a crooked\ngame, and I\'m not afraid of anybody. You are an immoral scoundrel.\n\n_Darduraka_. Who did you say was immoral?\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. You\'re immoral.\n\n_Darduraka_. Your father is immoral. [He gives the shampooer a sign to\nescape.]\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. You cur! That is just the way that you gamble.\n\n_Darduraka_. That is the way I gamble?\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Come, shampooer, pay me my ten gold-pieces.\n\n_Shampooer_. I\'ll pay you this very day. I\'ll pay at once. [M\xc4\x81thura drags him\nabout.]\n\n_Darduraka_. Fool! You may maltreat him when I am away, but not before my\neyes.\n\n[ _M \xc4\x81thura seizes the shampooer and hits him on the nose. The shampooer\nbleeds, faints, and falls flat. Darduraka approaches and interferes. M\xc4\x81thura\nstrikes Darduraka, and Darduraka strikes back_.]\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Oh, oh, you accursed hound! But I\'ll pay you for this.\n\n_Darduraka_. My good fool, I was walking peaceably along the street, and you\nstruck me. If you strike me to-morrow in court, then you will open your eyes.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Yes, I\'ll open my eyes.\n\n_Darduraka_. How will you open your eyes?\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. [ _Opening his eyes wide_.] This is the way I\'ll open my eyes.\n[Darduraka throws dust in M\xc4\x81thura\'s eyes, and gives the shampooer a sign to\nescape. M\xc4\x81thura shuts his eyes and falls down. The shampooer escapes.]\n\np. 36\n\n_Darduraka_. [ _Aside_.] I have made an enemy of the influential gambling-\nmaster M\xc4\x81thura. I had better not stay here. Besides, my good friend Sharvilaka\ntold me that a young herdsman named Aryaka has been designated by a soothsayer\nas our future king. Now everybody in my condition is running after him. I\nthink I will join myself to him.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n\n\n_Shampooer_. [ _Trembles as he walks away and looks about him_.] Here is a\nhouse where somebody has left the side-door open. I will go in. [ _He enters\nand perceives Vasantasen \xc4\x81_.] Madam, I throw myself upon your protection.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. He who throws himself upon my protection shall be safe. Close\nthe door, girl. [ _The maid does so_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. What do you fear?\n\n_Shampooer_. A creditor, madam.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. You may open the door now, girl.\n\n_Shampooer_. [ _To himself_.] Ah! Her reasons for not fearing a creditor are\nin proportion to her innocence. The proverb is right:\n\nThe man who knows his strength and bears a load  \n  Proportioned to that strength, not more nor less,  \n  Is safe from stumbling and from sore distress,  \nAlthough he wander on a dreary road.14\n\nThat means me.\n\n\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. [ _Wiping his eyes. To the gambler_.] Pay, pay!\n\n_Gambler_. While we were quarreling with Darduraka, sir, the man escaped.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. I broke that shampooer\'s nose for him with my fist. Come on! Let\'s\ntrace him by the blood. [ _They do so_.]\n\n_Gambler_. He went into Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s house, sir.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. Then that is the end of the gold-pieces.\n\n_Gambler_. Let\'s go to court and lodge a complaint.\n\np. 37\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. The swindler would leave the house and escape. No, we must besiege\nhim and so capture him.\n\n\n\n[ _Vasantasen \xc4\x81 gives Madanik\xc4\x81 a sign_.]\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Whence are you, sir? or who are you, sir? or whose son are you,\nsir? or what is your business, sir? or what are you afraid of?\n\n_Shampooer_. Listen, madam. My birthplace is P\xc4\x81taliputra, madam. I am the son\nof a householder. I practise the trade of a shampooer. Vasantasen\xc4\x81. It is a\nvery dainty art, sir, which you have mastered.\n\n_Shampooer_. Madam, as an art I mastered it. It has now become a mere trade.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Your answers are most disconsolate, sir. Pray continue.\n\n_Shampooer_. Yes, madam. When I was at home, I used to hear travelers tell\ntales, and I wanted to see new countries, and so I came here. And when I had\ncome here to Ujjayin\xc4\xab, I became the servant of a noble gentleman. Such a\nhandsome, courteous gentleman! When he gave money away, he did not boast; when\nhe was injured, he forgot it. To cut a long story short: he was so courteous\nthat he regarded his own person as the possession of others, and had\ncompassion on all who sought his protection.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Who may it be that adorns Ujjayin\xc4\xab with the virtues which he has\nstolen from the object of my mistress\xc2\x92 desires?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Good, girl, good! I had the same thought in mind.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. But to continue, sir\n\n_Shampooer_. Madam, he was so compassionate and so generous that now\xc2\x97\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. His riches have vanished?\n\n_Shampooer_. I didn\'t say it. How did you guess it, madam?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. What was there to guess? Virtue and money seldom keep company.\nIn the pools from which men cannot drink there is so much the more water.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. But sir, what is his name?\n\np. 38\n\n_Shampooer_. Madam, who does not know the name of this moon of the whole\nworld? He lives in the merchants\xc2\x92 quarter. He whose name is worthy of all\nhonor is named Ch\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Joyfully rising from her seat_.] Sir, this house is your\nown. Give him a seat, girl, and take this fan. The gentleman is weary. [\n_Madanik \xc4\x81 does as she is bid_.]\n\n_Shampooer_. [ _Aside_.] What! so much honor because I mentioned Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s\nname? Heaven bless you, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta! You are the only man in the world who\nreally lives. All others merely breathe. [ _He falls at Vasantasen \xc4\x81\'s feet_.]\nEnough, madam, enough. Pray be seated, madam.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [Seating herself.] Where is he who is so richly your creditor,\nsir?\n\n_Shamp_. The good man\'s wealth consists in kindly deeds;\n\n  All other wealth is vain and quickly flies.  \nThe man who honors not his neighbor\'s needs,  \n  Does that man know what honor signifies?15\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. But to continue\xc2\x97\n\n_Shampooer_. So I became a servant in his employ. And when his wealth was\nreduced to his virtue, I began to live by gambling. But fate was cruel, and I\nlost ten gold-pieces.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. I am ruined! I am robbed!\n\n_Shampooer_. There are the gambling-master and the gambler, looking for me.\nYou have heard my story, madam. The rest is your affair.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Madanik\xc4\x81, the birds fly everywhither when the tree is shaken\nin which they have their nests. Go, girl, and give the gambling-master and the\ngambler this bracelet. And tell them that this gentleman sends it. [ _She\nremoves a bracelet from her arm, and gives it to Madanik \xc4\x81_.]\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Receiving the bracelet_.] Yes, mistress. [ _She goes out_.]\n\np. 39\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. I am ruined! I am robbed!\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Inasmuch as these two are looking up to heaven, and sighing, and\nchattering, and fastening their eyes on the door, I conclude that they must be\nthe gambling-master and the gambler. [ _Approaching_.] I salute you, sir.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. May happiness be yours.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Sir, which of you is the gambling-master?\n\n_M \xc4\x81th_. O maiden, fair but something less than shy,\n\n  With red lip wounded in love\'s ardent play,  \nOn whom is bent that sweet, coquettish eye?  \n  For whom that lisp that steals the heart away?16\n\nI haven\'t got any money. You\'ll have to look somewhere else.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. You are certainly no gambler, if you talk that way. Is there any\none who owes you money?\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. There is. He owes ten gold-pieces. What of him?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. In his behalf my mistress sends you this bracelet. No, no! He\nsends it himself.\n\n_M \xc4\x81thura_. [ _Seizing it joyfully_.] Well, well, you may tell the noble youth\nthat his account is squared. Let him come and seek delight again in gambling.\n\n[ _Exeunt M \xc4\x81thura and the gambler_.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Returning to Vasantasen \xc4\x81_.] Mistress, the gambling-master and\nthe gambler have gone away well-pleased.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Go, sir, and comfort your kinsfolk.\n\n_Shampooer_. Ah, madam, if it may be, these hands would gladly practise their\nart in your service.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. But sir, he for whose sake you mastered the art, who first\nreceived your service, he should have your service still.\n\n_Shampooer_. [ _Aside_.] A very pretty way to decline my services. How shall I\nrepay her kindness? [Aloud.] Madam, thus dishonored as a gambler, I shall\nbecome a Buddhist monk. And so,\n\np. 40\n\nmadam, treasure these words in your memory: "He was a shampooer, a gambler, a\nBuddhist monk."\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Sir, you must not act too precipitately.\n\n_Shampooer_. Madam, my mind is made up. [ _He walks about_.]\n\nI gambled, and in gambling I did fall,  \n  Till every one beheld me with dismay.  \nNow I shall show my honest face to all,  \n  And walk abroad upon the king\'s highway.17\n\n[ _Tumultuous cries behind the scenes_.]\n\n_Shampooer_. [ _Listening_.] What is this? What is this? [ _Addressing some\none behind the scenes_.] What did you say? "Post-breaker, Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s rogue\nelephant, is at liberty!" Hurrah! I must go and see the lady\'s best elephant.\nNo, no! What have I to do with these things? I must hold to my resolution.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n[ _Then enter hastily Karnap \xc5\xabraka, highly delighted, wearing a gorgeous\nmantle_.]\n\n_Karnap \xc5\xabraka_. Where is she? Where is my mistress?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Insolent! What can it be that so excites you? You do not see your\nmistress before your very eyes.\n\n_Karnap \xc5\xabraka_. [ _Perceiving Vasantasen \xc4\x81_.] Mistress, my service to you.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Karnap\xc5\xabraka, your face is beaming. What is it?\n\n_Karnap \xc5\xabraka_. [ _Proudly_.] Oh, mistress! You missed it! You didn\'t see\nKarnap\xc5\xabraka\'s heroism to-day!\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. What, Karnap\xc5\xabraka, what?\n\n_Karnap \xc5\xabraka_. Listen. Post-breaker, my mistress\xc2\x92 rogue elephant, broke the\nstake he was tied to, killed his keeper, and ran into the street, making a\nterrible commotion. You should have heard the people shriek,\n\nTake care of the babies, as quick as you can,  \n  And climb up a roof or a tree! p. 41  \nThe elephant rogue wants the blood of a man.  \n  Escape! Run away! Can\'t you see?18\n\nAnd:\n\nHow they lose their ankle-rings!  \nGirdles, set with gems and things,  \nBreak away from fastenings!\n\nAs they stumble, trip, and blunder,  \nSee the bracelets snap asunder,  \nEach a tangled, pearly wonder!19\n\nAnd that rogue of an elephant dives with his trunk and his feet and his tusks\ninto the city of Ujjayin\xc4\xab, as if it were a lotus-pond in full flower. At last\nhe comes upon a Buddhist monk. 1 And while the man\'s staff and his water jar\nand his begging-bowl fly every which way, he drizzles water over him and gets\nhim between his tusks. The people see him and begin to shriek again, crying\n"Oh, oh, the monk is killed!"\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Anxiously_.] Oh, what carelessness, what carelessness!\n\n_Karnap \xc5\xabraka_. Don\'t be frightened. Just listen, mistress. Then, with a big\npiece of the broken chain dangling about him, he picked him up, picked up the\nmonk between his tusks, and just then Karnap\xc5\xabraka saw him, I saw him, no, no!\nthe slave who grows fat on my mistress\' rice-cakes saw him, stumbled with his\nleft foot over a gambler\'s score, grabbed up an iron pole out of a shop, and\nchallenged the mad elephant\xc2\x97\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Go on! Go on!\n\n_Karnap_. I hit him\xc2\x97in a fit of passion, too\xc2\x97\n\n  He really looked like some great mountain peak.  \nAnd from between those tusks of his I drew  \n  The sacred hermit meek.20\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Splendid, splendid! But go on!\n\n_Karnap \xc5\xabraka_. Then, mistress, all Ujjayin\xc4\xab tipped over to one side,\n\np. 42\n\nlike a ship loaded unevenly, and you could hear nothing but "Hurrah, hurrah\nfor Karnap\xc5\xabraka!" Then, mistress, a man touched the places where he ought to\nhave ornaments, and, finding that he hadn\'t any, looked up, heaved a long\nsigh, and threw this mantle over me.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Find out, Karnap\xc5\xabraka, whether the mantle is perfumed with\njasmine or not.\n\n_Karnap \xc5\xabraka_. Mistress, the elephant perfume is so strong that I can\'t tell\nfor sure.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Then look at the name.\n\n_Karnap \xc5\xabraka_. Here is the name. You may read it, mistress. [ _He hands her\nthe mantle_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Reads_.] Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. [ _She seizes the mantle eagerly and\nwraps it about her_.]\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. The mantle is very becoming to her, Karnap\xc5\xabraka.\n\n_Karnap \xc5\xabraka_. Oh, yes, the mantle is becoming enough.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Here is your reward, Karnap\xc5\xabraka. [ _She gives him a gem_.]\n\n_Karnap \xc5\xabraka_. [ _Taking it and bowing low_.] Now the mantle is most\nwonderfully becoming.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Karnap\xc5\xabraka, where is Ch\xc4\x81rudatta now?\n\n_Karnap \xc5\xabraka_. He started to go home along this very street.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Come, girl! Let us go to the upper balcony and see Ch\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\n[ _Exeunt omnes_.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[27:1](lcc08.htm#fr_38) Perhaps masseur would be more accurate.\n\n[29:1](lcc08.htm#fr_39) That of M\xc4\x81thura, the keeper of the gambling-house.\n\n[33:1](lcc08.htm#fr_40) A humorously exaggerated reference to Indian ascetic\npractices.\n\n[34:1](lcc08.htm#fr_41) See note on page 33.\n\n[41:1](lcc08.htm#fr_42) The shampooer, whose transformation is astonishingly\nsudden.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act the Third: The Hole in the Wall](lcc09.htm)\n\n'
