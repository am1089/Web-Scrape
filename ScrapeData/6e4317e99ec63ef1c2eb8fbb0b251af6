Now when at that Triratra 1 sacrifice he gives those thousand\n(cows), then that one is made the one-thousandth 2. On the first day he brings\nthree hundred and thirty-three; and likewise on the second day he brings three\nhundred and thirty-three; and likewise on the third day he brings three\nhundred and thirty-three. Then that one-thousandth is left over.\n\n4:5:8:22\\. She should be three-coloured, they say, for that is the most\nperfect form for her. But let it be a red one, and spotted, for that indeed is\nthe most perfect form for her.\n\n4:5:8:33\\. Let it be one that has not been approached (by a bull), for she,\nthe Sahasri, is in reality Va _k_ (speech); but Va _k_ , forsooth, is of\nunimpaired vigour, and so is one of unimpaired vigour which has not been\napproached: therefore it should be one that has not been approached.\n\n4:5:8:44\\. He may lead her up (to the sacrificial ground) on the first day;\nfor she, the Sahasri, is in reality Va _k_ , and hers, Va _k_ 's, is that\nthousandfold progeny 3.\n\np. 415\n\n[paragraph continues] She walks at the head (of the other 333 cows), and\nbehind her follows her progeny. Or he may lead her up on the last day; then\nher progeny precedes her, and she herself walks behind. This, however, is mere\nspeculation: let him lead her up on the last day,--her progeny precedes her,\nand she herself walks behind.\n\n4:5:8:55\\. North of the Havirdhana shed, and south of the \xc3\x82gnidhra fire-house\nhe makes her smell the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a; for the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a is the\nsacrifice; thus he makes her see the sacrifice.\n\n4:5:8:66\\. With (Va _g_. S. VIII, 42), 'Smell the trough: may the drops enter\nthee, O mighty one!' Now he who gives a thousand (cows) becomes, as it were,\nemptied: him, thus emptied, he thereby replenishes, when he says, 'Smell the\ntrough: may the drops enter thee, O mighty one!'\n\n4:5:8:77\\. 'Return again with sap!' him who is emptied he thus replenishes\nwhen he says, 'Return again with sap!'\n\n4:5:8:88\\. 'And milk to us a thousandfold!' him who is emptied he thus\nreplenishes with a thousand (forces), when he says, 'And milk to us a\nthousandfold!'\n\n4:5:8:99\\. 'Broad-streamed, milk-abounding,--may wealth come back to me!' him\nwho is emptied he thus replenishes when he says, 'May wealth come back to me!'\n\n4:5:8:1010\\. He then mutters in her right ear, 'O I _d_ a, blithesome,\nadorable, lovable, bright, shining, Aditi (inviolable), _S_ arasvati (sapful),\nmighty,\n\np. 416\n\nglorious,--these are thy names, O cow: tell thou the gods of me as a doer of\ngood!'--or, 'speak thou . . .' These indeed are her names with the gods: he\nthus means to say, 'whatever thy names are with the gods, therewith tell the\ngods of me as a doer of good.'\n\n4:5:8:1111\\. They release her. If, not urged by any man, she goes eastwards,\nthen let him know that this sacrificer has succeeded, that he has won the\nhappy world. If she goes northwards, let him know that the sacrificer will be\nmore glorious in this world. If she goes westwards, let him know that he will\nbe rich in dependants and crops. If she goes southwards, let him know that the\nsacrificer will quickly depart from this world. Such are the ways of\nknowledge.\n\n4:5:8:1212\\. And what three (cows) there are each time over and above the\n(three hundred and) thirty, thereto they add that one 1. Now, when they draw\nout a Vira _g_ (verse), they pull it asunder, and a Vira _g_ which is pulled\nasunder is torn in two;--and the Vira _g_ consisting of ten syllables, he thus\nmakes the Vira _g_ complete. Let him give her to the Hot _ri_ ; for the Hot\n_ri_ is a thousandfold 2: therefore let him give her to the Hot _ri_.\n\np. 417\n\n4:5:8:1313\\. Or let him appoint two Unnet _ri_ s, and let him give her to him,\nof the two, who does not call for the _S_ rausha _t_ ; for defective, indeed,\nis he who, being an officiating priest, does not call for the _S_ rausha _t_ ;\nand defective also is the Vira _g_ which is pulled asunder: thus he puts the\ndefective to the defective.\n\n4:5:8:1414\\. Now they say, one ought not to give anything above a thousand\n(cows), because by a thousand he obtains all the objects of his desire. But\n\xc3\x82suri said, 'Let him give according to his wish: by a thousand he indeed\nobtains all his wishes; and anything else (that he gives) is likewise given at\nhis wish 1.'\n\n4:5:8:1515\\. And should he intend to give a cart yoked (with a team of oxen),\nor something else, let him give it either after the offering of the omentum of\nthe barren cow, or at the concluding (udavasaniya) offering.\n\n4:5:8:1616\\. In bringing the dakshi _n_ as, let him bring complete decads. If\nhe intends to give one (cow) to any (priest), let him pass over a decad to ten\nsuch (priests). If he intends to give two to any one, let him pass over a\ndecad to five such (priests). If he intends to give three to any one, let him\npass over a decad to three such 2. If he intends to give five to\n\np. 418\n\nany one, let him pass over a decad to two such. Thus up to a hundred: and thus\nthis perfect Vira _g_ of his becomes a cow of plenty for him in yonder world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[414:1](sbe2667.htm#fr_969) The Sahasradakshi _n_ a Triratra, or sacrifice of\nthree (pressing) days, with a thousand cows as the priests' fee, is mentioned\nKaty. XIII, 4, 35 seq. as, apparently, an independent Ahina sacrifice. I do\nnot, however, know whether it might not be added on to some other sacrificial\nperformance, as, for instance, to the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya sha _d_ aha, thus\nforming together with this the Navaratra (or first nine days of the Da _s_\naratra, see [p. 402](sbe2662.htm#page_402), note [2](sbe2663.htm#fn_935)).\nKaty. gives no indication as to the particular forms of Soma-sacrifice\nrequired for the several days; but, guided no doubt by the Brahma _n_ a, he\nconfines his remarks to the manner of distribution of the dakshi _n_ as.\n\n[414:2](sbe2667.htm#fr_970) Sahasri, lit. 'she who makes the dakshi _n_ a to\nconsist of one thousand.'\n\n[414:3](sbe2667.htm#fr_971) Or,--and from her, Va _k_ , those thousand (cows)\nwere produced; p. 415 or,--and from her (the thousandth cow) that thousandfold\nprogeny of Va _k_ was produced; see [IV, 6, 7, 3](sbe2676.htm#4:6:7:3), where\nthe thousandfold progeny of Va _k_ is identified with the Vedic texts\ngenerally.\n\n[416:1](sbe2667.htm#fr_972) I am not certain whether I understand this passage\nrightly. According to [paragraph 16](sbe2667.htm#4:5:8:16), and Katy. XIII, 4,\n23, he is to give away the cows by tens. This would leave three each day, or\nnine on the three days. To them he is to add the Sahasri, and give the ten\ncows to the Hot _ri_.--A common Vira _g_ verse consists of three times ten\nsyllables; but there are also such as consist of three times eleven syllables.\nThese latter the sacrificer is thus represented (by withholding three cows out\nof thirty-three) to make into a proper Vira _g_.\n\n[416:2](sbe2667.htm#fr_973) That is, according to the St. Petersb. Dict., he\npossesses a p. 417 thousand verses;--if it does not rather refer to the extent\nof the Rig-veda, consisting of rather more than a thousand (1028) hymns. Cp.\nalso 'the thousandfold progeny of Va _k_ ,' p. 414, note 3.\n\n[417:1](sbe2667.htm#fr_974) The Ka _n_ va text has much the same reasoning,\nbut does not ascribe it to any one.\n\n[417:2](sbe2667.htm#fr_975) In this and all other cases the text has 'to those\nthree (ten &c.).' It is not clear in what manner he is to divide the ten cows\nbetween the three priests, unless indeed he is to repeat the same process\nthree times, giving the odd cow each time to another priest. The Ka _n_ va\ntext only mentions two of the cases here given, viz. that if he intends to\ngive one cow to each (ekaikam), p. 418 he is to give ten to ten such; and if\nhe intends to give two to each, he is to give ten to five such. Professor\nWeber, Ind. Stud. X, 52, remarks that this paragraph is not clear to him, and\nsuggests that it may be interpolated. It does not appear, what the exact\nproportion of the thousand cows is for each of the sixteen priests; but we may\nassume that it did not differ much from that given at the Agnish _t_ oma (see\n[p. 345](sbe2653.htm#page_345), note [1](sbe2653.htm#fn_810)), and that this\nresult was brought about by repeated distributions among varied groupings of\nthe priests.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 5, 9.
