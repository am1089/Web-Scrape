It is quite evident that the\ninfinite is not like one object among many, to be definitely classified and\nkept among our possessions, to be used as an ally specially favouring us in\nour politics, warfare, money-making, or in social competitions. We cannot put\nour God in the same list with our summer-houses, motor-cars, or our credit at\nthe bank, as so many people seem to want to do.\n\nWe must try to understand the true character of the desire that a man has when\nhis soul longs for his God. Does it consist of his wish to make an addition,\nhowever valuable, to his belongings? Emphatically no! It is an endlessly\nwearisome task, this continual adding to our stores. In fact, when the soul\nseeks God she seeks her final escape from this incessant gathering and heaping\nand never coming to an end. It is not an additional object the she seeks, but\nit is the _nityo \'nity \xc4\x81n\xc4\x81m_, the permanent in all that is impermanent, the\n_ras \xc4\x81n\xc4\x81m rasatamah_, the highest abiding joy unifying all enjoyments.\nTherefore when the Upanishads teach us to realise everything in Brahma, it is\nnot to seek something extra, not to manufacture something new.\n\n_Know everything that there is in the universe as enveloped by God._  55\n_Enjoy whatever is given by him and harbour not in your mind the greed for\nwealth which is not your own._  56\n\nWhen you know that whatever there is is filled by him and whatever you have is\nhis gift, then you realise the infinite in the finite, and the giver in the\ngifts. Then you know that all the facts of the reality have their only meaning\nin the manifestation of the one truth, and all your possessions have their\nonly significance for you, not in themselves but in the relation they\nestablish with the infinite.\n\nSo it cannot be said that we can find Brahma as we find other objects; there\nis no question of searching from him in one thing in preference to another, in\none place instead of somewhere else. We do not have to run to the grocer\'s\nshop for our morning light; we open our eyes and there it is; so we need only\ngive ourselves up to find that Brahma is everywhere.\n\nThis is the reason why Buddha admonished us to free ourselves from the\nconfinement of the life of the self. If there were nothing else to take its\nplace more positively perfect and satisfying, then such admonition would be\nabsolutely unmeaning. No man can seriously consider the advice, much less have\nany enthusiasm for it, of surrendering everything one has for gaining nothing\nwhatever.\n\nSo our daily worship of God is not really the process of gradual acquisition\nof him, but the daily process of surrendering ourselves, removing all\nobstacles to union and extending our consciousness of him in devotion and\nservice, in goodness and in love.\n\nThe Upanishads say: _Be lost altogether in Brahma like an arrow that has\ncompletely penetrated its target._ Thus to be conscious of being absolutely\nenveloped by Brahma is not an act of mere concentration of mind. It must be\nthe aim of the whole of our life. In all our thoughts and deeds we must be\nconscious of the infinite. Let the realisation of this truth become easier\nevery day of our life, that _none could live or move if the energy of the all-\npervading joy did not fill the sky._  57 In all our actions let us feel that\nimpetus of the infinite energy and be glad.\n\nIt may be said that the infinite is beyond our attainment, so it is for us as\nif it were naught. Yes, if the word attainment implies any idea of possession,\nthen it must be admitted that the infinite is unattainable. But we must keep\nin mind that the highest enjoyment of man is not in the having but in a\ngetting, which is at the same time not getting. Our physical pleasures leave\nno margin for the unrealised. They, like the dead satellite of the earth, have\nbut little atmosphere around them. When we take food and satisfy our hunger it\nis a complete act of possession. So long as the hunger is not satisfied it is\na pleasure to eat. For then our enjoyment of eating touches at every point the\ninfinite. But, when it attains completion, or in other words, when our desire\nfor eating reaches the end of the stage of its non-realisation, it reaches the\nend of its pleasure. In all our intellectual pleasures the margin is broader,\nthe limit is far off. In all our deeper love getting and non-getting run ever\nparallel. In one of our Vaishnava lyrics the lover says to his beloved: "I\nfeel as if I have gazed upon the beauty of thy face from my birth, yet my eyes\nare hungry still: as if I have kept thee pressed to my heart for millions of\nyears, yet my heart is not satisfied."\n\nThis makes it clear that it is really the infinite whom we seek in our\npleasures. Our desire for being wealthy is not a desire for a particular sum\nof money but it is indefinite, and the most fleeting of our enjoyments are but\nthe momentary touches of the eternal. The tragedy of human life consists in\nour vain attempts to stretch the limits of things which can never become\nunlimited,--to reach the infinite by absurdly adding to the rungs of the\nladder of the finite.\n\nIt is evident from this that the real desire of our soul is to get beyond all\nour possessions. Surrounded by things she can touch and feel, she cries, "I am\nweary of getting; ah, where is he who is never to be got?"\n\nWe see everywhere in the history of man that the spirit of renunciation is the\ndeepest reality of the human soul. When the soul says of anything, "I do not\nwant it, for I am above it," she gives utterance to the highest truth that is\nin her. When a girl\'s life outgrows her doll, when she realises that in every\nrespect she is more than her doll is, then she throws it away. By the very act\nof possession we know that we are greater than the things we possess. It is a\nperfect misery to be kept bound up with things lesser than ourselves. This it\nis that Maitrey\xc4\xab felt when her husband gave her his property on the eve of\nleaving home. She asked him, "Would these material things help one to attain\nthe highest?"--or, in other words, "Are they more than my soul to me?" When\nher husband answered, "They will make you rich in worldly possessions," she\nsaid at once, "then what am I to do with these?" It is only when a man truly\nrealises what his possessions are that he has no more illusions about them;\nthen he knows his soul is far above these things and he becomes free from\ntheir bondage. Thus man truly realises his soul by outgrowing his possessions,\nand man\'s progress in the path of eternal life is through a series of\nrenunciations.\n\nThat we cannot absolutely possess the infinite being is not a mere\nintellectual proposition. It has to be experienced, and this experience is\nbliss. The bird, while taking its flight in the sky, experiences at every beat\nof its wings that the sky is boundless, that its wings can never carry it\nbeyond. Therein lies its joy. In the cage the sky is limited; it may be quite\nenough for all the purposes of the bird\'s life, only it is not more than is\nnecessary. The bird cannot rejoice within the limits of the necessary. It must\nfeel that what it has is immeasurably more than it ever can want or\ncomprehend, and then only can it be glad.\n\nThus our soul must soar in the infinite, and she must feel every moment that\nin the sense of not being able to come to the end of her attainment is her\nsupreme joy, her final freedom.\n\nMan\'s abiding happiness is not in getting anything but in giving himself up to\nwhat is greater than himself, to ideas which are larger than his individual\nlife, the idea of his country, of humanity, of God. They make it easier for\nhim to part with all that he has, not expecting his life. His existence is\nmiserable and sordid till he finds some great idea which can truly claim his\nall, which can release him from all attachment to his belongings. Buddha and\nJesus, and all our great prophets, represent such great ideas. They hold\nbefore us opportunities for surrendering our all. When they bring forth their\ndivine alms-bowl we feel we cannot help giving, and we find that in giving is\nour truest joy and liberation, for it is uniting ourselves to that extent with\nthe infinite.\n\nMan is not complete; he is yet to be. In what he _is_ he is small, and if we\ncould conceive him stopping there for eternity we should have an idea of the\nmost awful hell that man can imagine. In his _to be_ he is infinite, there is\nhis heaven, his deliverance. His _is_ is occupied every moment with what it\ncan get and have done with; his _to be_ is hungering for something which is\nmore than can be got, which he never can lose because he never has possessed.\n\nThe finite pole of our existence has its place in the world of necessity.\nThere man goes about searching for food to live, clothing to get warmth. In\nthis region--the region of nature--it is his function to get things. The\nnatural man is occupied with enlarging his possessions.\n\nBut this act of getting is partial. It is limited to man\'s necessities. We can\nhave a thing only to the extent of our requirements, just as a vessel can\ncontain water only to the extent of its emptiness. Our relation to food is\nonly in feeding, our relation to a house is only in habitation. We call it a\nbenefit when a thing is fitted only to some particular want of ours. Thus to\nget is always to get partially, and it never can be otherwise. So this craving\nfor acquisition belongs to our finite self.\n\nBut that side of our existence whose direction is towards the infinite seeks\nnot wealth, but freedom and joy. There the reign of necessity ceases, and\nthere our function is not to get but to be. To be what? To be one with Brahma.\nFor the region of the infinite is the region of unity. Therefore the\nUpanishads say: _If man apprehends God he becomes true._ Here it is becoming,\nit is not having more. Words do no gather bulk when you know their meaning;\nthey become true by being one with the idea.\n\nThough the West has accepted as its teacher him who boldly proclaimed his\noneness with his Father, and who exhorted his followers to be perfect as God,\nit has never been reconciled to this idea of our unity with the infinite\nbeing. It condemns, as a piece of blasphemy, any implication of man\'s becoming\nGod. This is certainly not the idea that Christ preached, nor perhaps the idea\nof the Christian mystics, but this seems to be the idea that has become\npopular in the Christian west.\n\nBut the highest wisdom in the East holds that it is not the function of our\nsoul to _gain_ God, to utilise him for any special material purpose. All that\nwe can ever aspire to is to become more and more one with God. In the region\nof nature, which is the region of diversity, we grow by acquisition; in the\nspiritual world, which is the region of unity, we grow by losing ourselves, by\nuniting. Gaining a thing, as we have said, is by its nature partial, it is\nlimited only to a particular want; but _being_ is complete, it belongs to our\nwholeness, it springs not from any necessity but from our affinity with the\ninfinite, which is the principle of perfection that we have in our soul.\n\nYes, we must become Brahma. We must not shrink to avow this. Our existence is\nmeaningless if we never can expect to realise the highest perfection that\nthere is. If we have an aim and yet can never reach it, then it is no aim at\nall.\n\nBut can it then be said that there is no difference between Brahma and our\nindividual soul? Of course the difference is obvious. Call it illusion or\nignorance, or whatever name you may give it, it is there. You can offer\nexplanations but you cannot explain it away. Even illusion is true an\nillusion.\n\nBrahma is Brahma, he is the infinite ideal of perfection. But we are not what\nwe truly are; we are ever to become true, ever to become Brahma. There is the\neternal play of love in the relation between this being and the becoming; and\nin the depth of this mystery is the source of all truth and beauty that\nsustains the endless march of creation.\n\nIn the music of the rushing stream sounds the joyful assurance, "I shall\nbecome the sea." It is not a vain assumption; it is true humility, for it is\nthe truth. The river has no other alternative. On both sides of its banks it\nhas numerous fields and forests, villages and towns; it can serve them in\nvarious ways, cleanse them and feed them, carry their produce from place to\nplace. But it can have only partial relations with these, and however long it\nmay linger among them it remains separate; it never can become a town or a\nforest.\n\nBut it can and does become the sea. The lesser moving water has its affinity\nwith the great motionless water of the ocean. It moves through the thousand\nobjects on its onward course, and its motion finds its finality when it\nreaches the sea.\n\nThe river can become the sea, but she can never make the sea part and parcel\nof herself. If, by some chance, she has encircled some broad sheet of water\nand pretends that she has made the sea a part of herself, we at once know that\nit is not so, that her current is still seeking rest in the great ocean to\nwhich it can never set boundaries.\n\nIn the same manner, our soul can only become Brahma as the river can become\nthe sea. Everything else she touches at one of her points, then leaves and\nmoves on, but she never can leave Brahma and move beyond him. Once our soul\nrealises her ultimate object of repose in Brahma, all her movements acquire a\npurpose. It is this ocean of infinite rest which gives significance to endless\nactivities. It is this perfectness of being that lends to the imperfection of\nbecoming that quality of beauty which finds its expression in all poetry,\ndrama and art.\n\nThere must be a complete idea that animates a poem. Every sentence of the poem\ntouches that idea. When the reader realises that pervading idea, as he reads\non, then the reading of the poem is full of joy to him. Then every part of the\npoem becomes radiantly significant by the light of the whole. But if the poem\ngoes on interminably, never expressing the idea of the whole, only throwing\noff disconnected images, however beautiful, it becomes wearisome and\nunprofitable in the extreme. The progress of our soul is like a perfect poem.\nIt has an infinite idea which once realised makes all movements full of\nmeaning and joy. But if we detach its movements from that ultimate idea, if we\ndo not see the infinite rest and only see the infinite motion, then existence\nappears to us a monstrous evil, impetuously rushing towards an unending\naimlessness.\n\nI remember in our childhood we had a teacher who used to make us learn by\nheart the whole book of Sanskrit grammer, which is written in symbols, without\nexplaining their meaning to us. Day after day we went toiling on, but on\ntowards what, we had not the least notion. So, as regards our lessons, we were\nin the position of the pessimist who only counts the breathless activities of\nthe world, but cannot see the infinite repose of the perfection whence these\nactivities are gaining their equilibrium every moment in absolute fitness and\nharmony. We lose all joy in thus contemplating existence, because we miss the\ntruth. We see the gesticulations of the dancer, and we imagine these are\ndirected by a ruthless tyranny of chance, while we are deaf to the eternal\nmusic which makes every one of these gestures inevitably spontaneous and\nbeautiful. These motions are ever growing into that music of perfection,\nbecoming one with it, dedicating to that melody at every step the\nmultitudinous forms they go on creating.\n\nAnd this is the truth of our soul, and this is her joy, that she must ever be\ngrowing into Brahma, that all her movements should be modulated by this\nultimate idea, and all her creations should be given as offerings to the\nsupreme spirit of perfection.\n\nThere is a remarkable saying in the Upanishads: _I think not that I know him\nwell, or that I know him, or even that I know him not._  58\n\nBy the process of knowledge we can never know the infinite being. But if he is\naltogether beyond our reach, then he is absolutely nothing to us. The truth is\nthat we know him not, yet we know him.\n\nThis has been explained in another saying of the Upanishads: _From Brahma\nwords come back baffled, as well as the mind, but he who knows him by the joy\nof him is free from all fears._  59\n\nKnowledge is partial, because our intellect is an instrument, it is only a\npart of us, it can give us information about things which can be divided and\nanalysed, and whose properties can be classified part by part. But Brahma is\nperfect, and knowledge which is partial can never be a knowledge of him.\n\nBut he can be known by joy, by love. For joy is knowledge in its completeness,\nit is knowing by our whole being. Intellect sets us apart from the things to\nbe known, but love knows its object by fusion. Such knowledge is immediate and\nadmits no doubt. It is the same as knowing our own selves, only more so.\n\nTherefore, as the Upanishads say, mind can never know Brahma, words can never\ndescribe him; he can only be known by our soul, by her joy in him, by her\nlove. Or, in other words, we can only come into relation with him by union--\nunion of our whole being. We must be one with our Father, we must be perfect\nas he is.\n\nBut how can that be? There can be no grade in infinite perfection. We cannot\ngrow more and more into Brahma. He is the absolute one, and there can be no\nmore or less in him.\n\nIndeed, the realisation of the _param \xc4\x81tman_, the supreme soul, within our\n_antar \xc4\x81tman_, our inner individual soul, is in a state of absolute\ncompletion. We cannot think of it as non- existent and depending on our\nlimited powers for its gradual construction. If our relation with the divine\nwere all a thing of our own making, how should we rely on it as true, and how\nshould it lend us support?\n\nYes, we must know that within us we have that where space and time cease to\nrule and where the links of evolution are merged in unity. In that everlasting\nabode of the _\xc4\x81 taman_, the soul, the revelation of the _param \xc4\x81tman_, the\nsupreme soul, is already complete. Therefore the Upanishads say: _He who knows\nBrahman, the true, the all-conscious, and the infinite as hidden in the depths\nof the soul, which is the supreme sky (the inner sky of consciousness), enjoys\nall objects of desire in union with the all-knowing Brahman._  60\n\nThe union is already accomplished. The _param \xc4\x81tman_, the supreme soul, has\nhimself chosen this soul of ours as his bride and the marriage has been\ncompleted. The solemn _mantram_ has been uttered: _Let thy heart be even as my\nheart is._  61 There is no room in this marriage for evolution to act the part\nof the master of ceremonies. The _eshah_ , who cannot otherwise be described\nthan as _This_ , the nameless immediate presence, is ever here in our\ninnermost being. "This _eshah_ , or _This_ , is the supreme end of the other\nthis";  62 "this _This_ is the supreme treasure of the other this";  63 "this\n_This_ is the supreme dwelling of the other this";  64 "this _This_ is the\nsupreme joy of the other this."  65 Because the marriage of supreme love has\nbeen accomplished in timeless time. And now goes on the endless _l \xc4\xabl\xc4\x81_, the\nplay of love. He who has been gained in eternity is now being pursued in time\nand space, in joys and sorrows, in this world and in the worlds beyond. When\nthe soul-bride understands this well, her heart is blissful and at rest. She\nknows that she, like a river, has attained the ocean of her fulfilment at one\nend of her being, and at the other end she is ever attaining it; at one end it\nis eternal rest and completion, at the other it is incessant movement and\nchange. When she knows both ends as inseparably connected, then she knows the\nworld as her own household by the right of knowing the master of the world as\nher own lord. Then all her services becomes services of love, all the troubles\nand tribulations of life come to her as trials triumphantly borne to prove the\nstrength of her love, smilingly to win the wager from her lover. But so long\nas she remains obstinately in the dark, lifts not her veil, does not recognise\nher lover, and only knows the world dissociated from him, she serves as a\nhandmaid here, where by right she might reign as a queen; she sways in doubt,\nand weeps in sorrow and dejection. _She passes from starvation to starvation,\nfrom trouble to trouble, and from fear to fear._  66\n\nI can never forget that scrap of a song I once heard in the early dawn in the\nmidst of the din of the crowd that had collected for a festival the night\nbefore: "Ferryman, take me across to the other shore!"\n\nIn the bustle of all our work there comes out this cry, "Take me across." The\ncarter in India sings while driving his cart, "Take me across." The itinerant\ngrocer deals out his goods to his customers and sings, "Take me across".\n\nWhat is the meaning of this cry? We feel we have not reached our goal; and we\nknow with all our striving and toiling we do not come to the end, we do not\nattain our object. Like a child dissatisfied with its dolls, our heart cries,\n"Not this, not this." But what is that other? Where is the further shore?\n\nIs it something else than what we have? Is it somewhere else than where we\nare? Is it to take rest from all our works, to be relieved from all the\nresponsibilities of life?\n\nNo, in the very heart of our activities we are seeking for our end. We are\ncrying for the across, even where we stand. So, while our lips utter their\nprayer to be carried away, our busy hands are never idle.\n\nIn truth, thou ocean of joy, this shore and the other shore are one and the\nsame in thee. When I call this my own, the other lies estranged; and missing\nthe sense of that completeness which is in me, my heart incessantly cries out\nfor the other. All my this, and that other, are waiting to be completely\nreconciled in thy love.\n\nThis "I" of mine toils hard, day and night, for a home which it knows as its\nown. Alas, there will be no end of its sufferings so long as it is not able to\ncall this home thine. Till then it will struggle on, and its heart will ever\ncry, "Ferryman, lead me across." When this home of mine is made thine, that\nvery moment is it taken across, even while its old walls enclose it. This "I"\nis restless. It is working for a gain which can never be assimilated with its\nspirit, which it never can hold and retain. In its efforts to clasp in its own\narms that which is for all, it hurts others and is hurt in its turn, and\ncries, "Lead me across". But as soon as it is able to say, "All my work is\nthine," everything remains the same, only it is taken across.\n\nWhere can I meet thee unless in this mine home made thine? Where can I join\nthee unless in this my work transformed into thy work? If I leave my home I\nshall not reach thy home; if I cease my work I can never join thee in thy\nwork. For thou dwellest in me and I in thee. Thou without me or I without thee\nare nothing.\n\nTherefore, in the midst of our home and our work, the prayer rises, "Lead me\nacross!" For here rolls the sea, and even here lies the other shore waiting to\nbe reached--yes, here is this everlasting present, not distant, not anywhere\nelse.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[55](sadh10.htm#fr_54) \xc4\xaa\xc3\xa7h\xc4\x81v\xc4\x81syamdiam sarvam yat kincha jagaty\xc4\x81njagat.\n\n[56](sadh10.htm#fr_55) T\xc4\x93na tyakt\xc4\x93na bhunj\xc4\xab\xc5\xa3h\xc4\x81 m\xc4\x81 g\xc5\x97idhah kasyasviddhanam.\n\n[57](sadh10.htm#fr_56) Ko hyev\xc4\x81ny\xc4\x81t kah pr\xc4\x81ny\xc4\x81t yadesha \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc3\xa7ha \xc4\x81nando na sy\xc4\x81t.\n\n[58](sadh10.htm#fr_57) N\xc4\x81ham manye suvedeti no na vedeti vedacha.\n\n[59](sadh10.htm#fr_58) Yato v\xc4\x81cho nivartante apr\xc4\x81pya manas\xc4\x81 saha \xc4\x81nandam\nbrahma\xc5\x86o vidv\xc4\x81n na vibheti kuta\xc3\xa7chana.\n\n[60](sadh10.htm#fr_59) Satyam j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81nam anantam brahma yo veda nihitam guh\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81m\nparamo vyoman so\'\xc3\xa7nute sarv\xc4\x81n k\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81n saha brahma\xc5\x86a vipas\xc3\xa7hite.\n\n[61](sadh10.htm#fr_60) Yadetat h\xc5\x97idayam mama tadastu h\xc5\x97idayan tava.\n\n[62](sadh10.htm#fr_61) Esh\xc4\x81sya param\xc4\x81 gatih\n\n[63](sadh10.htm#fr_62) Esh\xc4\x81sya param\xc4\x81 sampat.\n\n[64](sadh10.htm#fr_63) Esh\xc4\x81sya paramo lokah\n\n[65](sadh10.htm#fr_64) Esh\xc4\x81sya parama \xc4\x81nandah\n\n[66](sadh10.htm#fr_65) Daurbhiksh\xc4\x81t y\xc4\x81ti daurbhiksham kle\xc3\xa7\xc4\x81t kle\xc3\xa7am bhay\xc4\x81t\nbhayam.\n\n'
