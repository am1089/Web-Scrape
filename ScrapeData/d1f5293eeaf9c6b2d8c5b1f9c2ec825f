FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n6:1:1:11\\. Verily, in the beginning there was here the non-existent 1. As to\nthis they say, 'What was that non-existent?' The _Ri_ shis, assuredly,--it is\nthey that were the non-existent 2. As to this they say, 'Who were those _Ri_\nshis?' The _Ri_ shis, doubtless, were the vital airs: inasmuch as before (the\nexistence of) this universe, they, desiring it, wore themselves out (rish)\nwith toil and austerity, therefore (they are called) _Ri_ shis.\n\n6:1:1:22\\. This same vital air in the midst doubtless is Indra. He, by his\npower (indriya), kindled those (other) vital airs from the midst; and inasmuch\nas he kindled (indh), he is the kindler (indha): the kindler 3 indeed,--him\nthey call 'Indra' mystically\n\np. 144\n\n[paragraph continues] (esoterically), for the gods love the mystic. They (the\nvital airs), being kindled, created seven separate persons 1 (purusha).\n\n6:1:1:33\\. They said, 'Surely, being thus, we shall not be able to generate:\nlet us make these seven persons one Person!' They made those seven persons one\nPerson: they compressed two of them 2 (into) what is above the navel, and two\nof them (into) what is below the navel; (one) person was (one) wing (or side),\n(one) person was (the other) wing, and one person was the base (i.e. the\nfeet).\n\n6:1:1:44\\. And what excellence, what life-sap (rasa) there was in those seven\npersons, that they concentrated above, that became his head. And because (in\nit) they concentrated the excellence ( _s_ ri), therefore it is (called) the\nhead ( _s_ iras). It was thereto that the breaths resorted ( _s_ ri):\ntherefore also it is the head ( _s_ iras). And because the breaths did so\nresort ( _s_ ri) thereto, therefore also the breaths (vital airs, and their\norgans) are elements of excellence ( _s_ ri). And because they resorted to the\nwhole (system) therefore (this is called) body ( _s_ arira).\n\n6:1:1:55\\. That same Person became Pra _g_ apati (lord of generation). And\nthat Person which became Pra _g_ apati is this very Agni (fire-altar), who is\nnow (to be) built.\n\n6:1:1:66\\. He verily is composed of seven persons, for this Person (Agni) is\ncomposed of seven persons 3,\n\np. 145\n\nto wit, the body (trunk) of four, and the wings and tail of three; for the\nbody of that (first) Person (was composed of) four, and the wings and tail of\nthree. And inasmuch as he makes the body larger by one person, by that force\nthe body raises the wings and tail.\n\n6:1:1:77\\. And as to the fire which is deposited on the built (altar),--\nwhatever excellence, whatever life-sap there was in those seven persons, that\nthey now concentrate above, that is his (Pra _g_ apati's) head. On that same\n(head) all the gods are dependent ( _s_ rita), for it is there that offering\nis made to all the gods: therefore also it is the head ( _s_ iras).\n\n6:1:1:88\\. Now this Person Pra _g_ apati desired, 'May I be more (than one),\nmay I be reproduced!' He toiled, he practised austerity. Being worn out with\ntoil and austerity, he created first of all the Brahman (neut.), the triple\nscience. It became to him a foundation: hence they say, 'the Brahman (Veda) is\nthe foundation of everything here.' Wherefore, having studied (the Veda) one\nrests on a foundation; for this, to wit, the Veda, is his foundation. Resting\non that foundation, he (again) practised austerity.\n\n6:1:1:99\\. He created the waters out of Va _k_ (speech, that is) the world;\nfor speech belonged to it 1: that was\n\np. 146\n\ncreated (set free). It pervaded everything here; and because it pervaded (ap)\nwhatsoever there was here, therefore (it is called) water (apa _h_ ); and\nbecause it covered (var), therefore also it (is called) water (var).\n\n6:1:1:1010\\. He desired, 'May I be reproduced from these waters!' He entered\nthe waters with that triple science. Thence an egg arose. He touched it. 'Let\nit exist! let it exist and multiply!' so he said. From it the Brahman (neut.)\nwas first created, the triple science. Hence they say, 'The Brahman (n.) is\nthe first-born of this All.' For even before that Person the Brahman was\ncreated 1: it was created as his mouth. Hence they say of him who has studied\nthe Veda, that 'he is like Agni;' for it, the Brahman (Veda), is Agni's mouth.\n\n6:1:1:1111\\. Now the embryo which was inside was created as the foremost\n(agri): inasmuch as it was created foremost (agram) of this All, therefore (it\nis called) Agri: Agri, indeed, is he whom they mystically call 2 Agni; for the\ngods love the mystic. And the tear (a _s_ ru, n.) which had formed itself 3\n[became](errata.htm#12) the 'a _s_ ru' (m.): 'a _s_ ru' indeed is what they\nmystically call 'a _s_ va' (horse), for the gods love the\n\np. 147\n\nmystic. And that which, as it were, cried 1 (ras), became the ass (rasabha).\nAnd the juice which was adhering to the shell (of the egg) became the he-goat\n(a _g_ a 2). And that which was the shell became the earth.\n\n6:1:1:1212\\. He desired, 'May I generate, this (earth) from these waters!' He\ncompressed it 3 and threw it into the water. The juice which flowed from it\nbecame a tortoise; and that which was spirted upwards (became) what is\nproduced above here over the wafers. This whole (earth) dissolved itself all\nover the water: all this (universe) appeared as one form only, namely, water.\n\n6:1:1:1313\\. He desired, 'May it become more than one, may it reproduce\nitself!' He toiled and practised austerity; and worn out with toil and\nausterity, he created foam. He was aware that 'this indeed looks different, it\nis becoming more (than one): I must toil, indeed!' Worn out with toil and\nausterity, he created clay, mud, saline soil and sand, gravel (pebble), rock,\nore, gold, plants and trees: therewith he clothed this earth.\n\n6:1:1:1414\\. This (earth), then, was created as (consisting of) these same\nnine creations. Hence they say, 'Threefold (three times three) is Agni;' for\nAgni is this (earth), since thereof the whole Agni (fire-altar) is\nconstructed.\n\n6:1:1:1515\\. 'This (earth) has indeed become (bhu) a foundation!' (he\nthought): hence it became the earth (bhumi). He spread it out (prath), and it\n\np. 148\n\nbecame the broad one (or earth, p _ri_ thivi). And she (the earth), thinking\nherself quite perfect 1, sang; and inasmuch as she sang (ga), therefore she is\nGayatri. But they also say, 'It was Agni, indeed, on her (the earth's) back,\nwho thinking himself quite perfect, sang; and inasmuch as he sang (ga),\ntherefore Agni is Gayatra.' And hence whosoever thinks himself quite perfect,\neither sings or delights in song 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[143:1](sbe4128.htm#fr_282) Or, perhaps, In the beginning this (universe) was\nindeed nonexistent. Thus J. Muir, Or. S. T. IV, p. 22, of which translation of\nthis cosmogonic myth considerable use has been made here. It need scarcely be\nremarked that 'idam' is constantly used in an adverbial sense in the Brahma\n_n_ a.\n\n[143:2](sbe4128.htm#fr_283) In the original, 'the non-existent' is the subject\nof the clause, not the predicate as would appear from the translation. A\nsimilar transposition seems often advisable in English, for the sake of\nemphasis, and on other grounds. Muir's rendering, 'The Rishis say that in the\nbeginning there was non-existence,' is a mistake.\n\n[143:3](sbe4128.htm#fr_284) The nominative here is striking, and vivid, cf.\n[paragraph 11](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:11) below. In corresponding passages of the\npreceding books, the accusative would stand here; e _g_. II, 1, 2, 4,\nsaptarshin u ha sma vai purarksha ity a _k_ akshate; similarly III, 1, 2, 3.\n\n[144:1](sbe4128.htm#fr_285) That is, living beings or souls, individualities,\nwhich, in their combined form, are here imagined to take the shape of a bird.\nMuir's rendering, 'males,' can scarcely commend itself.\n\n[144:2](sbe4128.htm#fr_286) Literally, 'those two.'\n\n[144:3](sbe4128.htm#fr_287) The fire-altar is usually constructed so as to\nmeasure seven p. 145 man's lengths square; the particular length being that of\nthe Sacrificer. This, however, is the smallest size allowed for an altar,\nthere being altogether ninety-five different sizes specified, varying between\nseven and 101 man's lengths square.\n\n[145:1](sbe4128.htm#fr_288) Or, perhaps, to him (Pra _g_ apati). Saya _n_ a\nmerely says,--vag evasya sas _ri_ _g_ yata, vak sahakari rasanam abhavat, tad\nas _ri_ _g_ yatety artha _h_ ; sa vak sahakari rasanam pra _g_ apatya( _m_ ) s\n_ri_ sh _t_ a _m_ sad ida _m_ sarvam apnot.--On the part which Va _k_ (the\npersonification of the Brahman or Veda) takes by the side of Pra _g_ apati in\nthe creation p. 146 of the universe, and the parallelism between Va _k_ and\n\xce\xbb\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xcf\x83, see Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 473 seq.; Muir, Or. S. T. V, p. 391. Thus\nPa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_. Br. XX, 14, 2, 'Pra _g_ apati alone existed here. He had Va _k_\nindeed as his own, as a second to him.'\n\n[146:1](sbe4128.htm#fr_289) Muir takes this differently,--Further, (as) the\nVeda was first created from that Male, therefore it was created his mouth.\nThis translation, however, takes no account of the particle 'hi.'\n\n[146:2](sbe4128.htm#fr_290) For the construction, see above, [paragraph\n2](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:2), with note *3*.\n\n[146:3](sbe4128.htm#fr_291) Literally, which had flowed together. It is\nexplained as the embryonic liquid in the amnion, or innermost membrane\nenveloping the foetus.\n\n[147:1](sbe4128.htm#fr_292) ? Or, that part (of the egg) which made a noise\n(in cracking).\n\n[147:2](sbe4128.htm#fr_293) The word 'a _g_ a' is apparently fancifully taken\nhere in the sense of 'unborn (a- _g_ a).'\n\n[147:3](sbe4128.htm#fr_294) That is, the earth when as yet in the form of the\negg-shell.\n\n[148:1](sbe4128.htm#fr_295) Abhimaninistrivigraha yasmad agayad tasmad iya _m_\nGayatri, Say.--'Because, like a haughty woman, she (the earth) sang, therefore\nshe is Gayatri.'\n\n[148:2](sbe4128.htm#fr_296) On this illustration, which might either be taken\nas applying to men in easy circumstances, not troubled with cares;--or,\nperhaps, to a new-born child which cries out lustily, and likes to be sung to,\n--Saya _n_ a only remarks,--tasmad u haitad iti svabhavanuvada _h_ ,\nkaryadharme _n_ a kara _n_ adharmanupadanaya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 1, 2.
