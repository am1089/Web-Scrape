And on account of the equality of names and forms there is no\ncontradiction, even in the renovation (of the world); as appears from--Sruti\nand Sm _ri_ ti.\n\nOn account of the sameness of names and forms, as stated before, there is no\ndifficulty in the way of the origination of the world, even in the case of\ntotal pralayas. For what actually takes place is as follows. When the period\nof a great pralaya draws towards its close, the divine supreme Person,\nremembering the constitution of the world previous to the pralaya, and forming\nthe volition \'May I become manifold\' separates into its constituent\n\np. 334\n\nelements the whole mass of enjoying souls and objects of enjoyment which,\nduring the pralaya state, had been merged in him so as to possess a separate\nexistence (not actual but) potential only, and then emits the entire world\njust as it had been before, from the so-called Mahat down to the Brahman-egg,\nand Hira _n_ yagarbha (Pra _g_ apati). Having thereupon manifested the Vedas\nin exactly the same order and arrangement they had had before, and having\ntaught them to Hira _n_ yagarbha, he entrusts to him the new creation of the\ndifferent classes of beings, gods, and so on, just as it was before; and at\nthe same time abides himself within the world so created as its inner Self and\nRuler. This view of the process removes all difficulties. The superhuman\norigin and the eternity of the Veda really mean that intelligent agents having\nreceived in their minds an impression due to previous recitations of the Veda\nin a fixed order of words, chapters, and so on, remember and again recite it\nin that very same order of succession. This holds good both with regard to us\nmen and to the highest Lord of all; there however is that difference between\nthe two cases that the representations of the Veda which the supreme Person\nforms in his own mind are spontaneous, not dependent on an impression\npreviously made.\n\nTo the question whence all this is known, the Sutra replies \'from Scripture\nand Sm _ri_ ti.\' The scriptural passage is \'He who first creates Brahma and\ndelivers the Vedas to him\' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 18). And as to Sm _ri_ ti we\nhave the following statement in Manu, \'This universe existed in the shape of\ndarkness, &c.--He desiring to produce beings of many kinds from his own body,\nfirst with a thought created the waters and placed his seed in them. That seed\nbecame a golden egg equal to the sun in brilliancy; in that he himself was\nborn as Brahma, the progenitor of the whole world\' (Manu I, 5; 8-9). To the\nsame effect are the texts of the Paura _n_ ikas, \'From the navel of the\nsleeping divinity there sprung up a lotus, and in that lotus there was born\nBrahma fully knowing all Vedas and Vedangas. And then Brahma was told by him\n(the highest Divinity),\n\np. 335\n\n\'Do thou create all beings, O Great-minded one\'; and the following passage,\n\'From the highest Naraya _n_ a there was born the Four-faced one.\'--And in the\nsection which begins \'I will tell the original creation,\' we read \'Because\nhaving created water (nara) I abide within it, therefore my name shall be\nNaraya _n_ a. There I lie asleep in every Kalpa, and as I am sleeping there\nsprings from my navel a lotus, and in that lotus there is born the Four-faced\none, and I tell him "Do thou, Great-minded one, create all beings."\'--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of \'the deities.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 30.
