I have no taste for food, I have no sleep; my\nheart is ever restless within doors and without.  \nAs water is to the thirsty, so is the lover to the bride. Who is there that\nwill carry my news to my Beloved?  \nKabir is restless: he is dying for sight of Him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXXVI](sok037.htm)\n\n'
