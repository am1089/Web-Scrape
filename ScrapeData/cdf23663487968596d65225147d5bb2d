The disciples of Auguste Comte have done much\nto popularise certain important words and conceptions, but the hearts of\nangels and the tongues of poets would be too little to meet all the\nnecessities of the task.\n\nThe word _theocracy_ , for instance, which is essential to an understanding of\nAsia, either territorial or historic, has but an ambiguous sound in English.\nTo the learned Positivist it means "the social system built up on theism"; to\nthe vulgar, it indicates some fabulous scheme of divine monarchy, such as is\npopularly attributed to Israel before the days of Saul, or to England in the\ndreams of Oliver Cromwell.\n\nTo persons thinking in the latter fashion, the two statements that India is a\ntheocracy, and that it is at present occupied by the British raj, seem\nincompatible. It is clear that only detailed and penetrative knowledge of\nconcrete examples can build up in our minds such a conception of the\nessentials of a theocratic system as shall give us the power of handling the\nterm as confidently and\n\np. 254\n\nintelligently as we now feel capable of using more purely political\nexpressions. And of such examples it will be found best to take the nearest\nfirst.\n\nIn the history of the world, the city of Rome occupies a unique position, as\nthe Occidental cradle and battle-field of two opposing forces, the Imperial\nand the Theocratic, or, as one may prefer to call them, the European and the\nAsiatic ideas. For it was Rome that first imposed upon the West that notion of\norganised force which is almost all that is at present meant by the state-\nempire. And through all the feuds and disorders of the Middle Ages, it was the\nRoman impulse that was working itself out by the energy of barbarian peoples,\nto its perfect triumph in the nineteenth century. Caesar conceived, Napoleon\ncompleted, the imperial scheme. Alexander as an individual may have seen what\nthey saw: but Greece was far too near to Asia, and his military designs could\nbut evaporate before their time into mere learned observations and the\nexchange of interesting thought.\n\nIt was left to Rome to elaborate into fixity of precision that destiny which\ncould not perhaps have been avoided by the peoples of a coast-line, kept\nmilitant by the daily conquest of Nature, tempted to aggression by the very\nhabits of their life. For empire in the European sense is a very different\nthing from the marauding hosts of the East going nut to warfare headed by a\ncommander of brilliant prowess. Rome instituted, and modern Europe has\ninherited, the idea of one _people_ exploiting another, under rights strictly\ndefined by law, with an appearance of order which would deceive the very\nelect.\n\nThe Caesars failed by the strength of the unassimilable elements which their\nEmpire had to meet. Napoleon failed because those whom he temporarily subdued\nwere as strong to re-act in\n\np. 255\n\nimitation as to be assimilated. To-day the Roman Empire is represented by some\neight or ten emulous peoples and princes, all armed to the teeth, all bent on\nappropriating the world. But it is the Roman Empire still.\n\nAnd yet Rome herself is the one character whose part in the drama is\ncompletely transformed. For no one yet thinks of her as the metropolis of the\njuvenile kingdom of Italy. To the imagination of humanity she is still the\ncity of the Church. St. Peter\'s and the Vatican still form her central point.\nThe Pope still rules. This contrast between her first and second selves is\nmuch more startling than the transition by which the brigand-chief becomes the\nsainted ancestor. Before it happened, it would have seemed far more absurd\nthan it would be to-day to propose to make the name of Oxford or Benares a\nsynonym for the vulgar competition of trade. For Rome, the supreme, the\ninvincible, has actually been conquered by the ideas of the East. The poor and\nthe lowly have taken her by storm. Henceforth is she to be in Europe not the\nvoice of domination, but of renunciation; not the teacher of aggression, but\nof self-sacrifice; royal in her rank and her prerogatives certainly, but far\nmore deeply and truly the friend of the people than of kings. Henceforth,\nthose who are in a special sense her children will live sequestered from the\nworld, pursuing after poverty instead of riches, after self-mortification\ninstead of self-indulgence; men and women apart, as in the Eastern household.\nEvery simple act that she enjoins will possess a sanctity out of all\nproportion to its intrinsic value. Her customs will become rituals. Her\njourneys will be pilgrimages. The simplest ordinances of life, administered by\nher, will now be sacraments. The expression of her forgiveness will be\nabsolution; of her affection, a benediction. Her very rulers will claim no\npersonal\n\np. 256\n\nright to their high places, but will declare themselves simple executors of\nthe divine will. "Servant of the servants of God" will be, to the thinking of\nthe world, their proudest title.\n\nIn the eyes of the Church, henceforth, all men are to be equal, at least until\none has made himself a saint, and another Judas. The differences of rank\nestablished by the world are to be as nothing before her, and even\necclesiastical gradations are to be merely as conditions on which grace can\nwork. Many of the saints will be humble and unlearned. Many a bishop will\nreach the lowest hell. Rank, at least theoretically, is nothing to Rome. Her\nchildren are all to be the sharers of a common supernatural life, of which a\nreligious banquet is the token. A great responsibility is to rest upon them,\nof living worthily of the name by which they are called. Their life, as\nrelated to each other and to her, can be expressed only in terms of the\nexploration and manifestation of certain ideals, laid down broadly in\nauthoritative writings, known as _Scriptures_ , and with less clearness and\npower in secondary writings and teachings, called _traditions_.\n\nIn other words, the Imperial city has transformed herself into a pure\ntheocracy. If we blot out the idea of birth by a sacramental rite, and\nsubstitute that of a chosen place and race, keeping everything else\napproximately the same, the Church is re-transmuted into any one out of half a\ndozen Eastern countries--ancient Egypt, Judaea, Arabia, modern India--under\nthe government of the religious idea. Here, too, the priesthood dominates all\nclasses equally, and the priestly interpretation of life prevails--the very\ngifts one brings home from a journey are explained as temple-offerings. Here,\ntoo, the political system is extraneous: custom is sacred, so that a grammar\nof habit takes the place of legislation;\n\np. 257\n\nmen and women live apart; merit is the sole real condition of social prestige;\nand so on.\n\nIt is due to the purely natural character of the great complexus, that we have\nin India the--to us so extraordinary--spectacle of a society handed over to\nthe power of a priesthood, without in any way losing its sense of the\nuniversal sacredness of learning and freedom of thought. In the case of Rome,\nwhere an artificial system was created on the basis of a foreign experience,\nthe crude temper of the old imperialism betrayed itself primarily against mind\nand thought, which it conceived as the legitimate sphere of its authority. In\nCatholic Europe, a man might scarcely venture to believe that the earth moves;\nmust apologise for enjoying the cosmic speculations of La Place; could hardly\nstudy Plato without grave suspicion. In India, atheism itself might be\npreached on the very steps of the temple. All that the people would demand of\nthe preacher would be sincerity. * In Christendom, knowledge has been so much\nfeared that men have again and again suffered torture and death for no other\ncrime. In India, knowledge has always been held to be beatitude. Abundance of\nwords, in every Indian language, testify to the honour paid to scholars.\nPersian and English books are held as sacred as the Sanskrit. And we should\nseek in vain, throughout history and language, for any trace of limitation\nimposed, or suggested to be imposed, upon the mind of man.\n\nEven the vexed question of the right of literature to reveal more than is\npermitted to conversation, was\n\np. 258\n\nforeseen long ago and settled in a flash of wit by the legislator who, writing\nof defilement by the touch of the mouth, makes three exceptions, in favour of\n"the beaks of birds, the lips of women, and _the words of poets_."\n\nIn fact opinion is so free that religious propaganda is actually discouraged\nby Hinduism, lest zeal, outrunning discretion, prove mischievous to society.\n"A man has a right to hold his own belief, but never to force it upon\nanother," is the dictum that has made of India a perfect university of\nreligious culture, including every phase and stage of thought and practice,\nfrom that of the kindergarten, where all is concrete, to that of the higher\nresearch student, who has direct visualisation of the solutions of problems\nwhich most of us cannot even understand.\n\nBut freedom of thought in the East has not been the prerogative of religion\nalone. The deeper we go into the history of Hindu philosophy, the more\nperplexed we are that with its obviously scientific character it should never\nhave created a scientific movement of the prestige and _e clat_ of that of the\nWest. Patanjali, * who wrote his great psychology in the second century B.C.,\nwas obviously a physiologist, studying the living body in relation to that\nnervous system which in its entirety he would call the mind. The action and\ninter-action of the living neuropsychosis is a question which modern science,\ncontent with a more static view of human structure, has hardly yet ventured to\ntackle, and students of Patanjali cannot be controverted if they hold that\nwhen it is reached, it will only be to corroborate the ancient investigations\nstep by step. But a still more interesting feature of Patanjali\'s work lies in\nthe fact that\n\np. 259\n\nit is obviously the final record of a long research, carried out, not by a\nsingle individual, but by a whole school, experimenting continuously through\nmany generations. Each man\'s labour was conditioned by the fact that he had no\nlaboratory and no instruments outside his own body, and there can be no doubt\nthat life was often sacrificed to the thirst for knowledge. The whole,\ntherefore, is like a _r esume_ of two or three centuries of the conclusions of\nsome English Royal Society, or some French Academy of Sciences, dating from\ntwo to three thousand years ago. And we must remember that, if the terminology\nof this old science has a certain quaintness in our ears, this is probably not\ngreater than that which our own talk of forces and molecules, of chemical\naffinities and sphygmographic records, would have, if it were suddenly\nrecovered, after a lapse of two thousand years, by a new civilisation,\nstationed, say, in Mexico.\n\nWhat is true of the psychology is equally true of Indian mathematics,\nastronomy, surgery, chemistry. The Oriental predilection for meditative\ninsight is an advantage in the field of mathematics, where deduction is a\nnecessity. But at the same time its fundamental solidity and originality are\nshown by the fact that highly abstruse problems are stated by Hindu thinkers\nin concrete, and even in poetic terms. And it will be remembered that less\nthan a hundred years ago, De Morgan * celebrated the solution at sight of\ncertain hitherto uncompleted problems of "Maxima and Minima," by a young Hindu\ncalled Ram Chandra.\n\nThe law of gravitation itself was enunciated and discussed by Bhashkar Acharya\nin the twelfth century. And the antiquity of the Sanskrit word\n\np. 260\n\n_shunyo_ , for _nought_ , together with the immemorial distribution of the\nsystem all over the country, conclusively proves that our decimal notation is\nIndian, and not Arabic, in origin.\n\nHow is it, then, we repeat, that a more imposing scientific activity has not\nbeen the result of a faculty so undeniable? Many considerations may be adduced\nin explanation. There is a vast international organisation of scientific\neffort in Europe to-day, operating to make an incomparable sum of results.\nAncient India knew what was meant by scientific co-operation, but by\norganisation scarcely. And no one nation, working alone, could have produced\nthe whole of what we know as Modern Science, or even one division of it.\nAncient Greece gives us the first word on electricity. What a leap from this\nto Volta and Galvani! Where, again, had these been without the German Hertz,\nthe French Ampere, the Hindu Bose? And then Italy for a second time takes up\nthe thread of inquiry, and produces the apparatus for wireless telegraphy.\n\nAgain, we must remember that in Europe to-day we have renounced almost\neverything for science. Art and letters are almost at a standstill. In these\ndepartments--at least, in every country outside France and Russia--we are\nliving almost entirely on the treasures of the past. In religion we see the\nsame superficial eclecticism, the same absence of genuine contemporary\nimpulse. But India never was in this position. Side by side with the learned\nman, speculating or experimenting on the secrets of Nature, the builders were\nraising the village temple, the shuttle flew to and fro in the loom, the clink\nof the tools was heard in the brass-smithy, the palace pundits busied\nthemselves with their collection of ancient texts, the saints poured forth the\nrapture of their souls, the peasant waked and slept in the good\n\np. 261\n\ncompany of Nature, rice-field and palm-tree, cattle and farmstead. Faith, art,\nand industry lived on undisturbed.\n\nAfter all, is it not possible that we deceive ourselves? The true secret of\nour elimination of every other intellectual activity in favour of science, is\nit really the depth of our enthusiasm for knowledge, or is it not rather our\nmodern fever for its mechanical application? How far is the passion for pure\ntruth unimpaired by commercial interests? How far is our substitution of\nspecialisms for synthesis conditioned by finance merely? When our utilitarian\ningenuity draws nearer exhaustion, when the present spasm of inventive ability\nhas worked itself out, then, and not till then, will come the time for\nestimating the actual profundity and disinterestedness of our scientific\nardour. Will our love of knowledge continue to drive us on to a still deeper\ntheoretic insight, or will our investigations languish in our hands, lingering\non as a mere fashion in learning, even as Aristotle lingered on through the\nMiddle Ages? Till such questions are nearer finding their answer we are in no\nposition to assume that the present period is, or is not, ultimately\nscientific.\n\nMeanwhile, in India this danger of a mercenary science was always foreseen,\nand viewed with perhaps an exaggerated horror, so that from the beginning the\ndisciple has been required to seek knowledge for its own sake, renouncing all\nulterior motive. The value derived at the present stage of development from\nincorporating a progressive science in a progressive civilisation was thus\nlost; although we must remember that in a very real sense such a transition,\nshorn of its lower elements, has occurred in the East from prehistoric times,\nwhenever new plants and animals were to be domesticated, or new tools\ninvented. On the other hand, it is still open to India, facing the actual\nconditions of the modern\n\np. 262\n\nworld, to prove that the innate capacity of her people for scientific work and\ninquiry has been in no way lessened by this long abstention from its vulgar\nprofits.\n\nIn spite, nevertheless, of the relative non-development of natural science in\nIndia, it is the perfect compatibility of the Hindu religious hypothesis with\nthe highest scientific activity, that is to make that country within the\npresent century the main source of the new synthesis of religion for which we\nin the West are certainly waiting. Several nations cannot suddenly come into\ncontact by the use of a common language without a violent shock being given to\ntheir prejudices in favour of local mythology. Such an occurrence was\ninevitable in English-speaking countries under present circumstances, and has\nbeen accelerated, as it happens, by the agnosticism born of scientific\nactivity. Christianity, moreover, has been further discredited by the\ndiscovery that its adherents possess no ethics sufficiently controlling to\ninfluence their international relations, and finally by that worship of\npleasure which an age of exploitation necessarily engenders. Thus neither the\nsentiment of childhood, the reasoning of theology, the austerity of\nconscience, nor the power of idealism, has been strong enough to maintain the\ncreed of the West against the assaults to which the age has seen it subjected.\nEverything seems to be going through a transition. Social morality,\nintellectual formulas, legal and economic relationships, all have broken loose\nfrom their old moorings, and are seeking for re-adjustment. The first agony of\nthe loss of belief is now over, but it has only given place to a dreary\nhopelessness, a mental and spiritual homelessness, which drives some in whom\nheart predominates into the Church of Rome, while others in whom the faculties\nare more evenly balanced, try to forget their need in social service,\n\np. 263\n\nor in the intellectual and artistic enjoyments of an era of _r esumes_.\n\nProtestantism has at last delivered herself of a genuinely religious product\nof the highest order, in that love of naked truth which finds its voice and\ntype in modern science. For all other forms of non-Catholicism are more or\nless compromises, mere halfway-houses on the road to this. But, even in this,\nthe environment of spirituality and the communion of saints are apt to be left\nbehind with the Mediaeval Church. Is there no way to combine these things? Can\nthe devotional attitude receive no justification from the clear and unbiased\nmind? Does religion, which has made so much of faith, want less than absolute\nconviction as its basis? Is that sentiment which has produced all the greatest\nart, and almost all the greatest conduct, to be relegated to the mental\nlumber-room, as, after all, only a superstition? Surely, if so, there is an\neternal inharmony and divergence between the creative and the inquiring\nfaculties of man.\n\nBut the very constitution of our minds forbids us to accept this paradox. It\nmay be that we are no longer able to believe in the exclusive authenticity of\nany single religious system. But we are fast inclining to the opinion that\neven here there must be some observable sequence; that creeds and mythologies\nmust be as genuine a product of the Unity-of-Things as the animals and the\nplants; that order and meaning there must be, in the one case as in the other.\nInstead, therefore, of a contemptuous disregard of all faiths as equally\nuntrue, we are beginning to adopt to all alike an attitude of respect as\nequally significant.\n\nOnly in India has this recognition of law in religious conceptions ever been\nheld in its completeness as a part of religion itself. Only in India have\ninspired teachers been able to declare that the name\n\np. 264\n\nof God, being also an illusion, differed only from worldly things in having\nthe power of helping us to break our bondage to illusion, while they, on the\nother hand, increased it. Only in India has it been counted orthodoxy to\nbelieve that all is within the mind, that the forms of gods are but\nobjectifications of our own sense of what is best to be attained, that prayer\nis only the heightening of will. And therefore it is from India that we shall\ngather that intellectualisation of belief which is to re-establish, in the\nname of a new and greater synthesis, our confidence in our own past. In this\nnew synthesis every element of our own thought must find a place--the\nconception of humanity and the worship of truth, of course, because without\nthese it would have no _raison d\' etre_. But even the emotionalism of the\nnegro must not go unplaced, uninterpreted, any more than that wondrous mood in\nwhich the explorer of knowledge finds himself launched on a vision of Unity\nthat he dare not name. Neither the Catholic organisation of monasticism nor\nthe Protestant (taken from the Mohammedan) inspiration of common prayer can be\nleft out. There must be a religious consciousness strong enough to recognise\nthe anguish of denial as its own most heroic experience, and large enough to\nbe tender and helpful to the ignorance of a child.\n\nIn that other synthesis which grew up under the Roman Empire, all the\nMediterranean peoples and those originally related to them found a part. The\ndoctrine of immortality came from the desert; resurrection, mediatorship, and\npersonal consciousness of sin from ancient Egypt; many elements from Persia\nand Syria; purity and asceticism from the Asokan Essenes; the basis of ethics\nto be transcended from Judaea; the spirit of inquiry and the necessary feeling\nof an intellectual void from Greece, or at least from the Greek elements in\n\np. 265\n\n[paragraph continues] Mediterranean society; the instinct of organisation from\nRome; and the all-absorbing renunciation and compassion for the world that\nalone can give sufficient nucleus for a new religion from one sweet central\nPersonality, in whom each of these various hungers found its own Bethlehem--\nits house of bread.\n\nSimilarly, in the new up-growth of our own days, many preparatory influences\nnow at work are to find fulfilment. All who have felt the love of the\ndisinherited and oppressed, all who have followed truth for its own sake, all\nwho have longed to lose themselves in a paradise of devotion and been refused\nby the armed reason standing at the gate, all who have felt out for a larger\ngeneralisation, as they saw the faith of their babyhood falling away from\nthem,--all these have helped and are helping to build up the new\nconsciousness, to make the faculty that is to recognise and assimilate the\ndoctrine of the future. But the evangel itself will be mainly drawn from\nIndia.\n\nAnd then, having thus renewed the sources of the world\'s inspiration, we may\nbe pardoned if we ask, What of India herself? The Egyptian delivered up his\nwhole treasure, and where is he now? Buried under many a layer of foreign\ninvasion; tilling the soil as patiently and hopelessly as one of his own oxen;\nscarcely remembered, even as a name, by those who make so-called plans for the\ncountry\'s good, and are wakened only to a stupid wonder, as at the sound of\nsomething familiar from books, when they hear that to kill a cat to-day in the\nbazaar in Cairo would almost cost a man his life. The Jews produced Jesus, and\nwhat have they become? Pariahs and fugitives amongst the nations of men. Who\nremembers them with any feeling of gratitude for that which they have given? A\nmiserable formula, "the Jews who crucified Him," has taken\n\np. 266\n\nthe place amongst the devout of any memorial of the fact that they created the\nlanguage, the thought, the habits of life, and the outlook of righteousness,\nin which He assumed the garb of humanity.\n\nIs something of this sort to be the fate of India? To give a religion to the\nworld may be a sufficient proof that one\'s past was not in vain, but evidently\nit is no sort of safeguard for the future. The process by which the peoples of\na vast continent may become mere hewers of wood and drawers of water has\nalready begun, is already well afoot. Their indigenous institutions are all in\ndecay. Their prosperity is gone. Some portion or other of the immense\nagricultural area is perpetually under famine. Their arts and industries are\ndead or dying. They have lapsed into mere customers for other men\'s cheap\nwares. Even their thought would seem to be mainly imitative. The orthodox is\napt to tread the round of his own past eternally. The unorthodox is as apt to\nharness himself to the foreign present, with an equal blindness. In suicidal\ndesperation, the would-be patriotic reiterate the war-cries of antagonistic\nsects, or moan for the advent of a new religion, as if, by introducing a fifth\nelement of discord, the Indian peoples could reach unity. Nor does the\neducation at present offered promise any solution of the problem. It is the\nminimum that is possible to the efficient clerk, and even that minimum is\nundergoing reduction rather than increase.\n\nIn spite of the absence of any theory of history that might elucidate the\ncourse of events in the East during the next two centuries, one truth reveals\nitself with perfect plainness. A nation becomes whatever she believes herself\nto be. She is made great, not by her relative superiority, but by her thought\nabout herself. It becomes important therefore\n\np. 267\n\nto ask--What conception of her own nature and power forms the inheritance of\nIndia?\n\nAs Roman Catholicism is but one element inhering in a great whole called\nChristianity, and as a man may well claim to be a good Christian without being\na Catholic, so the religious system of Hinduism is only a fragment inhering in\na vast social-industrial-economic scheme called the dharmma, and a man may\nwell and rightly be the servant of the dharmma, without calling himself a\nHindu. It is this dharmma, in its large and non-sectarian activity, that\ndetermines the well-being of every child of the Indian soil. The word itself\nis an ancient name for national righteousness or national good. It is true\nthat the Brahmin who bows before one who is net the rightful king is held many\ntimes accursed by Manu. It is true that the Bhagavad Gita is the only one of\nthe world-gospels that turns on the duty of fighting for the true sovereign\nagainst usurpers. And yet it is also a fact that the person of the ruler is\nalways a matter of singular indifference to the theocratic consciousness. It\nhas been hitherto indeed a mere detail for military persons to fight out\namongst themselves. The secret of so curious an attitude is reached when we\ndiscover that in the eyes of the Indian peasant, the sovereign himself is only\nthe servant of the dharmma. "If he uphold it, he will stay: if not, he will\nhave to go," they all say when questioned. Little do they dream, alas! that\nthemselves and their children and their children\'s children may be swept into\noblivion also by that same failure to uphold!\n\nThus, whoever was the master that an Indian statesman served, whether Hindu,\nMussulman, or British sat upon the throne, it was the minister\'s duty, as the\nloyal and obedient child of an Asiatic race, to use all his influence in the\nbest interests of his people and his country. It is this element in the\nnational system that tends, with its great regard\n\np. 268\n\nfor agriculture, to rank the cow almost on a level with the human members of\nthe commonwealth, making the Hindu sovereign forbid beef-eating within his\nfrontiers. It was this that made a certain prince, in despair, hand over his\nsalt-mines to the British Government, rather than obey its mandate to tax this\ncommodity to his people, and thus derive personal benefit from their\nmisfortune. It was this that made it incumbent upon many of the chiefs in the\nold days to provide, not only salt, but also water and fruit free to their\nsubjects, a kind of "noblesse oblige" that has left the wayside orchard\noutside every village in Kashmir, till that favoured land is almost like the\nhappy island of Avilion, "fair with orchard lawns, and bowery hollows crowned\nwith summer sea." It was this power of the dharmma to safeguard the welfare of\nits people, through a law as binding upon the monarch as upon his subjects,\nthat brought about the immense network of custom which regulated the relief of\nbeggars, the use of water, the provisioning of pilgrimages, habits of\nsanitation, distribution of grazing-lands, the forest-rights of the peasant,\nand a thousand other matters of importance. The mere fact that the king\'s\npersonal devotions were offered in a mosque could not interfere with his\nacceptance of the system, in any important measure. It was the language of\nrule, dominating all rulers alike, by every detail of birth and upbringing,\nand by the very impossibility of imagining any deviation. Hence it could never\nbe more than a question of time till some new prince had assimilated the\nwhole, and Mussulman cooperated actively with Hindu in the great task of\nenforcing and extending the essentials of the common weal. We may regret, but\nwe cannot condone, the strange indolence by which the Indian people have\npermitted themselves to lose sight of these national and civic\nresponsibilities of their\n\np. 269\n\nancient civilisation, and become absorbed in its personal and domestic rites.\nNor can we for one moment admit that this substitution of the trees for the\nforest deserves the name of orthodoxy,--faithfulness to the dharmma.\n\nIt is, however, an essential weakness of theocratic rule that while it can\ntolerate any neighbour, it has no idea of dominating and unifying diverse\nelements round itself. The great mass of its subjects, too, see life\nindirectly through the nimbus of the supernatural. Instead of subordinating\nthe priesthood in national affairs to the recognised leaders of the nation,\nexalting it only in its rightful capacity of influence upon the social and\nindividual conscience, a theocracy is apt to require that its leaders move,\nencumbered by the counsels of the priests.\n\nIt was the Prophet\'s clear perception of these facts that gave its peculiar\ncharacteristics to Islam. He established a strong confraternity, and made\nsubscription to a brief and concise formula its sole condition of membership.\nBut Arab blood was comparatively unmixed, and the greater part of Mohammed\'s\nwork was done for him, in the close bond of consanguinity that united his\ncentral group. At one bound, and without any means save that power of\npersonality which is the first demand of the theocratic method, he performed\nthe double task of creating an all-absorbing consciousness of nationality, and\ncarrying his people through the required emancipation of thought. To this day\nthe great Semitised belt that divides Eastern Aryans and Mongolians from\nEurope, reminds us, whenever we look at the map, of the reality of his\nachievement. And the history of the origins of European learning remains to\nattest the enthusiasm of freedom which he conferred on the Saracenic\nintellect.\n\nGeographical conditions impose upon India the same necessity of unification at\nall costs, and yet\n\np. 270\n\ncombine with other facts to make her the meeting-ground of all races.\nEspecially is this the case in modern times, when the ocean has become a\nroadway instead of a boundary. She is almost a museum of races, creeds, and\nsocial formations, some hoary with age, some crude with excessive youth. Thus\nher problem is vastly more difficult than that of Arabia before the seventh\ncentury. Yet she contains in herself every element of self-recovery.\n\nIf the fact had been open to doubt before, the British rule, with its\nrailways, its cheap postage, and its common language of affairs, would\nsufficiently have demonstrated the territorial unity of the country. We can\nsee to-day that India\'s is an organic, and no mere mechanical, unity. "The\nNorth," it has been said, "produces prophets, the South priests." And it is\ntrue that her intellectual and discriminating faculty, her power of\nrecognition and formulation, lies in the South; that Mahratta, Mussulman and\nSikh, form her executive; while to Bengal, the country that has fought no\nbattle for her own boundaries, falls the office of the heart, which will yet\nsuffuse all the rest with the realisation of the vast inclusiveness of meaning\nof the great word "India." Historically the Indian unity is obvious. And if\nsocially it appear doubtful, the country itself could set aside the doubt in\nan instant by grasping that intuition of nationality which alone is needed to\ngive the spiritual impulse toward consolidation.\n\nBut the bare fact of an actual social, historical, and geographical unity,\nwaiting for precipitation as a national consciousness, is not the only\npossession of India at the present crisis. She has a great past to return\nupon, and a clearly defined economy for model. Her traditions are unstained.\nThere is no element of national life--art, poetry, literature, philosophy,\nscience--in which she has not at some\n\np. 271\n\ntime been exceptionally strong. She has organised at least two empires of\ncommanding character. In architecture, three of the most imposing styles in\nthe world have been hers--the Dravidian in the South, the Buddhist across\nmiddle India from Orissa to Bombay, and the Indo-Saracenic in the North.\n\nThere can be little doubt that her next period will confront India with the\nnecessity of introducing some community of ritual as between priest and\npeople; and this of itself must create fresh architectural needs, a new\narchitecture of the communal consciousness which would be sufficient to make\nthe required appeal to the national imagination, and at the same time give the\nneeded scope to the passion of democracy.\n\nFor in looking to the growth of a sentiment or nationality as the solution of\nIndian problems, we are of course turning away from kings and priests, and\nappealing to Woman and the People. A similar appeal, in the only form possible\nto the unmixed theocracy of that day, was made by Buddhism; and the whole\nhistory of India, from the Christian era onwards, is the story of the\neducation of the popular consciousness, by the unifying and ameliorating\ninfluence of Hinduism, as it was then thrown open. To-day, if we adopt, moral\nand intellectual tests as the criteria of civilisation, we can hardly refuse\nto admit that in such issues the East has been more successful than the West.\nIn strength of family ties; in sweetness and decorum of family life; in\nwidespread understanding of the place of the personal development in the\nscheme of religion as a whole; in power of enjoyment of leisure, without gross\nphysical accompaniments; in dignity, frugality, continuous industry without\naggressive activity; in artistic appreciation of work done and doing: and\nabove all in the ability to concentrate the whole faculty at will, even the\npoorest classes in India,\n\np. 272\n\nwhatever their religion, will compare favourably with many who are far above\nthem in the West. Such are some of the results of the Buddhist period.\n\nThe Mogul Empire fell into decay and failed, simply because it did not\nunderstand how to base itself on a great popular conception of Indian unity.\nIt could neither assimilate the whole of the religious impulse of India, nor\nyet detach itself completely from it. Hence, as a government, it succeeded\nneither in rooting itself permanently, nor in creating that circuit of\nnational energy which alone could have given it endurance. Nevertheless, it\ncontributed invaluable elements to the national life of the future, and it is\ndifficult to see how that life could hope to organise itself without its\nmemorable preliminary experiment.\n\nThe foreign character of the English period produced, as its first effect, a\nwide sense of bewilderment and unrest, which gave birth to a hundred projected\npanaceas. There were social reformers, who thought that by a programme more\npurely destructive than they then realised, their Motherland would be best\nserved. And while we may deprecate the form taken by their zeal, we can but\nadmit that no other testimony could have been given to the living energy of\nthe race which would have been so convincing. If Indian civilisation had\nreally been stationary, as is so sapiently supposed by the West, the embers\ncould hardly have leaped into such flame, at the bare touch of new ideas. If,\non the other hand, the country had accepted the superficial theory, and run\nagate in the endeavour to reform itself, we could not thereafter have\nconceived of India as possessing sufficient depth and stability to make hope\npossible. Meanwhile the reformers have not failed to bring forth fruit. They\nhave produced groups of persons who represent what is valuable in Western\nthought and habits,\n\np. 273\n\nwithout necessarily being denationalised, and they have demonstrated once for\nall the fact that India contains sufficient forces of restitution within\nherself to be completely independent of foreign advice and criticism.\n\nNext came political agitators, who seemed to think that by entire deference to\nan alien idea their country would be saved. There can be no doubt that here\nalso a valuable contribution had been made. The foreign idea can never save\nIndia--indeed, the use of the word "politics" in the present state of the\ncountry may strike some of us as a painful insincerity--but at the same time,\nthe mastery and assimilation of the foreigners\' _method_ is an absolute\nnecessity. The education of the people, also, to a knowledge of their common\ninterests, and the throwing of a net of friendship and mutual intercourse all\nover the country, are great services.\n\nOutside social and political movements, again, there are a hundred\nemancipations and revivals of religious centres, all of which are noteworthy\nsymptoms of inherent vitality. And still a fourth school declares that the one\nquestion of India lies in the economic crisis, and that that once surmounted\nall will be well.\n\nAt this moment, however, a new suspicion is making itself heard, a suspicion\nthat behind all these interpretations--the social reform, the political\nagitation, religious movements, and economic grievances--there stands a\ngreater reality, dominating and co-ordinating the whole, the Indian national\nidea, of which each is a part. It begins to be thought that there is a\nreligious idea that may be called Indian, but it is of no single sect; that\nthere is a social idea, which is the property of no caste or group; that there\nis a historic evolution, in which all are united; that it is the thing within\n_all_ these\n\np. 274\n\nwhich alone is to be called "India." If this conception should prevail, it\nwill be seen that social, political, economic, and religious workers have all\nalike helped to reveal it; but it can never be allowed that the whole problem\nis economic, grave as the last-mentioned feature of the situation undoubtedly\nis. It is not merely the status, but the very nature and character of the\ncollective personality of a whole nation, occupying one of the largest areas\nin the world, that has to be recaptured. In the days when ancient Egypt made\nan eternal impression on human civilisation, the personal belongings of her\ngreat nobles were no more than those of an Indian cowherd to-day. It was the\nsentiment of fraternity, the instinct of synthesis, the mind of co-ordination,\nthat were the secret of her power.\n\nThe distinctive spirituality of the modern world depends upon its ability to\nthink of things as a whole, to treat immense masses of facts as units, to\nbring together many kinds of activity, and put them in true relation to one\nanother. This is the reality of which map, census, and newspaper, even\ncatalogue, museum and encyclopaedia, are but outer symbols. In proportion as\nshe grasps this inner content will India rise to the height of her own\npossibilities.\n\nThe sacraments of a growing nationality would lie in new developments of her\nold art, a new application of her old power of learnedness, new and dynamic\nreligious interpretations, a new idealism in short, true child of the nation\'s\nown past, with which the young should throb and the old be reverent. The test\nof its success would be the combining of renewed local and individual vigour\nwith a power of self-centralisation and self-expression hitherto unknown.\n\nBut before such a result could come about, we must suppose the children of\nevery province and every sect on fire with the love of the Motherland.\n\np. 275\n\n[paragraph continues] Sikh, Mahratta, and Mussulman, we must imagine possessed\neach by the thought of _India_ , not of his own group. Thus each name\ndistinguished in the history of any part would be appropriated by the country\nas a whole. The Hindu would prostrate himself on the steps of the mosque, the\nMohammedan offer salutation before the temple, the Aryan write the history of\nIslam with an enthusiasm impossible to those within its walls, the Semite\nstand forth as the exponent of India\'s heroic past, with the authority of one\nwho sees for the first time with the eyes of manhood. For we cannot think that\na mere toleration of one another\'s peculiarities can ever be enough to build\nup national sentiment in India. As the love of David and Jonathan, a love the\nstronger for distance of birth, such is that last and greatest passion which\nawakes in him who hears the sorrowful crying of the young and defenceless\nchildren of his own mother. Each difference between himself and them is a\nsource of joy. Each need unknown to himself feeds his passion for self-\nsacrifice. Their very sins meet with no condemnation from him, their sworn\nchampion and servant.\n\nBut has India, to-day the hidden strength for such developments? What of the\ntheocratic consciousness? What of warring religious convictions?\n\nWhether or not she has adequate strength for her own renewal, only the sons of\nIndia are competent to judge. But it is certain that in the nationalising of a\ngreat nation, the two theocracies would reach, on the human side, their common\nflowering-point. Do not all kingdoms of GOD hold forth the hope of a day when\nthe lame shall walk, and the blind see, the leper be cleansed, and the poor\nhave the Gospel preached unto them? The theocratic consciousness is never\njealous of the social good, but profoundly susceptible of it. It seeks it\nindeed as its true goal. What of the theocratic consciousness, what of\nreligion, should a day ever come to pass in\n\np. 276\n\nwhich men discovered that divine revelations were meant to unite humanity, not\nto sunder it? Surely the question is hardly serious. The old orthodoxy of the\nArab would still be the austerity of the Mohammedan. The ancient piety of the\nHindu would still and for ever be the church of the devoted life. Yet both\nwould have found new purpose and common scope, in the re-making of the\nMotherland.\n\nNevertheless, the question remains. The road is clear, but has India strength\nto follow it?\n\nJackals prowl about the buried cities and deserted temples of the Asokan era.\nOnly a memory dwells within the marble palaces of the Mogul. Is the mighty\nMother not now exhausted? Having given to the world, is it not enough? Is she\nagain to rouse and bestir herself for the good of her own household? Who can\ntell? Yet in all impotence and desolation of the present, amidst the ruin of\nhis country and the decay of his pride, an indomitable hope wakes still in the\nheart of the Indian peasant. "That which is, shall pass: and that which has\nbeen, shall again be," he mutters "to the end of time." And we seem to catch\nin his words the sound of a greater prophecy, of which this is but the echo--\n\n"Whenever the dharmma decays, and a-dharmma prevails, then I manifest myself.\nFor the protection of the good, for the destruction of the evil, for the firm\nestablishment of  \n                        THE NATIONAL RIGHTEOUSNESS  \nI am born again and again."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINTED AT THE COMPLETE PRESS  \nWEST NORWOOD  \nLONDON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[257:*](wil18.htm#fr_42) The Charvaka system of philosophy, one of the\northodox schools, is a purely agnostic formulation, I have myself met a\nCharvaka on a pilgrimage.
