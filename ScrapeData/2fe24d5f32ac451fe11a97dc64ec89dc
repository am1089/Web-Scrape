The Linga Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n11\\. Linga Puran\xcc\x81a. "Where Mahe\xc5\x9bwara, present in the Agni Linga, explained\n(the objects of life) virtue, wealth, pleasure, and final liberation at the\nend of the Agni Kalpa, that Puran\xcc\x81a, consisting of eleven thousand stanzas,\nwas called the Lainga by Brahma himself 66."\n\nThe Linga Puran\xcc\x81a conforms accurately enough to this description. The Kalpa is\nsaid to be the \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bana, but this is the only difference. It consists of eleven\nthousand stanzas. It is said to have been originally composed by Brahma; and\nthe primitive Linga is a pillar of radiance,\n\np. xliii\n\nin which Mahe\xc5\x9bwara is present. The work is therefore the same as that referred\nto by the Matsya.\n\nA short account is given, in the beginning, of elemental and secondary\ncreation, and of the patriarchal families; in which, however, \xc5\x9aiva takes the\nplace of Vishn\xcc\x81u, as the indescribable cause of all things. Brief accounts of\n\xc5\x9aiva\'s incarnations and proceedings in different Kalpas next occur, offering\nno interest except as characteristic of sectarial notions. The appearance of\nthe great fiery Linga takes place, in the interval of a creation, to separate\nVishn\xcc\x81u and Brahma, who not only dispute the palm of supremacy, but fight for\nit; when the Linga suddenly springs up, and puts them both to shame; as, after\ntravelling upwards and downwards for a thousand years in each direction,\nneither can approach to its termination. Upon the Linga the sacred\nmonosyllable Om is visible, and the Vedas proceed from it, by which Brahms and\nVishn\xcc\x81u become enlightened, and acknowledge and eulogize the superior might\nand glory of \xc5\x9aiva.\n\nA notice of the creation in the Padma Kalpa then follows, and this leads to\npraises of \xc5\x9aiva by Vishn\xcc\x81u and Brahma. \xc5\x9aiva repeats the story of his\nincarnations, twenty-eight in number; intended as a counterpart, no doubt, to\nthe twenty-four Avataras of Vishn\xcc\x81u, as described in the Bhagavata; and both\nbeing amplifications of the original ten Avataras, and of much less merit as\nfictions. Another instance of rivalry occurs in the legend of Dadhichi, a Muni\nand worshipper of \xc5\x9aiva. In the Bhagavata there is a story of Ambarisha being\ndefended against Durvasas by the discus of Vishn\xcc\x81u, against which that \xc5\x9aaiva\nsage is helpless: here Vishn\xcc\x81u hurls his discus at Dadhichi, but it falls\nblunted to the ground, and a conflict ensues, in which Vishn\xcc\x81u and his\npartisans are all overthrown by the Muni.\n\nA description of the universe, and of the regal dynasties of the Vaivaswata\nManwantara to the time of Krishn\xcc\x81a, runs through a number of chapters, in\nsubstance, and very commonly in words, the same as in other Puran\xcc\x81as. After\nwhich, the work resumes its proper character, narrating legends, and enjoining\nrites, and reciting prayers, intending to do honour to \xc5\x9aiva under various\nforms. Although, however, the Linga\n\np. xliv\n\nholds a prominent place amongst them, the spirit of the worship is as little\ninfluenced by the character of the type as can well be imagined. There is\nnothing like the phallic orgies of antiquity: it is all mystical and\nspiritual. The Linga is twofold, external and internal. The ignorant, who need\na visible sign, worship \xc5\x9aiva through a \'mark\' or \'type\'--which is the proper\nmeaning of the word \'Linga\'--of wood or stone; but the wise look upon this\noutward emblem as nothing, and contemplate in their minds the invisible,\ninscrutable type, which is \xc5\x9aiva himself. Whatever may have been the origin of\nthis form of worship in India, the notions upon which it was founded,\naccording to the impure fancies of European writers, are not to be traced in\neven the \xc5\x9aaiva Puran\xcc\x81as.\n\nData for conjecturing the era of this work are defective, but it is more of a\nritual than a Puran\xcc\x81a, and the Pauran\xcc\x81ik chapters which it has inserted, in\norder to keep up something of its character, have been evidently borrowed for\nthe purpose. The incarnations of \xc5\x9aiva, and their \'pupils,\' as specified in one\nplace, and the importance attached to the practice of the Yoga, render it\npossible that under the former are intended those teachers of the \xc5\x9aaiva\nreligion who belong to the Yoga school 67, which seems to have flourished\nabout the eighth or ninth centuries. It is not likely that the work is\nearlier, it may be considerably later. It has preserved apparently some \xc5\x9aaiva\nlegends of an early date, but the greater part is ritual and mysticism of\ncomparatively recent introduction.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xlii:66](vp015.htm#fr_65) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_04200.jpg)\n\n[xliv:67](vp015.htm#fr_66) See Asiatic Researches, vol.
