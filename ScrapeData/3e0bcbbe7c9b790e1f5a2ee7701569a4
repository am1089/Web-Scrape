'On high' means 'not on the ground' (Naraya\n_n_ a). On the gaudanika _m_ karma (the shaving of the beard), comp. above,\nAdhyaya I, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 18\\. The word 'ceremony' would mean here, according\nto Naraya _n_ a, that he should perform the rite alone, without observing such\nprescriptions as stated above, I, 18, 7.\n\n[227:7](sbe29141.htm#fr_552) Thus, instead of 'Herb! protect him!' (I, 17, 8)\nhe is to say, 'Herb! protect me!' and so on.\n\n[227:8](sbe29141.htm#fr_553) Ekaklitaka is, according to Naraya _n_ a and the\nPrayogaratna, the seed of such a Kara _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a fruit (Pongamia Glabra, Vent.)\nwhich contains only one grain of seed. Such grains are pounded before he rubs\nhimself therewith.\n\n[228:21](sbe29141.htm#fr_554) On the hymn beginning with the words 'Giving\nlife,' see Prof. Stenzler's note on this Sutra. Its first verse is identical\nwith Va _g_ asaneyi Sa _m_ hita XXXIV, 50 (comp. also _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya\nIII, 1, 7), and so are most of its verses found in that Sa _m_ hita or in the\nAtharva-veda; the whole of it occurs among the Rig-veda Khilas (vol. vi, p.\n25, 2-12).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 9](sbe29142.htm)\n\n"
