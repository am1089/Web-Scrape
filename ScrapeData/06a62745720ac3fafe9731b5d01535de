And thus (on that doctrine) there would be an accomplishment (of ends) in\nthe case of non-active people also.\n\nIf it were admitted that entity issues from non-entity, lazy inactive people\nalso would obtain their purposes, since 'non-existence' is a thing to be had\nwithout much trouble. Rice would grow for the husbandman even if he did not\ncultivate his field; vessels would shape themselves even if the potter did not\nfashion the clay; and the weaver too\n\np. 418\n\nlazy to weave the threads into a whole, would nevertheless have in the end\nfinished pieces of cloth just as if he had been weaving. And nobody would have\nto exert himself in the least either for going to the heavenly world or for\nobtaining final release. All which of course is absurd and not maintained by\nanybody.--Thus the doctrine of the origination of entity from non-entity again\nshows itself to be futile.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 28](sbe34204.htm)\n\n"
