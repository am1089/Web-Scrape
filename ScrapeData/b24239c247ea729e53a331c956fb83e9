O great king! all his queens thus\nconstantly performed various acts of attendance on Krishnu, who made them\ncompletely happy.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, O great\nking! after some years, each of the wives of the lord of the Judoos brought\nforth children; each having a daughter, equalling Luchmee, and ten dutiful\nsons. Thus the number of children amounted to a lakh and sixty-one thousand,\nall alike, and possessed of unbounded excellence\n\np. 287\n\nof mind, strength and beauty, all of them of the colour of clouds, with\ncountenances like the moon, lotus eyes, dressed in blue and yellow frocks, and\nwearing knotted strings, necklaces and amulets on their necks, pleased and\ngratified their parents by their childish sports and pastimes in each house:\nand their mothers brought them up with the most tender and affectionate care.\nO great king! on hearing of the birth of Shree Krishnu Chund\'s sons, Rookum\nsaid to his wife, "I will not now give my daughter Charoomutee to Kritbruma\'s\nson, to whom she has been betrothed, but will allow her to choose a husband\nfor herself; send some one to invite my sister Rookmunee with her sons."\n\nOn hearing these words, Rookum\'s wife wrote a most pressing letter of\ninvitation to her brother\'s sister and her sons, which she sent by the hand of\na brahmin, and made preparations for the ceremony of her daughter selecting a\nhusband for herself. On receipt of her brother\'s wife\'s invitation, Rookmunee\nhaving obtained the permission of Shree Krishnu Chund, took leave and starting\nfrom Dwarka with her son, arrived at her brother\'s house at Bhojkut. Rookum\nwas highly delighted at seeing her, and respectfully bowed his head; falling\nat her feet, his wife said, "This is the first visit you have paid us, since\nyou were carried off." She again said to Rookmunee, "O sister-in-law! as you\nhave come here, kindly take compassion upon us, and receive this our daughter,\nCharoomutee, for your son." Rookmunee Jee replied, "You know your husband\'s\ndisposition; do not give occasion for him to quarrel with any one, there is no\nunderstanding or depending on my brother; who knows what he may do, for this\nreason, both his words and actions excite apprehension." Rookum said, "Fear\nnot, sister! there shall be no violence, it is an injunction of the Vedas, to\ngive a daughter in marriage to a sister\'s son in the Deccan country, for this\nreason, I will give my daughter, Charoomutee, to your son, Purdiyomun; and,\nabandoning my habit of enmity towards\n\np. 288\n\n[paragraph continues] Shree Krishnu Jee, unite myself to him by a new bond of\nrelationship."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, when Rookum, rising thence, went to the\ncourt, Purdiyomun having arrayed himself in full dress, went also, with his\nmother\'s permission, to the assembly that was collected on the occasion of\nCharoomutee selecting a husband for herself. He beheld Rajas of all countries\nstanding there with the hope of marriage, splendidly dressed, and wearing a\nvariety of jewels and ornaments. And the young girl was moving about in the\nmiddle of the crowd with a garland in her hand, and looking in every\ndirection, but her glance did not rest upon any one. In the mean while, when\nPurdiyomun Jee entered the assembly, she was fascinated at beholding him, and\ncame and threw the garland on his neck. All the Rajas beheld the act with\nregret, and remained standing there in a state of disappointment and pique;\nand began to say to themselves, "Let us see whether he will lead away this\ngirl in our presence, we will carry her off on the road."\n\nO great king! the Rajas thus continued discoursing to themselves; and Rookum,\nhaving taken the bride and bridegroom under the temporary building which had\nbeen erected for the occasion, and having made a solemn vow in the manner\nprescribed by the Vedas, gave away his daughter; and bestowed upon her a dowry\nof unbounded wealth and riches; when Shree Rookmunee Jee had celebrated her\nson\'s marriage, and taken leave of her brother and his wife, she mounted her\nchariot, taking with her, her son and daughter-in-law, and started for Dwarka.\nThe Rajas then came in a body, and blocked up the road, with the view of\nfighting and forcibly carrying off Purdiyomun\'s bride.\n\nObserving their wicked design, Purdiyomun seized his arms, and prepared for\nbattle. The battle lasted for some time between them; when at length\nPurdiyomun, having slain and routed them all, arrived joyfully and happily at\nDwarka.\n\np. 289\n\nOn hearing of their arrival, all their relations, male and female, came\noutside the city, and observing the usual and prescribed ceremonies, and\nspreading silken cloths on the ground, conducted them in musical procession;\nthere was rejoicing throughout the city, and they dwelt happily in the royal\npalace.\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O great king! after some years, a son was born to Purdiyomun, the\nson of Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy. On that occasion, Shree Krishnu\nJee sent for astrologers; and, having had seats placed for all his relations,\ngave a festive entertainment, and made preparations for giving a name to the\nchild in the manner prescribed by the Shastrus. The astrologers, consulting\ntheir almanacs, and having fixed upon the year, month, half-month, solar and\nlunar day, the hour, the rising of the sign and the twenty-seventh division of\nthe zodiack, gave the child the name of Unroodru. On that occasion, when\nPurdiyomun had a son, Krishnu was so overjoyed, that his body could not\ncontain him; and he could not be surfeited with giving presents and gifts to\nthe brahmins.\n\nO great king! having received intelligence of the birth of Krishnu\'s grandson,\nRookum wrote a letter to his sister and her husband in terms of great\naffection, proposing a marriage between the grandson and his grand-daughter,\nand mentioning that the match would afford him great delight. And afterwards,\nhe sent for a brahmin; and, giving him a red mixture for the forehead,\nunbroken rice, a rupee and a cocoanut explained to him and said, "Go to\nDwarka, and making many supplications, in my name, give the nuptial presents\nto Unroodru, Krishnu\'s grandson, and my daughter\'s son." On receiving this\norder the brahmin, taking with him the nuptial gifts and presents, proceeded\non his journey, and arrived at Shree Krishnu Chund\'s house at Dwarka. On\nseeing him, Krishnu, treating him with the greatest respect and honour,\n\np. 290\n\nenquired, "What, O divinity! is the occasion of your coming here?" The brahmin\nreplied, "O great king! I have been sent by Raja Bheekmuk\'s son, Rookum; and\nhave brought the nuptial gifts and presents for an alliance between his grand-\ndaughter, and your grandson."\n\nOn hearing this message, Shree Krishnu Jee sent for ten of his relations; and,\nhaving received the nuptial presents, and given many gifts to the brahmin,\nallowed him to take leave; and went to his brother, Bulram, to make\narrangements for the journey. Afterwards, the two brothers started thence, and\nwent to the Raja Bheekmuk; and, having informed him of what had been proposed,\ntook leave. Having come forth, they began to make all necessary arrangements,\nand collect all things necessary for the marriage procession; when, after some\ndays, these arrangements were completed, and every thing was ready, Krishnu\nwent in great pomp and splendour, with the marriage procession, from Dwarka to\nthe city of Bhojkut. At that time, Shree Rookmunee Jee sat upon a glittering\nruth with her son and grandson, and Shree Krishnu and Bulram were seated upon\nanother ruth. At length after some days Krishnu arrived at Dwarka with them\nall.\n\nO great king! on arrival of the marriage procession, Rookum, together with the\nRajas of Kuling and other countries, went outside the city to meet it; and\nhaving invested all composing the procession in honorary dresses, and\nreceiving them with the utmost respect and honour, escorted them to the\nappointed place of reception at the bride\'s house; afterwards, having\nentertained them, he had them conducted to a hall erected for the occasion\nadorned with flowers, and he gave away the virgin in the manner prescribed by\nthe Vedas; and he bestowed upon her so rich a marriage portion, that an\naccount of it is impossible.\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! when the marriage ceremonies had been performed, Raja Bheekmuk went to\nthe place of reception\n\np. 291\n\nat the bride\'s house, and, joining his hands and using much entreaty,\nwhispered to Shree Krishnu Chund, and said, "O great king! the marriage has\nbeen completed, and everything has gone on well; be pleased to make\narrangements for a speedy departure, because his relations, the Rajas whom\nRookum has invited, are all wicked and violent men. Do not let there be any\nquarrelling. I, therefore, have taken an opportunity of speaking to you,\nMoorari." When he had thus spoken, and went away, Rookum came near Shree\nRookmunee, and then Rookmunee exclaimed, "How shall we be able to return home?\nYour guests, the Rajas, are hostile, who are united with you; if you mean\nwell, brother, arrange so that we may quickly reach home, otherwise you will\nsee a pleasant state of affairs, succeeded by an unpleasant one." Rookum\nreplied, "Sister! be not at all anxious, I will first of all allow the\ndifferent Rajas, who have come as my guests, to take leave, and will\nafterwards do as you wish." With these words Rookum went thence to his royal\nguests; they all coming in a body, began to say, "Rookum! you have given so\nmuch wealth to Krishnu and Buldeo; and they through pride have not acted at\nall well, this is one subject of regret to us; and we are grieved on another\naccount, which is, that Bulram brought dishonour upon you."\n\nO great king! Rookum was angry at this speech, when the Raja of Kuling, said,\n"I have something to say, which, with your permission, I will mention." Rookum\nreplied, "Mention it." The Rajas said, "We have no concern with Shree Krishnu,\nbut send for Bulram; and we will play at _choupur_ with him, and win all his\nmoney: and great as his pride is, we will send him away hence empty-handed."\nWhen Kuling had thus spoken, Rookum, after reflecting for a short time, went\nto Bulram Jee, and said, "O great king! all the Rajas send their compliments,\nand have invited you to play at _choupur_." On hearing this, Bulbhuddru went\nto\n\np. 292\n\naccept the challenge; the Rajas rose, and bowed their heads on his coming. The\nRajas then said with the greatest politeness to Raja Bulram, "You have had\ngreat practice at the game of _choupur_ , we, therefore, wish to play with\nyou." With these words, they brought out and spread a cloth for playing at\n_choupur_ ; and Rookum and Bulram began playing; at first Rookum won ten\ntimes, and then said to Buldeo Jee, "You have lost all your money; what will\nyou stake now?" The Raja of Kuling applauded this speech, and laughed.\nObserving this, Buldeo Jee bent his head, and became thoughtful; Rookum then\nstaked ten crores of rupees at once, which when Bulram had won and taken up,\nthey all began to wrangle and said, "Rookum\'s dice has fallen, (that is, he\nhas won,) why are you collecting the money?" Bulram returned the whole sum on\nhearing this, and staking a hundred millions took up the dice. Bulram won\nagain, and Rookum lost; the Rajas, cheated a second time, and said, "That\nRookum had won," and thus exclaimed, "What do you know about gambling and\ndice, you mean villager! Rajas understand war and play, cowherds only\nunderstand about cows."\n\nOn hearing this speech, the anger of Buldeo Jee was excited in the same\nmanner, that the waves of the sea are swollen at the full moon. Bulram,\nhowever, reasoning within himself, contrived to stifle his wrath; and making\nanother stake of seven millions, played again; again Buldeo won, and then\nagain the Rajas falsely declared "That Rookum had gained the game." When they\nhad thus cheated, there was a voice from heaven, "Huldhur won and Rookum lost;\nO Rajas! why have you spoken falsely?"\n\nO great king! when Rookum and the other Rajas having heard the voice from\nheaven, pretended not to hear it, Buldeo Jee was exceedingly angry, and said,\n"Although you have allied yourself with me by marriage, you have again\nquarrelled with me; O unjust and dishonest man! I will now\n\np. 293\n\nput you to death, whatever opinion my brother\'s wife may form of the deed. I\nwill not now listen to any one on this subject, but will to-day deprive you of\nlife, you deceitful wretch."\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit, O king! after some delay, Bulram killed Rookum in the sight of all\npresent: and having thrown Kuling down, knocked out all his teeth with blows,\nand said to him, "You also showed your teeth and laughed." After this, having\nslain and put to flight all the Rajas, Bulram came to the place of reception\nat the bride\'s house, and mentioned all that had occurred to Shree Krishnu\nChund. On hearing the account, Huri departed thence with all his party, and\nhad a safe and pleasant journey to Dwarka; joy was diffused throughout the\ncity on his arrival, and there were festivities in every house. Shree Krishnu\nJee and Buldeo Jee went into the presence of Raja Oogursen, and said, "O great\nking! through your excellence and glory, we have celebrated Unroodru\'s\nmarriage, and have destroyed the very wicked Rookum."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXIII](psa64.htm)\n\n'
