But in the case of the getting rid of (it has to be combined with the\nobtaining), as it is supplementary\n\np. 646\n\nto statements of obtaining; as in the case of the ku _s_ as, the metres, the\npraise, and the singing. This has been explained.\n\nThe _Kh_ andogas read in their text 'Shaking off all evil as a horse shakes\nhis hair, and shaking off the body as the moon frees herself from the mouth of\nRahu, I obtain the world of Brahman ' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 13). The \xc3\x82tharva _n_\nikas have 'He who knows, shaking off good and evil, free from passion, reaches\nthe highest oneness.' The _S_ a _t_ yayanins have ' His sons obtain his\ninheritance, his friends the good, his enemies the evil he has done.' The\nKaushitakins 'He shakes off his good and his evil deeds. His beloved relatives\nobtain the good, his unbeloved relatives the evil he has done.' Two of these\ntexts mention only the shaking off, on the part of him who knows, of his good\nand evil woiks; one mentions only the obtainment of these works, on the part\nof friends and enemies; and one mentions both these occurrences.--Now both the\noccurrences, although mentioned in several meditations, must be considered\nelements of all meditations: for whoever, on the basis of a knowledge of\nBrahman, reaches Brahman, necessarily leaves behind all his good and evil\nworks, and those works unless thus left behind cannot be obtained by others.\nMeditation on those two matters therefore enters as an element into all\nmeditations. The doubtful point, however, is whether there is option between\nthe meditation on the abandonment of works, and that on the obtainment of\nworks by others, and that on both these events; or whether in each case all\nthese meditations are to be combined.--There is option, the Purvapakshin\nholds; for the reason that the texts make different declarations on this\npoint. For, if the meditations had to be combined, there would be in each case\nmeditation on both the matters mentioned; and as such double meditation is\nestablished by the Kaushitakin text, it would follow that the statements of\nthe other texts are without meaning. Thus the only motive for the declarations\nmade in different places can be to allow option. Nor must this conclusion be\ncontroverted on the ground that declarations of the same\n\np. 647\n\nmatter, made in different places, are made with reference to the difference of\nstudents severally reading the several texts; for this holds good in those\ncases only where identical statements are made in different texts; while in\nthe case under discussion two _s_ akhas mention the abandonment of works, and\none their passing over to other persons. Nor can you account for the\ndifference of statement on the ground of difference of vidyas; for you\nyourself maintain that the meditations in question form part of all\nmeditations.--This view the Sutra impugns, 'but where the getting rid of is\nmentioned,' &c. Where a text mentions either the abandonment only of works or\nonly their being obtained by others, both these matters must necessarily be\ncombined, since the statement as to the works being obtained forms a\nsupplement to the statement of their being abandoned. For the former statement\ndeclares the place to which the good and evil works, got rid of by him who\nknows Brahman, are transferred.--This supplementary relation of two statements\nthe Sutra illustrates by some parallel cases. A clause in the text of the _S_\na _t_ yayanins, 'the ku _s_ as are the children of the udumbara tree,' forms a\ndefining supplement to a more general statement in the text of the\nKaushitakins, 'the ku _s_ as are the children of the tree.' The clause, 'the\nmetres of the gods are prior,' defines the order of the metres which in other\ntexts mentioning 'the metres of the gods and Asuras' had been left undefined,\nand therefore forms a supplement to those texts. Analogous is the relation of\nthe clause, 'he assists the stotra of the sho _d_ a _s_ in when the sun has\nhalf risen,' to the less definite statement 'he assists with gold the stotra\nof the sho _d_ a _s_ in;' and the relation of the clause, 'the adhvaryu is not\nto sing,' to the general injunction 'all the priests join in the singing.'\nUnless we admit that one statement, which defines some other more general\nstatement, may stand to the latter in a supplementary relation, we are driven\nto assume an optional proceeding, and this is objectionable as long as there\nis any other way open; according to a principle laid down in the Purva Mima\n_m_ sa (X, 8, 15). As the clauses referring to the abandonment of the works,\nand\n\np. 648\n\nthose referring to their being taken up by others, thus form one connected\nwhole, there is no such thing as mere abandonment and mere taking up, and\nhence there can be no option between the two. That the text of the\nKaushitakins mentions both thus explains itself, on the ground that the\nseveral declarations of what is really only one and the same matter are\ndirected to different hearers.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'getting\nrid of.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 27.
