Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya continued: \'Now when that Self, having sunk into\nweakness 3, sinks, as it were, into\n\np. 174\n\nunconsciousness, then gather those senses (pra _n_ as) around him, and he,\ntaking with him those elements of light, descends into the heart When that\nperson in the eye 1 turns away, then he ceases to know any forms.\n\n2\\. \'"He has become one," they say, "he does not see 2." "He has become one,"\nthey say, "he does not smell." "He has become one," they say, "he does not\ntaste." "He has become one," they say, "he does not speak." "He has become\none," they say, "he does not hear." "He has become one," they say, "he does\nnot think." "He has become one," they say, "he does not touch." "He has become\none," they say, "he does not know." The point of his heart 3 becomes lighted\nup, and by that light the Self departs, either through the eye 4, or through\nthe skull 5, or through other places of the body. And when he thus departs,\nlife (the chief pra _n_ a) departs after him, and when life thus departs, all\nthe other\n\np. 175\n\nvital spirits (pra _n_ as) depart after it. He is conscious, and being\nconscious he follows 1 and departs.\n\n\'Then both his knowledge and his work take hold of him, and his acquaintance\nwith former things 2.\'\n\n3\\. \'And as a caterpillar, after having reached the end of a blade of grass,\nand after having made another approach (to another blade) 3, draws itself\ntogether towards it, thus does this Self, after having thrown off this body 4\nand dispelled all ignorance, and after making another approach (to another\nbody), draw himself together towards it.\n\n4\\. And as a goldsmith, taking a piece of gold, turns it into another, newer\nand more beautiful shape, so does this Self, after having thrown off this body\n\np. 176\n\nand dispelled all ignorance, make unto himself another, newer and more\nbeautiful shape, whether it be like the Fathers, or like the Gandharvas, or\nlike the Devas, or like Pra _g_ apati, or like Brahman, or like other beings.\n\n5\\. \'That Self is indeed Brahman, consisting of knowledge, mind, life, sight,\nhearing, earth, water, wind, ether, light and no light, desire and no desire,\nanger and no anger, right or wrong, and all things. Now as a man is like this\nor like that 1, according as he acts and according as he behaves, so will he\nbe:--a man of good acts will become good, a man of bad acts, bad. He becomes\npure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds.\n\n\'And here they say that a person consists of desires. And as is his desire, so\nis his will; and as is his will, so is his deed; and whatever deed he does,\nthat he will reap.\n\n6\\. \'And here there is this verse: "To whatever object a man\'s own mind is\nattached, to that he goes strenuously together with his deed; and having\nobtained the end (the last results) of whatever deed he does here on earth, he\nreturns again from that world (which is the temporary reward of his deed) to\nthis world of action."\n\n\'So much for the man who desires. But as to the man who does not desire, who,\nnot desiring, freed from desires, is satisfied in his desires, or desires the\nSelf only, his vital spirits do not depart elsewhere,--being Brahman, he goes\nto Brahman.\n\n7\\. \'On this there is this verse: "When all desires\n\np. 177\n\nwhich once entered his heart are undone, then does the mortal become immortal,\nthen he obtains Brahman.\n\n\'And as the slough of a snake lies on an ant-hill, dead and cast away, thus\nlies this body; but that disembodied immortal spirit (pra _n_ a, life) is\nBrahman only, is only light.\'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'Sir, I give you a thousand.\'\n\n8 1. \'On this there are these verses:\n\n\'The small, old path stretching far away 2 has been found by me. On it sages\nwho know Brahman move on to the Svarga-loka (heaven), and thence higher on, as\nentirely free 3.\n\n9\\. \'On that path they say that there is white, or blue, or yellow, or green,\nor red 4; that path was found by Brahman, and on it goes whoever knows\nBrahman, and who has done good, and obtained splendour.\n\n10\\. \'All who worship what is not knowledge (avidya) enter into blind\ndarkness: those who delight in knowledge, enter, as it were, into greater\ndarkness 5.\n\n11\\. \'There are 6 indeed those unblessed worlds,\n\np. 178\n\ncovered with blind darkness. Men who are ignorant and not enlightened go after\ndeath to those worlds.\n\n12\\. \'If a man understands the Self, saying, "I am He," what could he wish or\ndesire that he should pine after the body 1.\n\n13\\. \'Whoever has found and understood the Self that has entered into this\npatched-together hiding-place 2, he indeed is the creator, for he is the maker\nof everything, his is the world, and he is the world itself 3.\n\n14\\. \'While we are here, we may know this; if not, I am ignorant 4, and there\nis great destruction. Those who know it, become immortal, but others suffer\npain indeed.\n\n15\\. \'If a man clearly beholds this Self as God, and as the lord of all that\nis and will be, then he is no more afraid.\n\n16\\. \'He behind whom the year revolves with the days, him the gods worship as\nthe light of lights, as immortal time.\n\n17\\. \'He in whom the five beings 5 and the ether rest, him alone I believe to\nbe the Self,--I who\n\np. 179\n\nknow, believe him to be Brahman; I who am immortal, believe him to be\nimmortal.\n\n18\\. \'They who know the life of life, the eye of the eye, the ear of the ear,\nthe mind of the mind, they have comprehended the ancient, primeval Brahman 1.\n\n19\\. \'By the mind alone it is to be perceived 2, there is in it no diversity.\nHe who perceives therein any diversity, goes from death to death.\n\n20\\. \'This eternal being that can never be proved, is to be perceived in one\nway only; it is spotless, beyond the ether, the unborn Self, great and\neternal.\n\n21\\. \'Let a wise Brahma _n_ a, after he has discovered him, practise wisdom 3.\nLet him not seek after many words, for that is mere weariness of the tongue.\n\n22\\. \'And he is that great unborn Self, who consists of knowledge, is\nsurrounded by the Pra _n_ as, the ether within the heart 4. In it there\nreposes the ruler of all, the lord of all, the king of all. He does not become\ngreater by good works, nor smaller by evil works. He is the lord of all, the\nking of all things, the protector of all things. He is a bank 5 and a\nboundary, so that these worlds may not be confounded. Brahma _n_ as seek to\nknow him by the study of the Veda, by sacrifice, by gifts, by penance, by\nfasting, and he who knows him, becomes a Muni. Wishing for that world (for\nBrahman) only, mendicants leave their homes.\n\n\'Knowing this, the people of old did not wish for offspring. What shall we do\nwith offspring, they said,\n\np. 180\n\nwe who have this Self and this world (of Brahman) 1? And they, having risen\nabove the desire for sons, wealth, and new worlds, wander about as mendicants.\nFor desire for sons is desire for wealth, and desire for wealth is desire for\nworlds. Both these are indeed desires only. He, the Self, is to be described\nby No, no 2! He is incomprehensible, for he cannot be comprehended; he is\nimperishable, for he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not attach\nhimself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he does not fail. Him (who knows),\nthese two do not overcome, whether he says that for some reason he has done\nevil, or for some reason he has done good--he overcomes both, and neither what\nhe has done, nor what he has omitted to do, burns (affects) him.\n\n23\\. \'This has been told by a verse ( _Ri_ _k_ ): "This eternal greatness of\nthe Brahma _n_ a does not grow larger by work, nor does it grow smaller. Let\nman try to find (know) its trace, for having found (known) it, he is not\nsullied by any evil deed."\n\n\'He therefore that knows it, after having become quiet, subdued, satisfied,\npatient, and collected 3, sees self in Self, sees all as Self. Evil does not\novercome him, he overcomes all evil. Evil does not burn him, he burns all\nevil. Free from evil, free from spots, free from doubt, he becomes a (true)\nBrahma _n_ a; this is the Brahma-world, O King,\'--thus spoke Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya.\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'Sir, I give you the Videhas, and also myself, to be\ntogether your slaves.\'\n\n24\\. This 4 indeed is the great, the unborn Self, the\n\np. 181\n\nstrong 1, the giver of wealth. He who knows this obtains wealth.\n\n25\\. This great, unborn Self, undecaying, undying, immortal, fearless, is\nindeed Brahman. Fearless is Brahman, and he who knows this becomes verily the\nfearless Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[173:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_505) See \xc2\xa7 17, before.\n\n[173:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_506) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara seems to take ukkhvasi as a noun. He\nwrites: yatraitad bhavati; etad iti kriyavi _s_ esha _n_ am urdhvo _kh_ _h_\nvasi yatrordhvo _k_ _kh_ vasitvam asya bhavatityartha _h_.\n\n[173:3](sbe15076.htm#fr_507) In the Kaush. Up. III, 3, we read yatraitat\npurusha arto p. 174 marishyan abalyam etya sammohati. Here abalyam should\ncertainly be ab\xc4\x83lyam, as in the commentary; but should it not be \xc4\x83b\xc4\x83lyam, as\nhere. See also B _ri_ h. Up. III, 5, 1, note.\n\n[174:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_508) _K_ akshusha purusha is explained as that portion\nof the sun which is in the eye, while it is active, but which, at the time of\ndeath, returns to the sun.\n\n[174:2](sbe15076.htm#fr_509) Ekibhavati is probably a familiar expression for\ndying, but it is here explained by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, and probably was so intended,\nas meaning that the organs of the body have become one with the Self\n(li\xe1\xb9\x85gatman). The same thoughts are found in the Kaush. Up. III, 3, pra _n_ a\nekadha bhavati.\n\n[174:3](sbe15076.htm#fr_510) The point where the na _d_ is or veins go out\nfrom the heart.\n\n[174:4](sbe15076.htm#fr_511) When his knowledge and deeds qualify him to\nproceed to the sun. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara.\n\n[174:5](sbe15076.htm#fr_512) When his knowledge and deeds qualify him to\nproceed to the Brahma-world.\n\n[175:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_513) This is an obscure passage, and the different\ntext of the Madhyandinas shows that the obscurity was felt at an early time.\nThe Madhyandinas read: Sa _m_ _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anam anvavakramati sa esha _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_\nsavi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ano bhavati. This would mean, \'Consciousness departs after. He\nthe knowing (Self) is self-conscious.\' The Ka _n_ vas read: Savi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ano\nbhavati, savi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anam evanvavakramati. Roer translates: \'It is endowed\nwith knowledge, endowed with knowledge it departs;\' and he explains, with _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara, that the knowledge here intended is such knowledge as one has in a\ndream, a knowledge of impressions referring to their respective objects, a\nknowledge which is the effect of actions, and not inherent in the self.\nDeussen translates: \'Sie (die Seele) ist von Erkenntnissart, und was von\nErkenntnissart ist, ziehet ihr nach.\' The Persian translator evidently thought\nthat self-consciousness was implied, for he writes: \'Cum quovis corpore\naddictionem sumat . . . . in illo corpore aham est, id est, ego sum.\'\n\n[175:2](sbe15076.htm#fr_514) This acquaintance with former things is necessary\nto explain the peculiar talents or deficiencies which we observe in children.\nThe three words vidya, karman, and purvapra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a often go together (see\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara on B _ri_ h. Up. IV, 3, 9). Deussen\'s conjecture, apurvapra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\na, is not called for.\n\n[175:3](sbe15076.htm#fr_515) See B _ri_ h. Up. IV, 3, 9, a passage which shows\nhow difficult it would be always to translate the same Sanskrit words by the\nsame words in English; see also Brahmopanishad, p. 245.\n\n[175:4](sbe15076.htm#fr_516) See B _ri_ h. Up. IV, 3, 9, and IV, 3, 13\n\n[176:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_517) The iti after adomaya is not clear to me, but it\nis quite clear that a new sentence begins with tadyadetat, which Regnaud, II,\np. 101 and p. 139, has not observed.\n\n[177:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_518) This may be independent matter, or may be placed\nagain into the mouth of Yag\xc3\xb1avalkya.\n\n[177:2](sbe15076.htm#fr_519) Instead of vitata _h_ , which perhaps seemed to\nbe in contradiction with anu there is a Madhyandina reading vitara, probably\nintended originally to mean leading across. The other adjective mam\xcc\x90sp _ri_ sh\n_t_ a I cannot explain. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains it by ma _m_ sp _ri_ sh _t_ a _h_\n, maya labdha _h_.\n\n[177:3](sbe15076.htm#fr_520) That this is the true meaning, is indicated by\nthe various readings of the Madhyandinas, tena dhira apiyanti brahmavida\nutkramya svarga _m_ lokam ito vimukta _h_. The road is not to lead to Svarga\nonly, but beyond.\n\n[177:4](sbe15076.htm#fr_521) See the colours of the veins as given before, IV,\n3, 20.\n\n[177:5](sbe15076.htm#fr_522) See Va _g_. Up. 9. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara in our place\nexplains avidya by works, and vidya by the Veda, excepting the Upanishads.\n\n[177:6](sbe15076.htm#fr_523) See Va _g_. Up. 3; Ka _th_ a Up. I. 3.\n\n[178:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_524) That he should be willing to suffer once more the\npains inherent in the body. The Madhyandinas read _s_ ariram anu sa _m_ karet,\ninstead of sa _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ varet.\n\n[178:2](sbe15076.htm#fr_525) The body is meant, and is called deha from the\nroot dih, to knead together. Roer gives sa _m_ dehye gahane, which _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara\nexplains by sa _m_ dehe. Poley has sa _m_ deghe, which is the right Ka _n_ va\nreading. The Madhyandinas read sa _m_ dehe. Gahane might be taken as an\nadjective also, referring to sa _m_ dehe.\n\n[178:3](sbe15076.htm#fr_526) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara takes loka, world, for atma, self.\n\n[178:4](sbe15076.htm#fr_527) I have followed _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara in translating avedi\n_h_ by ignorant, but the text seems corrupt.\n\n[178:5](sbe15076.htm#fr_528) The five _g_ anas, i.e. the Gandharvas, Pit _ri_\ns, Devas, Asuras, and Rakshas; or the four castes with the Nishadas; or\nbreath, eye, ear, food, and mind.\n\n[179:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_529) See Talavak. Up. I, 2.\n\n[179:2](sbe15076.htm#fr_530) See Ka _th_ a Up. IV, 10-11.\n\n[179:3](sbe15076.htm#fr_531) Let him practise abstinence, patience, &c., which\nare the means of knowledge.\n\n[179:4](sbe15076.htm#fr_532) See B _ri_ h. Up. IV, 3, 7.\n\n[179:5](sbe15076.htm#fr_533) See _Kh_ and. Up. VIII, 4.\n\n[180:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_534) Cf. B _ri_ h. Up. III, 5, 1.\n\n[180:2](sbe15076.htm#fr_535) See B _ri_ h. Up. III, 9, 26; IV, 2, 4.\n\n[180:3](sbe15076.htm#fr_536) See Deussen, Vedanta, p. 85.\n\n[180:4](sbe15076.htm#fr_537) As described in the dialogue between _G_ anaka\nand Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\n\n[181:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_538) Annada is here explained as \'dwelling in all\nbeings, and eating all food which they eat.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 5](sbe15077.htm)\n\n'
