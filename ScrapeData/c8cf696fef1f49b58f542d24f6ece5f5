The great contest between Karna and Arjun, long\nexpected and long deferred, came on at last. It is the crowning incident of\nthe Indian Epic, as the contest between Hector and Achilles is the crowning\nincident of the Iliad. With a truer artistic skill than that of Homer, the\nIndian poet represents Karna as equal to Arjun in strength and skill, and his\ndefeat is only due to an accident.\n\nAfter the death of Karna, Salya led the Kuru troops on the eighteenth and last\nday of the war, and fell. A midnight slaughter in the Pandav camp, perpetrated\nby the vengeful son of Drona, concludes the war. Duryodhan, left wounded by\nBhima, heard of the slaughter and died happy.\n\nBooks viii., ix., and x. of the original have been abridged in this Book.\n\n## I\n\n## KARNA AND ARJUN MEET\n\nSights of red and ghastly carnage day disclosed upon the plain,  \nMighty chiefs and countless warriors round the warlike Drona slain,\n\nSad Duryodhan gazed in sorrow and the tear was in his eye,  \nTill his glances fell on Karna and his warlike heart beat high!\n\n"Karna!" so exclaimed Duryodhan, "hero of resistless might,  \nThou alone canst serve the Kuru in this dread and dubious fight,\n\nStep forth, Kuru\'s chief and leader, mount thy sounding battle-car,  \nLead the still unconquered Kurus to the trophies of the war!\n\nMatchless was the ancient Bhishma in this famed and warlike land,  \nBut a weakness for Yudhishthir palsied Bhishma\'s slaying hand,\n\nMatchless too was doughty Drona in the warrior\'s skill and art,  \nKindness for his pupil Arjun lurked within the teacher\'s heart!\n\nGreater than the ancient grandsire, greater than the Brahman old,  \nFiercer in thy deathless hatred, stronger in thy prowess bold,\n\nPeerless Karna, lead us onward to a brighter happier fate,  \nFor thy arm is nerved to action by an unforgotten hate!\n\nLead us as the martial SKANDA led the conquering gods of old,  \nSmite the foe as angry INDRA smote the Danavs fierce and bold,\n\nAs before the light of morning flies the baleful gloom of night,  \nPandavs and the proud Panchalas fly before thy conquering might!\n\nPriests with hymns and chanted mantra and with every sacred rite  \nHailed him Leader of the Kurus, chieftain of unconquered might,\n\nEarthen jars they placed around him with the sacred water full,  \nElephant\'s tusk they laid beside him and the horn of mighty bull,\n\nGem and jewel, corn and produce, by the armed hero laid,  \nSilken cloth of finest lustre o\'er his crowned head they spread,\n\nBrahmans poured the holy water, bards his lofty praises sung,  \nKshatras, Vaisyas, purer Sudras hailed him Leader bold and strong!\n\n"Vanquish warlike sons of Pritha! " thus the holy Brahmans blessed,  \nGold and garments, food and cattle, joyous Karna on them pressed,\n\nAnd the holy rite concluded, Karna ranged his men in war,  \nTo the dreaded front of battle drove his swift and conquering car!\n\nMorn to noon and noon to evening raged the battle on the plain,  \nCountless warriors fought and perished, car-borne chiefs were pierced and\nslain,\n\nHelmed Arjun, crowned Karna, met at last by will of fate,  \nLife-long was their mutual anger, deathless was their mutual hate!\n\nAnd the firm earth shook and trembled \'neath the furious rush of war,  \nAnd the echoing welkin answered shouts that nations heard afar,\n\nAnd the thickening cloud of arrows filled the firmament on high,  \nDarker, deeper, dread and deadlier, grew the angry face of sky,\n\nTill the evening\'s sable garment mantled o\'er the battle-field,  \nAnd the angry rivals parted, neither chief could win or yield!\n\n## II\n\n## FALL OF KARNA\n\nAt the break of morning Karna unto Prince Duryodhan went,  \nThus in slow and measured accents to his inner thoughts gave vent:\n\n"Morning dawns, O Kuru\'s monarch! mighty Arjun shall be slain,  \nOr fulfilling warrior\'s duty Karna dyes the gory plain!\n\nLong through life within our bosoms ever burnt the mutual hate,  \nOft we met and often parted, rescued by the will of fate,\n\nBut yon sun with crimson lustre sees us meet to part no more,  \nGallant Arjun\'s course this evening or proud Karna\'s shall be o\'er,\n\nRoom is none for Arjun\'s glory and for archer Karna\'s fame,  \nOne must sink and one must sparkle with a brighter richer flame!\n\nList yet more; in wealth of arrows and in wondrous strength of bow,  \nArjun scarcely me surpasseth, scarcely I excel my foe,\n\nIn the light skill of the archer and in sight and truth of aim,  \nArjun beats not, scarcely rivals, Karna\'s proud and peerless fame!\n\nIf his wondrous bow _Gandiva_ is the gift of gods in heaven,  \nKarna\'s bow the famed _Vijaya_ is by Par\'su-Rama given,\n\nAy, the son of Jamadagni, kings of earth who proudly slayed,  \nOn the youthful arms of Karna his destructive weapon laid!\n\nYet I own, O king of Kuru! Arjun doth his foe excel,  \nMatchless are his fiery coursers, peerless Krishna leads them well,\n\nKrishna holds the reins for Arjun, Krishna speeds his battle-car,  \nDrives the lightning-winged coursers o\'er the startled field of war,\n\nSweeps in pride his sounding chariot till it almost seems to fly,  \nArjun lords it o\'er the battle like the comet in the sky!\n\nGrant me, monarch, mighty Salya drive my swift and warlike steed,  \nAnd against the car-borne Arjun, Karna\'s fiery chariot lead,\n\nSalya,too is skilled, like Krishna, with the steed and battle-car,  \nEqual thus I meet my foeman in this last and fatal war!"\n\nSpake Duryodhan; warlike Salya mounted Karna\'s sounding car,  \nKarna sought for mighty Arjun in the serried ranks of war:\n\n"Hundred milch-kine Karna offers, costly garment, yellow gold,  \nUnto him who in this battle points to me my foeman bold,\n\nCars and steeds and fertile acres, peaceful hamlets rich and fair,  \nDark-eyed damsels lotus-bosomed, crowned with glossy raven hair,\n\nThese are his who points out Arjun hiding from this fatal war,  \nArjun\'s snowy steeds and banner and his swift and thund\'ring car!"\n\nKarna spake, but long and loudly laughed the king of Madra\'s land,  \nAs he reined the fiery coursers with his strong and skilful hand,\n\n"Of rewards and gifts," he uttered, "little need is there, I ween,  \nArjun is not wont to tarry from the battle\'s glorious scene,\n\nSoon will Arjun\'s snowy coursers shake the battle\'s startled field,  \nHelmed Arjun like a comet gleam with bow and sword and shield!\n\nAs the forest-ranging tiger springs upon his fated prey,  \nAs the homed bull infuriate doth the weakling cattle slay,\n\nAs the fierce and lordly lion smites the timid jungle-deer,  \nArjun soon shall smite thee, Karna, for he knows nor dread nor fear,\n\nSave thee then, O mighty archer I while I drive my sounding car,  \nPandu\'s son hath met no equal in the valiant art of war!\n\nDarkly frowned the angry Karna, Salya held the loosened rein,  \nDashing through the hostile forces then the warrior sped amain,\n\nThrough the serried ranks of battle Karna drove in furious mood,  \nFacing him in royal splendour good Yudhishthir fearless stood!\n\nSurging ranks of brave Nishadas closed between and fought in vain,  \nProud Panchalas stout and faithful vainly strove among the slain,\n\nOnward came the fiery Karna like the ocean\'s heaving swell,  \nWith the sweeping wrath of tempest on the good Yudhishthir fell!\n\nWrathful then the son of Pandu marked his noblest chieftains dead,  \nAnd in words of scornful anger thus to archer Karna said:\n\n"Hast thou, Karna, vowed the slaughter of my younger Arjun brave,  \nWilt thou do Duryodhan\'s mandate, proud Duryodhan\'s willing slave,\n\nUnfulfilled thy vow remaineth, for the righteous gods ordain,  \nBy Yudhishthir\'s hand thou fallest, go and slumber with the slain!"\n\nFiercely drew his bow Yudhishthir, fiercely was the arrow driven,  \nRocky cliff or solid mountain might the shaft have pierced and riven,\n\nLightning-like it came on Karna, struck and pierced him on the left,  \nAnd the warrior fell and fainted as of life and sense bereft!\n\nSoon he rose; the cloud of anger darkened o\'er his livid face,  \nAnd he drew his godlike weapon with a more than godlike grace,\n\nArrows keen and dark as midnight gleaming in their lightning flight,  \nStruck Yudhishthir\'s royal armour with a fierce resistless might!\n\nClanking fell the shattered armour from his person fair and pale,  \nAs from sun\'s meridian splendour clouds are drifted by the gale,\n\nArmourless but bright and radiant brave Yudhishthir waged the fight,  \nBright as sky with stars bespangled on a clear and cloudless night,\n\nAnd he threw his pointed lances like the summer\'s bursting flood,  \nOnce again Yudhishthir\'s weapons drank his fiery foeman\'s blood!\n\nPale with anguish, wrathful Karna fiercely turned the tide of war,  \nOut Yudhishthir\'s royal standard, crashed his sumptuous battle-car,\n\nAnd he urged his gallant coursers till his chariot bounding flew,  \nAnd with more than godlike prowess then his famed Vijaya drew,\n\nFaint Yudhishthir sorely bleeding waged no more the fatal fight,  \nCarless, steedless, void of armour, sought his safety in his flight!\n\n"Speed, thou timid man of penance! "thus insulting Karna said,  \n"Famed for virtue not for valour! blood of thine I will not shed,\n\nSpeed and chant thy wonted mantra, do the rites that sages know,  \nBid the helmed warrior Arjun come and meet his warlike foe!"\n\nTo his tent retired Yudhishthir in his wrath and in his shame,  \nSpake to Arjun who from battle to his angry elder came:\n\n"Hast thou yet, O tardly Arjun, base insulting Karna slain,  \nKarna dealing dire destruction on this battle\'s reddened plain?\n\nLike his teacher Par\'su-Rama dyes in purple blood his course,  \nLike a snake of deathful poison Karna guards the Kuru force,\n\nKarna smote my chariot-driver and my standard rent in twain,  \nShattered car and lifeless horses strew the red inglorious plain,\n\nScarce with life in speechless anguish from the battle-field I fled,  \nScorn of foes and shame of kinsmen! Warrior\'s fame and honour dead!\n\nTen long years and three Yudhishthir joy nor peace nor rest hath seen,  \nAnd while Karna lives and glories all our insults still are green,\n\nHast thou, Arjun, slain that chieftain as in swelling pride he stood,  \nHast thou wiped our wrongs and insults in that chariot-driver\'s blood?"\n\n"At a distance," Krishna answered, "fiery Arjun fought his way,  \nNow he seeks the archer Karna and he vows his death to-day."\n\nAnger lit Yudhishthir\'s forehead and a tremor shook his frame,  \nAs he spake to silent Arjun words of insult and of shame:\n\n"Wherefore like a painted warrior doth the helmed Arjun stand,  \nWherefore useless lies Gandiva in his weak and nerveless hand,\n\nWherefore hangs yon mighty sabre from his belt of silk and gold,  \nWherefore doth the peerless Krishna drive his coursers fleet and bold,\n\nIf afar from war\'s arena timid Arjun seeks to hide,  \nIf he shuns the mighty Karna battling in unconquered pride?\n\nArjun! yield thy famed _Gandiva_ unto worthier hands than thine,  \nOn some braver, truer warrior let thy mighty standard shine,\n\nYield thy helmet and thy armour, yield thy gleaming sword and shield,  \nHide thee from this deathful battle, matchless Karna rules the field!"\n\nSparkled Arjun\'s eye in anger with a red and livid flame,  \nAnd the tempest of his passion shook his more than mortal frame.\n\nHeedless, on the sword-hilt Arjun placed his swift and trembling hand,  \nHeedless, with a warrior\'s instinct drew the dark and glistening brand!\n\nSacred blood of king and elder would have stained his trenchant steel,  \nBut the wise and noble Krishna strove the fatal feud to heal:\n\n"Not before thy elder, Arjun, but in yonder purple field,  \n\'Gainst thy rival and thy foeman use thy warlike sword and shield,\n\nRender honour to thy elder, quench thy hasty impious wrath,  \nRender faith to holy _sastra_ , leave not virtue\'s sacred path,\n\nBow before thy virtuous elder as before the gods in heaven,  \nSheathe thy sword and quell thy passion, be thy hasty sin forgiven!\n\nDuteous Arjun silent listened and obeyed the mandate high,  \nTears of manly sorrow trickled from his soft and altered eye,\n\nDear in joy and dear in suffering, calm his righteous elder stood,  \nDear in Indra-prastha\'s mansions, dearer in the jungle wood!\n\nArjun sheathed his flashing sabre, joined his hands and hung his head,  \nFixed his eye on good Yudhishthir and in humble accents said:\n\n"Pardon, great and saintly monarch, vassal\'s disrespectful word,  \nPardon, elder, if a younger heedless drew his sinful sword,\n\nBut thy best to yield my weapon stung my soul to bitter strife,  \nDearer is the bow _Gandiva_ unto Arjun than his life,\n\nPardon if the blood of anger mantled o\'er this rugged brow,  \nPardon if I drew my sabre \'gainst my duty and my vow,\n\nFor that hasty act repenting Arjun bows thy heart to move  \nGrant me, holy king and elder, monarch\'s grace and brother\'s love!"\n\nFrom Yudhishthir\'s altered eyelids gentle tears of sorrow start,  \nAnd he lifts his younger brother to his ever-loving heart:\n\n"Arjun, I have wronged thee brother, and no fault or sin is thine,  \nHasty words of thoughtless anger \'scaped these sinful lips of mine,\n\nBitter was my shame and anguish when from Karna\'s car I fled,  \nRedder than my bleeding bosom warrior\'s fame and honour bled,\n\nHasty words I uttered, Arjun, by my pain and anguish driven,  \nWipe them with a brother\'s kindness, be thy elder\'s sin forgiven!"\n\nStronger by his elder\'s blessing Arjun mounts the battle-car,  \nKrishna drives the milk-white coursers to the thickening ranks of war.\n\nOnward came the fiery Karna with his chiefs and armed men,  \nSalya urged his flying coursers with the whip and loosened rein,\n\nOften met and often parted, life-long rivals in their fame,  \nNot to part again the heroes, each before the other came,\n\nNot to part until a chieftain by the other chief was slain,  \nArjun dead or lifeless Karna, pressed the Kuru-kshetra plain!\n\nLong they strove, but neither archer could his gallant foeman beat,  \nThough like surging ocean billows did the angry warriors meet,\n\nArjun\'s arrows fell on Karna like the summer\'s angry flood,  \nKarna\'s shafts like hissing serpents drank the valiant Arjun\'s blood,\n\nFierce and quick from his Gandiva angry accents Arjun woke,  \nTill the bow-string strained and heated was by sudden impulse broke!\n\n"Hold," cried Arjun to his rival, "mind the honoured rules of war,  \nWarriors strike not helpless foemen thus disabled on the car,\n\nHold, brave Karna, until Arjun mends his over-strained bow,  \nArjun then will crave for mercy nor from god nor mortal foe!"\n\nVain he spake, for wild with anger heedless Karna, fiercely lowered,  \nThick and fast on bowless Arjun countless arrows darkly showered,\n\nLike the cobra dark and hissing Karna\'s gleaming lightning dart,  \nStruck the helpless archer Arjun on his broad and bleeding heart!\n\nFurious like a wounded tiger quivering in the darksome wood,  \nWith his mended warlike weapon now the angry Arjun stood,\n\nBlazing with a mighty radiance like a flame in summer night,  \nFierce he fell on archer Karna with his more than mortal might!\n\nLittle recked the dauntless Karna if his foe in anger rose,  \nKarna feared not face of mortal, dreaded not immortal foes,\n\nNor with all his wrath and valour Arjun conquered him in war,  \nTill within the soft earth sinking stuck the wheel of Karna\'s car!\n\nStood unmoved the tilted chariot, vainly wrathful Salya strove,  \nUrging still the struggling coursers Karna\'s heavy car to move,\n\nVainly too the gallant Karna leaped upon the humid soil,  \nSought to lift the sunken axle with a hard unwonted toil,\n\n"Hold," he cried to noble Arjun, "wage no false and impious war  \nOn a foeman, helpless, carless,--thou upon thy lofty car."\n\nLoudly laughed the helmed Arjun, answer nor rejoinder gave,  \nUnto Karna pleading virtue Krishna answered calm and grave:\n\n"Didst thou seek the path of virtue, mighty Karna, archer bold,  \nWhen Sakuni robbed Yudhishthir of his empire and his gold,\n\nDidst thou tread the path of honour on Yudhishthir\'s fatal fall,  \nHeaping insults on Draupadi in Hastina\'s council hall?\n\nDidst thou then fulfil thy duty when, Yudhishthir\'s exile crost,  \nKrishna asked in right and justice for Yudhishthir\'s empire lost,\n\nDidst thou fight a holy battle when with six marauders skilled,  \nKarna hunted Abhimanyu and the youthful hero killed?\n\nSpeak not then of rules of honour, blackened in your sins you die,  \nDeath is come in shape of Arjun, Karna\'s fatal hour is nigh!\n\nStung to fury and to madness, faint but frantic Karna fought,  \nReckless, ruthless, and relentless, valiant Arjun\'s life he sought,\n\nSent his last resistless arrow on his foeman\'s mighty chest,  \nArjun felt a shock of thunder on his broad and mailed breast!\n\nFainting fell the bleeding Arjun, darkness dimmed his manly eye,  \nPale and breathless watched his warriors, anxious watched the gods in sky,\n\nThen it passed, and helmed Arjun rose like newly lighted fire,  \nAbhimanyu\'s sad remembrance kindled fresh a father\'s ire!\n\nAnd he drew his bow _Gandiva_ , aimed his dart with stifled breath,  \nVengeance for his murdered hero winged the fatal dart of death,\n\nLike the fiery bolt of lightning Arjun\'s lurid arrow sped,  \nLike a rock by thunder riven Karna fell among the dead!\n\n## III\n\n## FALL OF SALYA\n\nDarkly closed the shades of midnight, Karna still and lifeless lay,  \nGhast and Pale o\'er slaughtered thousands fell the morning\'s sickly ray,\n\nBowman brave and proud preceptor Kripa to Duryodhan said,  \nTear bedimmed the warrior\'s eyelids and his manly bosom bled:\n\n"Leaderless are Koru\'s forces by a dire misfortune crost,  \nLike the moonless shades of midnight in their utter darkness lost,\n\nLike a summer-dried river, weary waste of and sand,  \nLost its pride of fresh\'ning waters sweeping o\'er the grateful land!\n\nAs a spark of fire consumeth summer\'s parched and sapless wood,  \nKuru\'s lordless, lifeless forces shall be angry Arjun\'s food,\n\nBhima too shall seek fulfilment of the dreadful vow he made,  \nBrave Satyaki wreak his vengeance for his sons untimely slayed!\n\nBid this battle cease, Duryodhan, pale and fitful is thy star,  \nBlood enough of friendly nations soaks this crimson field of war,\n\nBid them live,--the few survivors of a vast and countless host,  \nLet thy few remaining brothers live,--for many are the lost,\n\nKindly heart hath good Yudhishthir, still he seeks for rightful peace,  \nRender back his ancient kingdom, bid this war of kinsmen cease!"\n\n"Kripa," so Duryodhan answered, "in this sad and fatal strife,  \nEver foremost of our warriors, ever careless of thy life,\n\nEver in the council chamber thou hast words of wisdom said,  \nNeedless war and dire destruction by thy peaceful counsel stayed,\n\nEvery word thou speakest, Kripa, is a word of truth and weight.  \nNathless thy advice for concord, wise preceptor, comes too late!\n\nHope not that the good Yudhishthir will again our friendship own  \nCheated once by deep Sakuni of his kingdom and his throne,\n\nRugged Bhima will not palter, fatal is the vow he made,  \nVengeful Arjun will not pardon gallant Abhimanyu dead!\n\nFair Draupadi doth her penance, so our ancient matrons say,  \nIn our blood to wash her insult and her proud insulters slay,\n\nFair Subhadra morn and evening weeps her dear departed son,  \nFeeds Draupadi\'s deathless anger for the hero dead and gone,\n\nDeeply in their bosoms rankle wrongs and insults we have given,  \nBlood alone can wash it, Kripa, such the cruel will of Heaven!\n\nAnd the hour for peace is over, for our best sleep on the plain,  \nBrothers, kinsmen, friends, and elders slumber with the countless slain,\n\nShall Duryodhan like a recreant now avoid the deathful strife,  \nAfter all his bravest warriors have in war surrendered life,\n\nShall he, sending them to slaughter, now survive and learn to flee,  \nShall he, ruler over monarchs, learn to bend the servile knee?\n\nProud Duryodhan sues no favour even with his dying breath,  \nUnsubdued and still unconquered, changeless even unto death,\n\nSalya valiant king of Madra. leads our armed hosts to-day,  \nOr to perish or to conquer, gallant Kripa, lead the way!"\n\nMeanwhile round the brave Yudhishthir calmly stood the Pandav force,  \nAs the final day of battle now began its fatal course,\n\n"Brothers, kinsmen, hero-warriors," so the good Yudhishthir said,  \n"Ye have done your share in battle, witness countless foemen dead\n\nSad Yudhishthir is your eldest, let him end this fatal strife,  \nSlay the last of Kuru chieftains or surrender throne and life!\n\nBold Satyaki ever faithful with his arms protects my right,  \nDrupad\'s son with watchful valour guards my left with wonted might.\n\nIn the front doth Bhima battle, careful Arjun guards the rear,  \nI will lead the battle\'s centre which shall know nor flight nor fear!"\n\nTruly on that fatal morning brave Yudhishthir kept his word,  \nLong and fiercely waged the combat with fair Madra\'s valiant lord,\n\nThick and fast the arrows whistled and the lances pointed well,  \nTill with crashing sound of thunder Salya\'s mighty standard fell!\n\nRescued by the son of Drona, Salya rushed again to war,  \nSlew the noble milk-white coursers of Yudhishthir\'s royal car,\n\nAnd as springs the hungry lion on the spotted jungle-deer,  \nSalya rushed upon Yudhishthir reckless and unknown to fear!\n\nBrave Yudhishthir marked him coming and he hurled his fatal dart,  \nLike the fatal curse of Brahman sank the weapon in his heart,\n\nBlood suffused his eye and nostril, quivered still his feeble hand,  \nLike a cliff by thunder riven Salya fell and shook the land!\n\nEnded was the fatal battle, for the _Mlechcha_ king was slain,  \nPierced by angry Sahadeva false Sakuni pressed the plain,\n\nAll the brothers of Duryodhan tiger-waisted Bhima slew,  \nProud Duryodhan pale and panting from the field of battle flew!\n\n## IV\n\n## NIGHT OF SLAUGHTER: DURYODHAN\'S DEATH\n\nFar from battle\'s toil and slaughter, by a dark and limpid lake,  \nSad and slow and faint Duryodhan did his humble shelter take,\n\nBut the valiant sons of Pandu with the hunter\'s watchful care,  \nThither tracked their fallen foeman like a wild beast in its lair!\n\n"Gods be witness," said Duryodhan, flaming in his shame and wrath,  \n"Boy to manhood ever hating we have crossed each other\'s path,\n\nNow we meet to part no longer, proud Duryodhan fights you all,  \nPerish he, or sons of Pandu, may this evening see your fall!"\n\nBhima answered: "For the insults long endured but not forgiven,  \nMe alone you fight, Duryodhan, witness righteous gods in heaven,\n\nCall to mind the dark destruction planned of old in fiendish ire,  \nIn the halls of Varnavata to consume us in the fire,\n\nCall to mind the scheme deceitful, deep Sakuni\'s dark device,  \nCheating us of fame and empire by the trick of loaded dice,\n\nCall to mind that coward insult and the outrage foul and keen,  \nFlung on Drupad\'s saintly daughter and our noble spotless queen,\n\nCall to mind the stainless Bhishma for thy sins and folly slain,  \nLifeless proud preceptor Drona, Karna lifeless on the plain,\n\nPerish in thy sins, Duryodhan, perish too thy hated name,  \nAnd thy dark life crime-polluted ends, Duryodhan, in thy shame!"\n\nLike two bulls that fight in fury blind with wounds and oozing blood,  \nLike two wild and warring tuskers shaking all the echoing wood,\n\nMe the thunder-wielding INDRA, YAMA monarch of the dead,  \nDauntless Bhima and Duryodhan fiercely strove and fought and bled!\n\nSparks of fire shot from their maces and their faces ran with blood,  \nNeither won and neither yielded, matched in strength the rivals stood,\n\nTill his vow remembered Bhima, and he raised his weapon high,  \nWith a foul attack but fatal broke Duryodhan\'s shattered knee!\n\nThrough the sky a voice resounded as the great Duryodhan fell,  \nAnd the earth the voice re-echoed o\'er her distant hill and dale,\n\nBeasts and birds in consternation flew o\'er land and azure sky,  \nMen below and heavenly _Siddhas_ trembled at the fatal cry!\n\nDarkness fell upon the battle, proud Duryodhan dying lay,  \nBut the slaughter of the combat closed not with the closing day,\n\nAncient feud and hatred linger after battle\'s sweeping flood,  \nAnd the father\'s deathless anger courseth in the children\'s blood,\n\nDrona slept and gallant Drupad, for their earthly task was done,  \nVengeance fired the son of Drona \'gainst the royal Drupad\'s son!\n\nSable shadows of the midnight fell o\'er battle\'s silent plain,  \nFaintly shone the fitful planets on the dying and the slain,\n\nAnd the vengeful son of Drona fired by omens dark and dread,  \nStole into the tents of foemen with a soft and noiseless tread!\n\nDhrista-dyumna and Sikhandin, princes of Panchala\'s land,  \nFell beneath the proud avenger Aswa-thaman\'s reeking hand,\n\nAy, where Drupad\'s sleeping grandsons, fair Draupadi\'s children lay,  \nStole the cruel arm of vengeance, smothered them ere dawn of day!\n\nDone the ghastly work of slaughter, Aswa-thaman bent his way  \nWhere beside the limpid waters lone Duryodhan dying lay,\n\nAnd Duryodhan blessed the hero with his feeble fleeting breath,  \nJoy of vengeance cheered his bosom and he died a happy death!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XI: Funeral
