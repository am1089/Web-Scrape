If it be said that (the passage does) not (refer to Brahman) on account of\nthe smallness of the abode (mentioned), and on account of the denotations of\nthat (i.e. of minuteness); we say, no; because (Brahman) has thus to be\ncontemplated, and because the case is analogous to that of ether.\n\nOn account of the limitation of its abode, which is mentioned in the clause,\n'He is my Self within the heart,' and on account of the declaration as to its\nminuteness contained in the direct statement, 'He is smaller than a grain of\nrice,' &c.; the embodied soul only, which is of the size of an awl's point, is\nspoken of in the passage under discussion, and not\n\np. 114\n\nthe highest Self. This assertion made above (in the purvapaksha of Sutra I,\nand restated in the purvapaksha of the present Sutra) has to be refuted. We\ntherefore maintain that the objection raised does not invalidate our view of\nthe passage. It is true that a thing occupying a limited space only cannot in\nany way be spoken of as omnipresent; but, on the other hand, that which is\nomnipresent, and therefore in all places may, from a certain point of view, be\nsaid to occupy a limited space. Similarly, a prince may be called the ruler of\nAyodhya although he is at the same time the ruler of the whole earth.--But\nfrom what point of view can the omnipresent Lord be said to occupy a limited\nspace and to be minute?--He may, we reply, be spoken of thus, 'because he is\nto be contemplated thus.' The passage under discussion teaches us to\ncontemplate the Lord as abiding within the lotus of the heart, characterised\nby minuteness and similar qualities--which apprehension of the Lord is\nrendered possible through a modification of the mind--just as Hari is\ncontemplated in the sacred stone called _S_ alagram. Although present\neverywhere, the Lord is pleased when meditated upon as dwelling in the heart.\nThe case is, moreover, to be viewed as analogous to that of the ether. The\nether, although all-pervading, is spoken of as limited and minute, if\nconsidered in its connexion with the eye of a needle; so Brahman also. But it\nis an understood matter that the attributes of limitation of abode and of\nminuteness depend, in Brahman's case, entirely on special forms of\ncontemplation, and are not real. The latter consideration disposes also of the\nobjection, that if Brahman has its abode in the heart, which heart-abode is a\ndifferent one in each body, it would follow that it is affected by all the\nimperfections which attach to beings having different abodes, such as parrots\nshut up in different cages, viz. want of unity, being made up of parts, non-\npermanency, and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 8](sbe34045.htm)\n\n"
