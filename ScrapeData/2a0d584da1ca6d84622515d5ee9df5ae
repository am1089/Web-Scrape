Next follows Kutsayana's hymn of praise:\n\n'Thou art Brahma, and thou art Vish _n_ u, thou art Rudra, thou Pra _g_ apati\n2, thou art Agni, Varu _n_ a, Vayu, thou art Indra, thou the Moon.\n\nThou art Anna 3 (the food or the eater), thou art Yama, thou art the Earth,\nthou art All, thou art the Imperishable. In thee all things exist in many\nforms, whether for their natural or for their own (higher) ends.\n\nLord of the Universe, glory to thee! Thou art the Self of All, thou art the\nmaker of All, the enjoyer of All; thou art all life, and the lord of all\npleasure and joy 4. Glory to thee, the tranquil, the deeply hidden, the\nincomprehensible, the immeasurable, without beginning and without end.'\n\n__________________\n\n2\\. 'In the beginning 5 darkness (tamas) alone was this. It was in the\nHighest, and, moved by the Highest, it becomes uneven. Thus it becomes\nobscurity\n\np. 304\n\n(ra _g_ as) 1. Then this obscurity, being moved, becomes uneven. Thus it\nbecomes goodness (sattva). Then this goodness, being moved, the essence flowed\nforth 2. This is that part (or state of Self) which is entirely intelligent,\nreflected in man (as the sun is in different vessels of water) knowing the\nbody (kshetra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a), attested by his conceiving, willing, and believing,\nit is Pra _g_ apati, called Vi _s_ va. His manifestations have been declared\nbefore 3. Now that part of him which belongs to darkness, that, O students 4,\nis he who is called Rudra. That part of him which belongs to obscurity, that,\nO students, is he who is called Brahma. That part of him which belongs to\ngoodness, that, O students, is he who is called Vish _n_ u. He being one,\nbecomes three, becomes eight 5, becomes eleven 6, becomes twelve, becomes\ninfinite. Because 7 he thus came to be, he is the Being (neut.), he moves\nabout, having entered all beings, he has become the Lord of all beings. He is\nthe Self within and without, yes, within and without.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[303:1](sbe15116.htm#fr_1026) At the beginning of the fifth Prapa _th_ aka my\nMS. gives the _S_ lokas which in the printed edition are found in VI, 34, p.\n178, Atreme _s_ loka bhavanti, yatha nirindhano vahnir, &c., to nirvishaya _m_\nsm _ri_ tam. Then follows as \xc2\xa7 2, Atha yatheda _m_ Kautsyayanistutis, tvam,\n&c.\n\n[303:2](sbe15116.htm#fr_1027) The commentator explains Brahma by Hira _n_\nyagarbha and Pra _g_ apati by Vira _g_.\n\n[303:3](sbe15116.htm#fr_1028) M. reads tvam Manus, tva _m_ Yama _s_ _k_ a\ntvam, p _ri_ thivi tvam atha _k_ yuta _h_ , which is so clearly the right\nreading that it is difficult to understand how the mistakes arose which are\npresupposed by the commentary. See Taitt. Up. II, 2.\n\n[303:4](sbe15116.htm#fr_1029) M. reads vi _s_ vakri _d_ arati _h_ prabhu _h_ ,\nwhich seems better.\n\n[303:5](sbe15116.htm#fr_1030) M. reads tamo va idam ekam asta tat paro syat\ntat pare _n_ eritam. It may have been tat pare 'sthat.\n\n[304:1](sbe15116.htm#fr_1031) M. reads etad vai ra _g_ aso rupam, which is\nbetter, or, at least, more in accordance with what follows.\n\n[304:2](sbe15116.htm#fr_1032) M. reads sattvam everitarasas sa _m_ pras _ri_\nvat.\n\n[304:3](sbe15116.htm#fr_1033) A reference to Maitr. Up. II, 5, would have\nsaved the commentator much trouble. M. has a better text. It leaves out vi _s_\nveti or vi _s_ vakhyas after pra _g_ apati, which may be wrong, but then goes\non: tasya prokta agryas tanavo brahma rudro vish _n_ ur iti. In enumerating\nthe three agryas tanava _h_ , however, M. is less consistent, for it begins\nwith ra _g_ as or Brahma, then goes on to tamas or Rudra, and ends with sattva\nor Vish _n_ u. The Anubhutiprakasa, verse 142, has the right succession.\n\n[304:4](sbe15116.htm#fr_1034) This vocative, brahma _k_ arino, is always left\nout in M.\n\n[304:5](sbe15116.htm#fr_1035) The five pra _n_ as, the sun, moon, and\nasterisms.\n\n[304:6](sbe15116.htm#fr_1036) The eleven organs of sense and action, which, by\ndividing manas and buddhi, become twelve.\n\n[304:7](sbe15116.htm#fr_1037) M. reads aparimitadha _k_ odbhutatvad bhuteshu\n_k_ arati pravish _t_ a _h_ sarvabhutanam.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sixth Prapathaka](sbe15117.htm)\n\n"
