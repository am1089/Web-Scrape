The Padma Puran\xcc\x81a\n\np. xviii\n\n2\\. Padma Puran\xcc\x81a. "That which contains an account of the period when the\nworld was a golden lotus (padma), and of all the occurrences of that time, is\ntherefore called the Padma by the wise: it contains fifty-five thousand\nstanzas 37." The second Puran\xcc\x81a in the usual lists is always the Padma, a very\nvoluminous work, containing, according to its own statement, as well as that\nof other authorities, fifty-five thousand slokas; an amount not far from the\ntruth. These are divided amongst five books, or Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as; 1. the Srisht\xcc\x81i\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, or section on creation; 2. the Bhumi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, description of the\nearth; 3. the Swarga Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, chapter on heaven; 4. Patala Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, chapter\non the regions below the earth; and 5. the Uttara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, last or\nsupplementary chapter. There is also current a sixth division, the Kriya Yoga\nSara, a treatise on the practice of devotion.\n\nThe denominations of these divisions of the Padma P. convey but an imperfect\nand partial notion of their contents. In the first, or section which treats of\ncreation, the narrator is Ugra\xc5\x9bravas the Suta, the son of Lomaharshan\xcc\x81a, who\nis sent by his father to the Rishis at Naimisharan\xcc\x81ya to communicate to them\nthe Puran\xcc\x81a, which, from its containing an account of the lotus (padma), in\nwhich Brahma appeared at creation, is termed the Padma or Padma Puran\xcc\x81a. The\nSuta repeats what was originally communicated by Brahma to Pulastya, and by\nhim to Bhishma. The early chapters narrate the cosmogony, and the genealogy of\nthe patriarchal families, much in the same style, and often in the same words,\nas the Vishn\xcc\x81u; and short accounts of the Manwantaras and regal dynasties: but\nthese, which are legitimate Pauran\xcc\x81ik matters, soon make way for new and\nunauthentic inventions, illustrative of the virtues of the lake of Pushkara,\nor Pokher in Ajmir, as a place of pilgrimage.\n\nThe Bhumi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, or section of the earth, defers any description of the\nearth until near its close, filling up one hundred and twenty-seven chapters\nwith legends of a very mixed description, some ancient and common to other\nPuran\xcc\x81as, but the greater part peculiar to itself, illustrative of Tirthas\neither figuratively so termed--as a wife, a parent, or a\n\np. xix\n\n[paragraph continues] Guru, considered as a sacred object--or places to which\nactual pilgrimage should be performed.\n\nThe Swarga Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a describes in the first chapters the relative positions of\nthe Lokas or spheres above the earth, placing above all Vaikun\xcc\x81tha, the sphere\nof Vishn\xcc\x81u; an addition which is not warranted by what appears to be the\noldest cosmology 38. Miscellaneous notices of some of the most celebrated\nprinces then succeed, conformably to the usual narratives; and these are\nfollowed by rules of conduct for the several castes, and at different stages\nof life. The rest of the book is occupied by legends of a diversified\ndescription, introduced without much method or contrivance; a few of which, as\nDaksha\'s sacrifice, are of ancient date, but of which the most are original\nand modern.\n\nThe Patala Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a devotes a brief introduction to the description of Patala,\nthe regions of the snake-gods; but the name of Rama having been mentioned,\n\xc5\x9aesha, who has succeeded Pulastya as spokesman, proceeds to narrate the\nhistory of Rama, his descent and his posterity; in which the compiler seems to\nhave taken the poem of Kalida\xc5\x9ba, the Raghu Van\xc5\x9ba, for his chief authority. An\noriginality of addition may be suspected, however, in the adventures of the\nhorse destined by Rama for an A\xc5\x9bwamedha, which form the subject of a great\nmany chapters. When about to be sacrificed, the horse turns out to be a\nBrahman, condemned by an imprecation of Durvasas, a sage, to assume the equine\nnature, and who, by having been sanctified by connexion with Rama, is released\nfrom his metamorphosis, and dispatched as a spirit of light to heaven. This\npiece of Vaishn\xcc\x81ava fiction is followed by praises of the \xc5\x9ari Bhagavata, an\naccount of Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s juvenilities, and the merits of worshipping Vishn\xcc\x81u.\nThese accounts are communicated through a machinery borrowed from the Tantras:\nthey are told by Sada\xc5\x9biva to Parvati, the ordinary interlocutors of Tantrika\ncompositions.\n\nThe Uttara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a is a most voluminous aggregation of very heterogeneous\nmatters, but it is consistent in adopting a decidedly Vaishn\xcc\x81ava tone, and\nadmitting no compromise with any other form of faith. The chief subjects are\nfirst discussed in a dialogue between king Dilipa and\n\np. xx\n\nthe Muni Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha; such as the merits of bathing in the month of Magha, and\nthe potency of the Mantra or prayer addressed to Lakshmi Narayan\xcc\x81a. But the\nnature of Bhakti, faith in Vishn\xcc\x81u--the use of Vaishn\xcc\x81ava marks on the body--\nthe legends of Vishn\xcc\x81u\'s Avataras, and especially of Rama--and the\nconstruction of images of Vishn\xcc\x81u--are too important to be left to mortal\ndiscretion: they are explained by \xc5\x9aiva to Parvati, and wound up by the\nadoration of Vishn\xcc\x81u by those divinities. The dialogue then reverts to the\nking and the sage; and the latter states why Vishn\xcc\x81u is the only one of the\ntriad entitled to respect; \xc5\x9aiva being licentious, Brahma arrogant, and Vishn\xcc\x81u\nalone pure. Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha then repeats, after \xc5\x9aiva, the Mahatmya of the Bhagavad\nGita; the merit of each book of which is illustrated by legends of the good\nconsequences to individuals from perusing or hearing it. Other Vaishn\xcc\x81ava\nMahatmyas occupy considerable portions of this Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, especially the\nKartika Mahatmya, or holiness of the month Kartika, illustrated as usual by\nstories, a few of which are of an early origin, but the greater part modern,\nand peculiar to this Puran\xcc\x81a 39.\n\nThe Kriya Yoga Sara is repeated by Suta to the Rishis, after Vyasa\'s\ncommunication of it to Jaimini, in answer to an inquiry how religious merit\nmight be secured in the Kali age, in which men have become incapable of the\npenances and abstraction by which final liberation was formerly to be\nattained. The answer is, of course, that which is intimated in the last hook\nof the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a--personal devotion to Vishn\xcc\x81u: thinking of him,\nrepeating his names, wearing his marks, worshipping in his temples, are a full\nsubstitute for all other acts of moral or devotional or contemplative merit.\n\nThe different portions of the Padma Puran\xcc\x81a are in all probability as many\ndifferent works, neither of which approaches to the original definition of a\nPuran\xcc\x81a. There may be some connexion between the three first portions, at\nleast as to time; but there is no reason to consider them as of high\nantiquity. They specify the Jains both by name and practices.; they talk of\nMlechchhas, \'barbarians,\' flourishing in India; they commend\n\np. xxi\n\nthe use of the frontal and other Vaishn\xcc\x81ava marks; and they notice other\nsubjects which, like these, are of no remote origin. The Patala Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a\ndwells copiously upon the Bhagavata, and is consequently posterior to it. The\nUttara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a is intolerantly Vaishn\xcc\x81ava, and is therefore unquestionably\nmodern. It enjoins the veneration of the Salagram stone and Tulasi plant, the\nuse of the Tapta-mudra, or stamping with a hot iron the name of Vishn\xcc\x81u on the\nskin, and a variety of practices and observances undoubtedly no part of the\noriginal system. It speaks of the shrines of \xc5\x9ari-rangam and Venkatadri in the\nDekhin, temples that have no pretension to remote antiquity; and it names\nHaripur on the Tungabhadra, which is in all likelihood the city of\nVijayanagar, founded in the middle of the fourteenth century. The Kriya Yoga\nSara is equally a modern, and apparently a Bengali composition. No portion of\nthe Padma Puran\xcc\x81a is probably older than the twelfth century, and the last\nparts may be as recent as the fifteenth or sixteenth 40.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xviii:37](vp006.htm#fr_36) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_01800.jpg)\n\n[xix:38](vp006.htm#fr_37) See .\n\n[xx:39](vp006.htm#fr_38) One of them, the story of Jalandhara is translated by\nCol.
