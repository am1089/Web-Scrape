Brahma said :-- O Narada! Thus speaking, Vi _sn_ u stopped; Sankara, the\nDestroyer, then stepped in and, bowing down to the Devi said :--\n\n\n\n2\\. S\xc2\x92iva said :-- O Devi! If Hari be born by Thy power and the lotus-born\nBrahma have come into existence from Thee, why, then, I who of Tamo Gu _n_ a\nbe not born of Thee! O Auspicious One! Thou art clever in creating all the\nLokas! What wonder is there in My being created by Thee.\n\n\n\n3\\. O Mother! Thou art the earth, water, air, akasa and fire. Thou art, again,\nthe organs of senses and the organs of perception; Thou art Buddhi, mind and\nAhankara (egoism).\n\n\n\n4\\. Those who say that Hari, Hara, and Brahma are respectively the Preserver,\nthe Destroyer and the Creator of this whole Universe do know anything. All the\nthree, above mentioned, are created by Thee; then they perform always their\nrespective functions; their sole refuge being Thyself.\n\n\n\n5\\. O Mother! If the Universe be created of the five elements, earth, air,\nether, fire, and water, having the properties of touch, taste, etc., then how\nthese five elements possessing attributes and of the nature of effects, can\ncome into manifestation, without their being born from Thy Chit portion\n(Intelligence)?\n\n\n\np. 132\n\n\n\n6\\. O Auspicious Mother! It is Thou in the shape of Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and\nS\xc2\x92iva, That art creating this Universe and it is Thou that hast assumed the\nform of this whole Universe, moving and non-moving. Thus Thou playest, as it\nwills Thee, under various forms, again and again. Thou dost cease from play\n(during pralaya) as it likes Thee.\n\n\n\n7\\. O Mother! When Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and I become desirous to create the\nworld, we execute our duties by taking the dust (earth, etc.) of Thy lotus\nfeet.\n\n\n\n8\\. O Mother! It it were not Thy mercy, then how Brahma could have become\nendowed with Rajogu _n_ a, Vi _sn_ u with Sattvagu _n_ a and I with Tamogu _n_\na?\n\n\n\n9\\. O Mother! If there were no differences observed in Thy mind, then why hast\nThou created in this world rich and poor, king and councillors, servants,\netc., various classes of beings? Why hast Thou not created all alike happy or\nall alike miserable?\n\n\n\n10\\. So Thou wilt have to show Thy mercy towards me. Thy three gu _n_ as are\ncapable at all times to create, preserve and destroy the world; then Hari,\nHara and Brahma, whom Thou hast created as the cause of the three worlds, is\nsimply Thy will.\n\n\n\n11-12. O Bhavani! If Thy Gu _n_ as had no power in the acts of creation, etc.,\nthen how can the fact that while we three Hari, Brahma and I were coming in\nthe aeroplane, we saw on our way new worlds created by Thee, become possible?\nKindly dost Thou say on this. O World-Mother! It is Thou that desirest to\ncreate, preserve, and destroy this world by Thy part Mayik power. Thou art\nalways enjoying with Puru _s_ a, Thy husband. O S\xc2\x92iva! We cannot fathom Thy\ninscrutable ways.\n\n\n\n13-15. O auspicious one! How can we understand Thy sport? O Mother! We are\ntransformed into young women before Thee; let us serve Thy lotus feet. If we\nget our manhood, we will be deprived from serving Thy feet and thus of the\ngreatest happiness. O Mother! O Sire! I do not like to leave Thy lotus feet\nand get my man-body again and reign in the three worlds. O Beautiful faced\none! Now that I have got this youthful feminine form before Thee, there is not\na trace of desire within me to get again my masculine form. What use is there\nin getting manhood, what happiness is there if I do not get sight of Thy\nlotus-feet!\n\n\n\n16-18. O Mother! Let this unsullied fame of mine be spread over in the three\nworlds that I have got, in this young womanly form, the chance of serving Thy\nlotus feet that has got this effect that the idea of world goes away. Who is\nthere that will leave Thy service and desire to enjoy the foeless kingdom in\nthe world? Oh! even a moment appears a Yuga to him who has not got Thy lotus\nfeet with him! O Mother! Those that\n\n\n\np. 133\n\n\n\nleave the worship of Thy lotus feet and become engaged in performing tapasya\nare certainly deprived of the best thing by the Creator, though their minds be\npure and holy. Their power from their Tapasya may be acquired and they be\nentitled for Mukti; yet they get dire defeat from not having Thee.\n\n\n\n19\\. O Unborn One! Austerities, control of passions, enlightenment or\nperformance of sacrifices, as ordained in the Vedas, nothing can save, from\nthis ocean of Samsara. It is the devotional worship only of Thy lotus feet\nthat can make one attain the Beatitude. O Devi! If Thou be extremely merciful\ntowards me, then initiate me in that wonderful holy mantra of Thine; I will\nrepeat that omnipotent par-excellent nine-lettered mantra of the Chandika Devi\nand be happy.\n\n\n\n20-26. O Mother! In my former birth I got the nine-lettered mantra but now I\nhave forgotten it O Tari _n_ i! O Saviour! Give me today that mantra and save\nme from this ocean of world. Brahma said :-- When S\xc2\x92iva of wonderful fire and\nenergy, said this, the Devi Ambika clearly uttered the nine lettered mantra.\nMahadeva accepted the mantra and became very glad. He fell down at the feet of\nthe Devi, and then and there began to repeat the nine-lettered mantra together\nwith Vija (seed) that yields desires and liberation and can be easily\npronounced. When I saw S'ankara, the Auspicious One to all the Lokas, in that\nstate, I fell down also at the feet of the Devi and spoke to Maha Maya :-- O\nMother! It is not that the Vedas are unable to ascertain Thy nature; for, in\nthe performances of sacrifices and other minor actions, they do not mention\nThy full Nature, the Ordainer of all but mention simply Indra and minor\ndeities and Svaha Devi, a portion of Thy essence as the presiding deities of\nthe sacrificial offerings and oblations. So, O Devi! It is Thou that hast been\nextolled in this Universe as the Universal Consciousness, all knowing and\ntranscending all the Devas and all the Lokas.\n\n\n\nNote :-- The nine lettered mantra is \xc2\x93Om Hrim S'rim Chan _d_ ikayai nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n27\\. I have created this greatly wondrous Universe; I am the Lord of this\nBrahman _d_ a. Who is there more powerful than me in these three worlds? When\nI am Brahma, transcending all the Lokas, then I am blessed; there is no doubt\nin this. By reason of this vanity I am plunged in this widely extended ocean\nof Samsara.\n\n\n\n28-31. That now I have been able to get the dust of Thy lotus feet, has now\nmade me really proud; and truly I am blessed today and by Thy grace this\nmanifestation of pride on my part has become quite justified. Thou destroyest\nthe fear of this Samsara and givest Mukti. So, O Goddess! pray unto Thee that\nThou dost cut asunder this iron chain of my delusion,\n\n\n\np. 134\n\n\n\nfull of great troubles and make me devoted to Thee. O Auspicious One! I am\nborn from the lotus discovered by Thee; now I am extremely anxious how I can\nget Mukti. I am Thy obedient servant; I am merged in the delusion of this\nocean of world. Save me O S\xc2\x92iva! from this Samsara. Those who do not know Thy\ncharacter, think that I am the Creator and Lord of this Universe; those, who\ndo not worship Thee and worship Indra and other Devas and perform sacrifices\nto attain Heaven are certainly ignorant of Thy glory. O Prime Maya! Thou art\nthe Eternal Maha Maya! It is Thou that dost want to play this worldplay, and\nfor that purpose hast created me as Brahma. Then I created these four sorts of\nbeings, engendered by heat and moisture (said of insects and worms), those\nthat are oviparous, those that are sprung from germs or shoots, and those that\nare born from womb, viviparous and exhibit my pride \xc2\x93That I am omniscient\xc2\x94 So\nforgive this sin of mine, this my pride.\n\n\n\n32-37. O Mother ! Those ignorant persons blinded by passion, who take recourse\nto the eight-fold Yoga and Samadhi and labour under it, do not know for\ncertain, they would get Mok _s_ a, if they utter Thy name, even under a\npretext. O Bhavani! are they not deluded by error and blinded by passion for\nthis world, who discriminate only the Tattvas (essences) and forget Thy name?\nFor it is Thou that dost give Mukti from this world. O Thou Unborn! Can Hari,\nHara, etc., and other ancient persons who have realised the highest Truth,\nforget, even for a second Thy holy character and Thy names S\xc2\x92iva, Ambika,\nS'akti, Isvari and others? Canst Thou not create, by Thy glance merely, this\nfourfold creation? In fact, for mere recreation and will, it is Thou that hast\nmade me as a Creator from the earliest times. Is it not that Thou didst save\nHari in the ocean from the two Daityas Madhu and Kaitabha? Is it not again the\nfact that Thou destroyest Hara even who is the great destroyer, when Thou\ndissolvest the creation? Otherwise why is it that Hara becomes born from my\neye-brows at the time of fresh creation? So Hari is not the Preserver of all.\nHara is not the Destroyer of all. Had they been such, why would they be\npreserved and destroyed respectively by Thee? So Thou alone art the Creatrix\nand Preservatrix of all. O Bhavani; no one has heard of or seen Thee taking\nbirth; nobody knows whence Thou art born. Thou art, indeed, the One and only\nS'akti! Only the four Vedas can make one understand Thy Nature. O Mother! It\nis only by Thy help that I am able to create this creation; Hari, to preserve;\nand Hara, to destroy.\n\n\n\nWithout Thy aid, we are able to do nothing. There is nobody, in this world,\nborn or that was born or that will be born, who does not become doubtful as we\nare. This Thine wondrously variegated Universe, full of Thy Lila, consisting\nin variety, is the common ground of dispute of the imperfect intellects; who\nare not deluded here! In this Samsara, full\n\n\n\np. 135\n\n\n\nof things, visible and invisible, there is another one who is more ancient\nthan Thee; there is another Highest Person who is Thy substratum. If it be\nargued nicely, it will be seen that there is no other third Person that can be\nproved as far as evidences or proofs go to measure it. The wise persons,\nknowing all the laws, declare that there is the One God attributeless,\ninactive, without any object in view, without any upadhis or adjunct without\nany parts, who is the witness of Thy widely extended Leela \xc2\x93One alone exists;\nand that is Brahman, and there is nothing else.\xc2\x94 This is the saying of the\nVedas. Now I feel in my mind a doubt as to the discrepancy with this Veda\nsaying. I cannot say that the Veda is false. So I ask Thee :-- Art Thou the\nBrahman, the one and the secondless that is mentioned in the Vedas? or Is the\nother Person Brahma? Kindly solve this doubt of mine. My mind is not\ncompletely free from doubts; this little mind is still discussing whether the\nReality is dual or one; I cannot solve myself. So dost Thou say from Thy mouth\nand cut my doubts asunder. Whether Thou art male or female, describe in detail\nto me. So that, knowing the Highest S'akti, I be freed from this ocean\nSamsara.\n\n\n\nThus ends the fifth chapter of the Third Skandha on the chanting of hymns by\nHara and Brahma in the Maha Pura _n_ am S'rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 6](bk03ch06.htm)\n\n"
