If it be said that (the soul is) not atomic, on account of scriptural\nstatements about what is not that (i.e. what is opposed to atomic size); we\ndeny\n\np. 37\n\nthat, on account of the other one (the highest Self) being the subject-matter\n(of those passages).\n\nNevertheless, it may be objected, the soul cannot be of atomic size, because\nthere are scriptural statements of what is not that, i.e. because there are\nscriptural statements of its size being the opposite of atomic size. So that\nby accepting the alternative of atomic size we should place ourselves in\nopposition to scriptural passages such as the following, 'He is that great\nunborn Self who consists of knowledge, is surrounded by the Pra _n_ as, the\nether within the heart' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22); 'Like the ether he is\nomnipresent, eternal;' 'Truth, knowledge, infinite is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II.\ni).\n\nThis objection, the purvapakshin replies, is not valid 'on account of the\nother one forming the subject of discussion.' For those statements about a\nsize different (from the atomic one) occur under the heading of the highest\nSelf which on account of its pre-eminence constitutes the general object of\nknowledge in all Vedanta-texts; and moreover the passage, 'It is spotless,\nbeyond the ether' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 20), specially proves that the highest\nSelf constitutes the subject-matter (in the passage quoted above from the B\n_ri_. Up.). Thus with regard to the other passages also.--But from the\nexpressions, 'consisting of knowledge, surrounded by the pra _n_ as,' it\nappears that the embodied Self only (not the highest Self) is designated as\nconnected with greatness.--That designation, the purvapakshin replies, is\nfounded on an intuition, vouched for by scripture, as in the case of Vamadeva\n1.--As therefore the statements of a different size refer to the highest Self\n(pra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a), they do not militate against the view of the individual soul\nbeing of atomic size.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[37:1](sbe38022.htm#fr_24) Who 'paramarthad _ri_ sh _t_ ya' identifies himself\nwith everything in the universe, ( _Ri_ g-veda Sa _m_ hita IV, 26. 1 ff.).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 22](sbe38023.htm)\n\n"
