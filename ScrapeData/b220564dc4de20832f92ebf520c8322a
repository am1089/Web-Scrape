He produced living beings (or offspring), and\nhaving produced living beings he went upwards,--he went to that world where\nthat (sun) now shines. And, indeed, there was then no other (victim) meet for\nsacrifice but that one (Pra _g_ apati), and the gods set about offering him up\nin sacrifice.\n\n10:2:2:22\\. Wherefore it is with reference to this that the _Ri_ shi has said\n(Va _g_. S. XXXI, 16, _Ri_ g-veda X, 90, 16), 'The gods offered up sacrifice\nby sacrifice,'--for by sacrifice they did offer up him (Pra _g_ apati), the\nsacrifice;--'these were the first ordinances:'--for these laws were instituted\nfirst;--'these powers clung unto the firmament,'--the firmament is the world\nof heaven, and the powers are the gods: thus, 'Those gods who offered up that\nsacrifice shall cling to the world of heaven;'--\n\n10:2:2:33\\. 'Where first the perfect gods were,'--the perfect 2 gods,\ndoubtless, are the vital airs, for it is they that perfected him in the\nbeginning 3 when they\n\np. 305\n\nwere desirous of becoming that (body of Pra _g_ apati 1); and even now,\nindeed, they do perfect (him).--[ _Ri_ g-veda X, 149, 3]--'Thereafter this\nother became meet for sacrifice by the abundance of the immortal world,'--for\nthereafter, indeed, other things here--whatsoever is immortal--became fit for\nsacrifice.\n\n10:2:2:44\\. 'Savit _ri_ 's well-winged eagle verily was first born, and he was\naccording to his ordinance,'--the well-winged eagle, doubtless, is Pra _g_\napati, and Savit _ri_ is that (sun): thus, 'In accordance with his (the sun's)\nlaw he indeed (comported himself).'\n\n10:2:2:55\\. He indeed consists of seven persons, for that Person 2 consisted\nof seven persons;--to wit, the body of four, and the wings and tail of three,\nfor of four the body of that Person consisted, and of three his wings and\ntail.\n\n10:2:2:66\\. He measures it (the altar) by the man with upstretched arms 3; for\nthe sacrifice is a man, and by him everything here is measured; and that is\nhis highest measure when he stands with up-stretched arms: he thus secures for\nhim what is his highest measure, and therewith he then measures it. And what\n(space) there is over and above that when he is raised on the forepart of his\nfoot, that he secures by the enclosing-stones; and hence he\n\np. 306\n\nshould dig a line for the enclosing-stones outside (the altar-ground).\n\n10:2:2:77\\. Two cubits he gives to the two wings: he thereby lays strength\ninto the wings. And the wings are (the bird's) arms, and by means of the arms\nfood is eaten: it is thus for the sake of food that he gives them that space;\nand when he gives two cubits to the two wings, it is because food is taken\nfrom the distance of a cubit.\n\n10:2:2:88\\. To the tail he gives a span: he thus lays strength into the\nsupport, for the tail is the support. The span means the hand 1, and by means\nof the hand food is eaten: it is thus for the sake of food that he gives it\nthat space; and when he gives a span to the tail, he thereby settles him\n(Agni) in (the midst of) food; and when he gives less (space) to this (part of\nthe body), it is because he thereby settles him in (the midst of) food 2. But,\nindeed, so much does this (the bird's wing) measure, and so much this (the\nbird's tail), and hence when he thus measures them, it is for the sake of\nsecuring for him that (natural measure).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[304:1](sbe4351.htm#fr_585) Literally, those seven persons which they made\ninto one person. See VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.\n\n[304:2](sbe4351.htm#fr_586) It is difficult to see what meaning the author\nassigns to 'sadhya' applied to minor classes of deities.\n\n[304:3](sbe4351.htm#fr_587) See VI, 1, 1, 1.\n\n[305:1](sbe4351.htm#fr_588) Tad eva bubhushanta iti, pra _n_ a _h_ svayam api\n[pra _g_ apatyatmana](errata.htm#5) (? pra _g_ apatyatmano) bhavitum i _k_\n_kh_ anta _h_.
