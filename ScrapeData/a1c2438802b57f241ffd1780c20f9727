Ah, mine own!'  \nWith voice resembling Rama's tone.  \nWhen Lakshman hears his brother's cry,  \nImpelled by Sita he will fly,  \nRestless with eager love, to aid  \nThe hunter in the distant shade.  \nWhen both her guards have left her side,  \nEven as Indra, thousand-eyed,  \nClasps Sachi, will I bear away  \nThe Maithil dame an easy prey.  \nWhen thou, my friend, this aid hast lent,  \nGo where thou wilt and live content.  \nTrue servant, faithful to thy vow,  \nWith [*half?} my realm I thee endow.  \nGo forth, may luck thy way attend  \nThat leads thee to the happy end.  \n[I:ii m.,ir v}, will quickly be  \n\nIn Dandak wood, and follow thee.  \nSo will I cheat this Rama's eyes  \nAnd win without a blow the prize;  \nAnd safe return to Lanka's town  \nWith thee, my friend, this day shall crown.  \nBut if thou wilt not aid my will,  \nMy band this day thy blood shall spill.  \nYea, thou must share the destined task,  \nFor force will take the help I ask.  \nNo bliss that rebel's life attends  \nWhose stubborn will his lord offends.  \n   Thy life, if thou the task assay,  \n     jeopardy may stand;  \n   Oppose me, and this very day  \n     Thou diest by this hand.  \n   Now ponder all that thou hast heard  \n     Within thy prudent breast:  \n   Reflect with care on every word,  \n     And do what seems the best.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLI.: Maricha's Reply.](ry239.htm)\n\n"
