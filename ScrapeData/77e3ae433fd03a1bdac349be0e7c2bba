'On account of conduct'; not so, since ( _k_ ara _n_ a) connotes works;\nthus Karsh _n_ a _g_ ini thinks.\n\nIn the phrases 'those whose works were good' (rama _n_ iya- _k_ ara _n_ a _h_\n), and 'those whose works were bad' (kapuya- _k_ ara _n_ a _h_ ), the word _k_\nara _n_ a does not denote good and evil works (i.e. not such works as the Veda\non the one hand enjoins as leading to certain rewards, and on the other\nprohibits, threatening punishment), for, in Vedic as well as ordinary\nlanguage, the term _k_ ara _n_ a is generally used in the sense of a _k_ ara,\ni.e. general conduct. In ordinary speech such words as a _k_ ara, _s_ ila, v\n_ri_ tta are considered synonymous, and in the Veda we read 'whatever works\n(karma _n_ i) are blameless, those should be regarded, not others. Whatever\nour good conduct (su- _k_ aritani) was, that should be observed by thee,\nnothing else' (Taitt. Up. I, 11, 2)--where 'works' and 'conduct' are\ndistinguished. Difference in quality of birth therefore depends on conduct,\nnot on the remainder of works performed with a view to certain results.--This\nprima facie view the Sutra sets aside, 'not so,because the scriptural term _k_\nara _n_ a connotes works; thus the teacher _K_ arsh _n_ a _g_ ini thinks.' For\nmere conduct does not lead to experiences of pleasure and pain; pleasure and\npain are the results of _works_ in the limited sense.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 10.
