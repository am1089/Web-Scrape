Charm to secure harmony.\n\n1\\. Unity of heart, and unity of mind, freedom from hatred, do I procure for\nyou. Do ye take delight in one another, as a cow in her (new-) born calf!  \n2\\. The son shall be devoted to his father, be of the same mind with his\nmother; the wife shall speak honied, sweet, words to her husband!  \n3\\. The brother shall not hate the brother, and the sister not the sister!\nHarmonious, devoted to the same purpose, speak ye words in kindly spirit!  \n4\\. That charm which causes the gods not to disagree, and not to hate one\nanother, that do we prepare in your house, as a means of agreement for your\nfolk.  \n5\\. Following your leader, of (the same) mind, do ye not hold yourselves\napart! Do ye come here, co-operating, going along the same wagon-pole,\nspeaking agreeably to one another! I render you of the same aim, of the same\nmind.  \n6\\. Identical shall be your drink, in common shall be your share of food! I\nyoke you together in the same traces: do ye worship Agni, joining together, as\nspokes around about the hub!  \n7\\. I render you of the same aim, of the same mind, all paying deference to\none (person) through my harmonising charm. Like the gods that are guarding the\nambrosia, may he (the leader) be welldisposed towards you, night and day!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 73. Charm to allay discord](av154.htm)\n\n'
