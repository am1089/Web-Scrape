But as the Self (scriptural texts) acknowledge and make us comprehend (the\nLord).\n\nThe Sutrakara now considers the question whether the highest Self whose\ncharacteristics scripture declares is\n\np. 338\n\nto be understood as the 'I' or as different from me.--But how can a doubt\narise, considering that scripture exhibits the term 'Self' whose sphere is the\ninward Self?--This term 'Self'--a reply may be given--may be taken in its\nprimary sense, provided it be possible to view the individual soul and the\nLord as non-different; but in the other case the term has to be taken in a\nsecondary (metaphorical) sense only 1.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the term 'Self is not to be taken as meaning\nthe 'I.' For that which possesses the qualities of being free from all evil,\n&c., cannot be understood as possessing qualities of a contrary nature, nor\ncan that which possesses those contrary qualities be understood as being free\nfrom all evil and so on. But the highest Lord possesses the qualities of being\nfree from all evil, &c., and the embodied Self is characterised by qualities\nof a contrary nature.--Moreover, if the transmigrating soul constituted the\nSelf of the Lord, it would follow that he is no Lord, and thus scripture would\nlose its meaning; while, if the Lord constituted the Self of the individual\nsoul, the latter would not be entitled (to works and knowledge), and scripture\nwould thus also lose its meaning. The latter assumption would moreover run\ncounter to perception and the other means of proof.--Should it be said that,\nalthough the Lord and the soul are different, they yet must be contemplated as\nidentical, on the basis of scripture, just as Vishnu and other divinities are\ncontemplated in images and so on; the answer is that this contemplation may\ntake place, but that therefrom we must not conclude that the Lord is the real\nSelf of the transmigrating soul.\n\nTo all this we make the following reply. The highest Lord must be understood\nas the Self. For in a chapter treating of the highest Lord the _G_ abalas\nacknowledge him to be the Self, 'Thou indeed I am. O holy divinity; I indeed\nthou art, O divinity!'--In the same light other\n\np. 339\n\ntexts have to be viewed, which also acknowledge the Lord as the Self, such as\n'I am Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10). Moreover certain Vedanta-texts make us\ncomprehend the Lord as the Self, 'Thy Self is this which is within all' (B\n_ri_. Up. III. 4, 1); 'He is thy Self, the ruler within, the immortal' (B\n_ri_. Up. III, 7, 3); 'That is the True, that is the Self, thou art that' (\n_Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 7).--Nor can we admit the truth of the assertion, made by the\npurvapakshin, that all these passages teach merely a contemplation (of the\nLord) in certain symbols, analogous to the contemplation of Vishnu in an\nimage. For that would firstly involve that the texts have not to be understood\nin their primary sense 1; and in the second place there is a difference of\nsyntactical form. For where scripture intends the contemplation of something\nin a symbol, it conveys its meaning through a single enunciation such as\n'Brahman is Mind' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 18, 1), or 'Brahman is \xc3\x82ditya' ( _Kh_. Up.\nIII, 10, 1). But in the passage quoted above, scripture says, 'I am Thou and\nthou art I.' As here the form of expression differs from that of texts\nteaching the contemplation of symbols, the passage must be understood as\nteaching non-difference. This moreover follows from the express prohibition of\nthe view of difference which a number of scriptural texts convey. Compare e.g.\n'Now if a man worships another deity, thinking the deity is one and he\nanother, he does not know' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10); 'From death to death goes\nhe who here perceives any diversity' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 19); 'Whosoever looks\nfor anything elsewhere than in the Self is abandoned by everything' (B _ri_.\nUp. II, 4, 6).--Nor is there any force in the objection that things with\ncontrary qualities cannot be identical; for this opposition of qualities can\nbe shown to be false.--Nor is it true that from our doctrine it would follow\nthat the Lord is not a Lord. For in these matters scripture alone is\nauthoritative, and we, moreover, do not at all admit that scripture teaches\nthe Lord to be the Self of the transmigrating\n\np. 340\n\nsoul, but maintain that by denying the transmigrating character of the soul it\naims at teaching that the soul is the Self of the Lord. From this it follows\nthat the non-dual Lord is free from all evil qualities, and that to ascribe to\nhim contrary qualities is an error.--Nor is it true that the doctrine of\nidentity would imply that nobody is entitled to works, &c., and is contrary to\nperception and so on. For we admit that before true knowledge springs up, the\nsoul is implicated in the transmigratory state, and that this state\nconstitutes the sphere of the operation of perception and so on. On the other\nhand texts such as 'But when the Self only has become all this, how should he\nsee another?' &c., teach that as soon as true knowledge springs up,\nperception, &c., are no longer valid.--Nor do we mind your objecting that if\nperception, &c., cease to be valid, scripture itself ceases to be so; for this\nconclusion is just what we assume. For on the ground of the text, 'Then a\nfather is not a father' up to 'Then the Vedas are not Vedas' (B _ri_. Up. IV,\n3, 22), we ourselves assume that when knowledge springs up scripture ceases to\nbe valid.--And should you ask who then is characterised by the absence of true\nknowledge, we reply: You yourself who ask this question!--And if you retort,\n'But I am the Lord as declared by scripture,' we reply, 'Very well, if you\nhave arrived at that knowledge, then there is nobody who does not possess such\nknowledge.'--This also disposes of the objection, urged by some, that a system\nof non-duality cannot be established because the Self is affected with duality\nby Nescience.\n\nHence we must fix our minds on the Lord as being the Self.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[338:1](sbe38264.htm#fr_208) And in that case the identity of the highest Self\nand the 'I' would not follow from the term 'Self.'\n\n[339:1](sbe38264.htm#fr_209) And this is objectionable as long as it has not\nbeen demonstrated that the primary meaning is altogether inadmissable.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 4](sbe38265.htm)\n\n"
