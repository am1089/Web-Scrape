(The stories told in the Upanishads) are for the purpose of the\npariplava; we deny this on account of (certain stories only) being specified.\n\n'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya had two wives, Maitreyi and Katyayani' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5,\n1); 'Pratardana, forsooth, the son of Divodasa came to the beloved abode of\nIndra' (Kau. Up. III, 1); 'There lived once upon a time _G_ ana _s_ ruti\nPautraya _n_ a, who was a pious giver, giving much and keeping open house' (\n_Kh_. Up. IV, 1, 1); with regard to these and similar stories met with in the\nVedanta portions of scripture there arises a doubt whether they are meant to\nsubserve the performance of the pariplava 1, or to introduce the vidyas\nstanding in proximity to them.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that those scriptural stories subserve the\npariplava because they are stories like others, and because the telling of\nstories is enjoined for the pariplava. And from this it follows that the\nVedanta-texts do not chiefly aim at knowledge, because like mantras they stand\nin a complementary relation to sacrificial performances.\n\nThis conclusion we deny 'on account of the specification.' Under the heading\n'he is to recite the pariplava,' scripture specifies certain definite stories\nsuch as that of 'Manu Vivasvat's son the king.' If, now, for the reason that\nall tales as such are alike, all tales were admitted for the pariplava, the\nmentioned specification would be devoid of meaning. We therefore conclude that\nthose scriptural stories are not meant to be told at the pariplava.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[305:1](sbe38232.htm#fr_195) I.e. have to be recited at stated intervals\nduring the year occupied by the a _s_ vamedha sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 24](sbe38233.htm)\n\n"
