'Memory 1 (smara) is better than ether. Therefore where many are assembled\ntogether, if they have no memory, they would hear no one, they would not\nperceive, they would not understand. Through memory we know our sons, through\nmemory our cattle. Meditate on memory.\n\n2\\. 'He who meditates on memory as Brahman, is, as it were, lord and master as\nfar as memory reaches;--he who meditates on memory as Brahman.'\n\n'Sir, is there something better than memory?'\n\n'Yes, there is something better than memory.'\n\n'Sir, tell it me.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[119:1](sbe01147.htm#fr_315) The apparent distance between ether and memory is\nbridged over by the commentator pointing out that without memory everything\nwould be as if it were not, so far as we are concerned.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 14](sbe01148.htm)\n\n"
