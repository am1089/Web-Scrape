May the two A _s_ vins protect you. B _ri_ haspati is your herdsman. May Pushan drive you back again'\xc2\x97\n\np. 185\n\nthis (verse) he recites over the cows when they go away (to their pasture-\ngrounds), and (the verse), 'May Pushan go after our cows' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h.\nIV, 1, 11, 2).\n\n2\\. With (the verse), 'These cows that have come hither, free from disease and\nprolific, may they swim (full of wealth) like rivers; may they pour out\n(wealth), as (rivers discharge their floods) into the ocean'\xc2\x97he looks at the\ncows, when they are coming back.\n\n3. 3 With (the formula), 'You are a stand at rest; may I (?) become your stand at rest. You are immovable. Do not move from me. May I not move from you, the blessed ones'\xc2\x97(he looks at them) when they are standing still.\n\n4\\. With (the formula), 'I see you full of sap. Full of sap you shall see\nme'\xc2\x97(he looks at them) when they are gone into the stable, and with (the\nformula), 'May I be prosperous through your thousandfold prospering.'\n\n5. 5 Then having put wood on the fire amid the cows, and having performed the rites down to the Vyah _ri_ ti (oblations), he makes oblations of milk with (the verses),\n\n'Blaze brightly, O _G_ atavedas, driving destruction away from me. Bring me\ncattle and maintenance from all quarters of the heaven. Svaha!\n\n'May _G_ atavedas do no harm to us, to cows and horses, to men and to all that\nmoves. Come hither,\n\np. 186\n\n[paragraph continues] Agni, fearlessly; make me attain to welfare! Svaha!'\xc2\x97\n\nAnd with (the two verses), 'This is the influx of the waters,' and 'Adoration\nto thee, the rapid one, the shining one' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 6, 1, 3).\n\n6\\. Then follow oblations with the verses), 'This, O Varu _n_ a' (&c.; see I,\n2, 8, 16, down to the end of the Sutra).\n\nEnd of the Fifth Pa _t_ ala.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[184:1](sbe30061.htm#fr_606) 18, 1 seq. Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana III, 9; Gobhila\nIII, 6; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana II, 10.\n\n[185:3](sbe30061.htm#fr_607) The Mantra is very corrupt. I think it ought to\nbe corrected somehow in the following way: sa _m_ stha stha sa _m_ stha vo\nbhtuyasam a _k_ yuta stha ma ma _k_ _k_ yo _dh_ vam maha _m_ bhavatibhya _s_\n_k_ yoshi. Comp. also Dr. Kirste's note.\n\n[185:5](sbe30061.htm#fr_608) In the second verse I propose to change abibhrad\ninto p. 186 abibhyad; comp. Atharva-veda XIX, 65, 1: ava ta _m_ _g_ ahi harasa\n_G_ atavedo\xe0\xa4\xbdbibhyad ugro\xe0\xa4\xbd r _k_ isha divam a roha surya. The last words of\nthis verse should be _s_ riyam ma pratipadaya, or something similar.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 6, 19](sbe30062.htm)\n\n"
