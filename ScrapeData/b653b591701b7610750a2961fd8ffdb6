They are regarded as the V\xc4\x81hans, or vehicles, upon\nwhich these gods and goddesses travel. Thus Indra rides upon the elephant\nAiravata; Siva on the bull Nandi; Yama on a buffalo; Durg\xc4\x81, as Singhav\xc4\x81hini,\non a lion, as Durg\xc4\x81 on a tiger; Agni on a ram; V\xc4\x81yu on an antelope; Ganesa on\na rat, and Sasti on a cat. Virabhadra, the emanation of Siva which destroyed\nDaksha\'s sacrifice, rode on a dog, and K\xc4\x81madeva travelled either on the\nmonster Makara or a parrot. The jackal is regarded as a representative of\nDurg\xc4\x81, who in this form assisted in preserving Krishna, on the night of his\nbirth, from Kansa\'s anger. Monkeys, as representatives of Hanum\xc4\x81n, are very\ncommonly worshipped; the dog, though worshipped by some, by others is regarded\nas unclean.\n\nAmongst birds, the goose is the V\xc4\x81han of Brahm\xc4\x81, the peacock that of\nKartikeya, Sani rides upon a vulture; the Br\xc4\x81hmani kite is said to be a form\nof Durg\xc4\x81, and the Khanjana, or wagtail, represents Vishnu, because the mark on\nits throat is thought to resemble the Sh\xc4\x81lgr\xc4\x81ma; the owl, too, is worshipped\nat the festivals of\n\np. 449\n\n[paragraph continues] Kartikeya, Brahm\xc4\x81, and Lakshmi. Garuda, the V\xc4\x81han of\nVishnu, and Jat\xc4\x81yus and Samp\xc4\x81ti, the vultures who assisted R\xc4\x81ma, will be\ndescribed separately.\n\nThe cow, though not regarded as the V\xc4\x81han of any deity, is worshipped too.\nBrahm\xc4\x81 is said to have created cows and Br\xc4\x81hmans at the same time; the Br\xc4\x81hman\nto officiate at worship, and the cow to provide milk, gh\xc4\xab, etc., as offerings,\nwhilst cow-dung is necessary for various purifying ceremonies. Regular worship\nof the cow takes place yearly, at which similar ceremonies are performed to\nthose which are employed at the worship of images; the horns and bodies of the\ncows are painted, and they are then bathed in the rivers. Some people are said\nto worship the cow daily.\n\n##### GARUDA.\n\nGaruda or Superna is a mythical being, half-man and half-eagle, the V\xc4\x81han of\nVishnu. Though not strictly divine, he appears frequently in Vishnu\'s\nexploits, and, being worshipped together with his lord, it is necessary to\ngive some description of his birth and deeds.\n\nWhen Daksha\'s sons refused to people the world, he produced sixty daughters,\nthirteen of whom he gave to Kasyapa the sage; of these, two come into\nprominence in connection with Garuda. Vinat\xc4\x81 bore him two celebrated sons,\nGaruda and Aruna: the former, also called Superna, was the king of the\nfeathered tribes, and the remorseless enemy of the serpent race. Aruna became\nfamous as the charioteer of the Sun. "The progeny of Kadru (the other sister)\nwere a thousand powerful many-headed snakes, of immeasurable might, subject to\nGaruda." * The mother of Garuda is said to have laid an egg; hence her son\nassumed a bird-like form.\n\np. 450\n\nAnother legend makes "Garuda the son of Kasyapa and Diti. This all-prolific\ndame laid an egg, which, it was predicted, would yield her a deliverer from\nsome great evil. After the lapse of five hundred years, Garuda sprang from the\negg, flew to Indra\'s abode, extinguished the fire that surrounded it,\nconquered its\n\n[![GARUDA.](tn/45000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/45000.jpg)  \nGARUDA.  \n\nguards, and bore off the amrita, which enabled him to liberate his captive\nmother. A few drops of the immortal beverage falling on some _Kusa_ grass, it\nbecame eternally consecrated; and the serpents greedily licking it, so\nlacerated their tongues with the sharp grass, that they have ever since\nremained forked. But the boon of immortality was ensured to them by their\npartaking\n\np. 451\n\nof the amrita." * "As soon as Garuda was born, his body expanded till it\ntouched the sky; the other animals were terrified. His eyes were like the\nlightning. The mountains were driven away with the wind caused by the flapping\nof his wings. The rays which issued from his body set the four quarters of the\nworld on fire; the affrighted gods imagining that Garuda must be an\nincarnation of Agni, resorted to that deity for protection." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nGaruda is the mortal enemy of snakes. His mother Vinat\xc4\x81 quarrelled with her\nsister, Kadru, the mother of the snakes, respecting the colour of the horse\nthat was produced at the churning of the ocean; since that time there has been\nconstant enmity between their descendants. On the occasion of his marriage,\nthe serpents, alarmed at the thought of his having children who might destroy\nthem, made. a fierce attack on him; but the result was that he slew them all,\nsave one, which he has ever since worn as an ornament round his neck. To this\nday superstitious Hindus repeat the name of Garuda three times before going to\nsleep at night, as a safeguard against snakes.\n\nThe following legend from the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata \xe2\x80\xa1 gives the account of his\nliberating his mother from servitude, and of his appointment as the V\xc4\x81han of\nVishnu. His mother, having lost her wager with her sister respecting the\ncolour of the sea-produced horse, was reduced to servitude to the serpents,\nwho, being anxious to become immortal, promised to liberate her on condition\nthat her son Garuda should bring them Chandra (the Moon), whose bright spots\nare filled with amrita. Before starting on this expedition he went to his\nmother for\n\np. 452\n\nfood, who advised him to go to the seashore and gather whatever he could find,\nbut entreated him to be most careful not to eat a Br\xc4\x81hman; adding, "Should you\nat any time feel a burning sensation in your stomach, be sure you have eaten a\nBr\xc4\x81hman."\n\nAfter receiving this warning, he set off on his journey. Passing through a\ncountry inhabited by fishermen, he at one inspiration drew in houses, trees,\ncattle, men, and other animals. But among the inhabitants swallowed, one was a\nBr\xc4\x81hman, who caused such an intolerable burning in his stomach that Garuda,\nunable to bear it, called in the greatest haste for him to come out. The\nBr\xc4\x81hman refused unless his wife, a fisherman\'s daughter, might accompany him.\nTo this Garuda consented.\n\nPursuing his journey, Garuda met his father Kasyapa (he shines as the Pole\nStar), who directed him to appease his hunger at a certain lake where an\nelephant and tortoise were fighting. The tortoise was eighty miles long, and\nthe elephant one hundred and sixty. Garuda with one claw seized the elephant,\nwith the other the tortoise, and perched with them on a tree eight hundred\nmiles high. But the tree was unable to bear the ponderous weight, and,\nunhappily, thousands of pigmy Br\xc4\x81hmans were then worshipping on one of its\nbranches. Trembling lest he should destroy any of them, he took the bough in\nhis beak, continuing to hold the elephant and tortoise in his claws, and flew\nto a mountain in an uninhabited country, where he finished his repast on the\ntortoise and elephant.\n\nGaruda having surmounted astonishing dangers, at last seized the Moon and\nconcealed it under his wing. On his return, however, being attacked by Indra\nand the gods, he overcame all, excepting Vishnu. Even Vishnu was so severely\nput to it in the contest, that he\n\np. 453\n\ncame to terms with Garuda, made him immortal, and promised him a higher seat\nthan his own; while on his part Garuda became the V\xc4\x81han or carrier of Vishnu.\nSince then, Vishnu rides upon Garuda, while the latter, in the shape of a\nflag, sits at the top of Vishnu\'s car.\n\nIn the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana Garuda is represented as doing great service to R\xc4\x81ma and his\nfollowers, and his powers and peculiarities are repeatedly referred to. Thus,\nin the description of Hanum\xc4\x81n it is said, that\n\n"Like a thunderbolt in frame was he,  \n And swift as Garud\'s self could flee." *\n\nIn like manner it is said of two heroes:\n\n"Sugriva, offspring of the Sun,  \n And B\xc4\x81li, Indra\'s mighty one,  \n They, both endowed with Garud\'s might,  \n And skilled in all the arts of fight,  \n Wandered in arms the forest through,  \n And lions and snakes and tigers slew." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nWhen Ansum\xc4\x81n found the ashes of the sixty thousand sons of S\xc4\x81gar, \xe2\x80\xa1 who, owing\nto Kapila\'s curse, had been destroyed, and was in distress because he could\nobtain no water with which to offer oblations for the dead, he sees their\nuncle--\n\n"King Garud, best beyond compare,  \n Of birds who wing the fields of air.  \n Then thus unto the weeping man  \n The son of Vinat\xc4\x81 began:  \n \'Grieve not, O hero, for their fall,  \n Who died a death approved of all.\'" \xc2\xa7\n\nGaruda then tells Ansum\xc4\x81n that if he can succeed in inducing Gang\xc4\x81 to descend\nfrom heaven, and with her\n\np. 454\n\nstreams to touch these ashes, the dead shall return to life, and finally\nascend to Indra\'s heaven.\n\nIn the description of the city of Ayodha, when R\xc4\x81ma had gone into the forest,\nis a reference to Garuda\'s antipathy to snakes:--\n\n           "The city wore  \n No look of beauty as before--  \n Like a dull river or a lake  \n By Garud robbed of every snake." *\n\nIn the following lines is an account of Garuda\'s resting on a tree when he was\ncarrying off the elephant and the tortoise as narrated above. R\xc4\x81vana impelled\nby the accounts of Sit\xc4\x81\'s beauty, goes to see her, and on his journey\n\n"He saw a fig-tree like a cloud,  \n With mighty branches earthward bowed.  \n It stretched a hundred leagues, and made  \n For hermit bands a welcome shade.  \n Thither the feathered king of yore  \n An elephant and tortoise bore,  \n And lighted on a bough to eat  \n The captives of his taloned feet.  \n The bough, unable to sustain  \n The crushing weight and sudden strain,  \n Loaded with sprays and leaves of spring,  \n Gave way beneath the feathered king.  \n      *         *         *         *  \n The feathered monarch raised the weight  \n Of the huge bough, and bore away  \n The loosened load and captured prey.  \n      *         *         *         *  \n His soul conceived the high emprise  \n To snatch the amrit from the skies.  \n He rent the nets of iron first,  \n Then through the jewel chamber burst,  \n And bore the drink of heaven away  \n That watched in Indra\'s palace lay." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\np. 455\n\nIn the great conflict with R\xc4\x81vana, as R\xc4\x81ma and his brother were wounded and\nwell-nigh dead, owing to a flight of serpents sent by Indrajit, Garuda\nappeared to restore them, and thus enabled them to carry on the war. His\napproach and work are thus described:--\n\n            "The rushing wind grew loud,  \n Red lightnings flashed from banks of cloud,  \n The mountains shook, the wild waves rose,  \n And, smitten by resistless blows,  \n Uprooted fell each stately tree  \n That fringed the margin of the sea.  \n All life within the waters feared:  \n Then, as the V\xc4\x81nars gazed, appeared  \n King Garud\'s self, a wondrous sight,  \n Disclosed in flames of fiery light.  \n From his fierce eye in sudden dread  \n All serpents in a moment fled;  \n And those transformed to shafts, that bound  \n The princes, vanished in the ground.  \n On Raghu\'s sons his eyes he bent,  \n And hailed the lords omnipotent.  \n Then o\'er them stooped the feathered king,  \n And touched their faces with his wing.  \n His healing touch their pangs allayed,  \n And closed each rent the shafts had made.  \n Again their eyes were bright and bold;  \n Again the smooth skin shone like gold." *\n\nFor this great work of restoration R\xc4\x81ma expressed his gratitude, whereupon\nGaruda replied--\n\n"In me, O Raghu\'s son, behold  \n One who has loved thee from of old.  \n Garud, the lord of all that fly,  \n Thy guardian and thy friend am I.  \n Not all the gods in heaven could loose  \n These numbing bonds, this serpent noose,  \n Wherewith fierce R\xc4\x81van\'s son, renowned  \n For magic arts, your limbs had bound.\n\np. 456\n\n[paragraph continues]  Those arrows fixed in every limb  \n Were mighty snakes, transformed by him.  \n Bloodthirsty race, they live beneath  \n The earth, and slay with venomed teeth."\n\nGaruda is represented in pictures and sculpture in various ways. Sometimes he\nhas the head and wings of a bird, with a human body; sometimes he has a bird\'s\nclaws; and at others he has a human face, and the body of a bird.\n\n##### JATAYUS AND SAMPATI.\n\nGaruda had two sons, named Jat\xc4\x81yus and Samp\xc4\x81ti, who also assisted R\xc4\x81ma. As he,\nLakshman and Sati reached the hermitage in the forest where they intended to\nremain, they saw "a mighty vulture, of size and strength unparalleled." Struck\nwith his appearance, R\xc4\x81ma inquired who he was, when Jat\xc4\x81yus informed them of\nhis parentage, and offered to be their friend:\n\n"Thy ready helper will I be  \n And guard thy house, if thou agree:  \n When thou and Lakshman urge the chase,  \n By Sit\xc4\x81\'s side shall be my place." *\n\nThis offer was accepted; and when R\xc4\x81ma saw the stag which R\xc4\x81vana sent to\nattract him from his home, he went after it with the greater sense of security\nbecause Jat\xc4\x81yus was there to guard his wife. When R\xc4\x81vana seized Sit\xc4\x81, she\ncried out to Jat\xc4\x81yus--\n\n"Oh see, the king who rules the race  \n Of giants, cruel, fierce, and base!  \n R\xc4\x81van, the spoiler, bears me hence,  \n The helpless prey of violence." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\np. 457\n\nJat\xc4\x81yus first tries by reasoning to lead R\xc4\x81vana to restore Sit\xc4\x81 to her home,\nand warned him that death would result from his act of violence. When,\nhowever,\n\n[![JAT\xc4\x80YUS.](tn/45700.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/45700.jpg)  \nJAT\xc4\x80YUS.  \n\nneither advice nor threats availed, he prepared to fight.\n\n"With clash and din and furious blows  \n Of murderous battle met the foes:  \n      *         *         *         *\n\np. 458\n\n[paragraph continues]  Then fierce the dreadful combat raged,  \n As fiend and bird in war engaged,  \n As if two winged mountains sped  \n To dire encounter overhead." *\n\nJat\xc4\x81yus succeeded in breaking R\xc4\x81vana\'s bow, but--\n\n"A second bow soon armed his hand,  \n Whence pointed arrows swift and true  \n In hundreds, yea, in thousands flew." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThe giant\'s arrows wounded the vulture; the vulture in return threw darts\nwhich injured R\xc4\x81vana, struck the steeds of the chariot, and broke the chariot\nitself; whilst with his beak and claws he tore the coachman to pieces. R\xc4\x81vana\ndescended from his chariot and fought on foot; but gradually the strength of\nJat\xc4\x81yus, who was weak with age, gave way. R\xc4\x81vana, therefore, re-ascends the\nchariot, and is about to fly through the air, when the vulture a second time\nintercepts his flight, and--\n\n"Swooped down upon the giant\'s back:  \n Down to the bone the talons went;  \n With many a wound the flesh was rent." \xe2\x80\xa1\n\nJat\xc4\x81yus was able to tear off the ten left arms of R\xc4\x81vana, but unfortunately\nothers grew to replace them. At length R\xc4\x81vana seizes his sword, and, after\ngiving the vulture a mortal blow, hurries off with Sit\xc4\x81 to Lanka.\n\nWhen R\xc4\x81ma and Lakshman commence their search for Sit\xc4\x81, they come upon the\ndying bird, and, seeing the marks of blood upon him, at first think that he\nhas been guilty of carrying off the lady; but, after hearing from him the\nstory of R\xc4\x81vana\'s visit and flight, they watch the bird expire, and perform\nhis funeral rites.\n\nIn their search, reaching the seashore, but still ignorant\n\np. 459\n\nof Sit\xc4\x81\'s whereabouts, some of their monkey followers see an immense vulture,\nweak with age, who, hearing them mention Jat\xc4\x81yus\' name, inquires of his\nwelfare. When told that he had been slain by R\xc4\x81vana, the vulture informs them\nthat this victim of the giant was no other than his own brother; and in\nrevenge assists them, by informing them where R\xc4\x81vana and Sit\xc4\x81 were at that\nmoment. He told them that he had Garuda\'s power to see immense distances, and,\nmounting into the sky, saw Lanka, and told the V\xc4\x81nar chiefs that the object of\ntheir search was there. Hearing this, Hanum\xc4\x81n was despatched to communicate\nwith Sit\xc4\x81, and to assure her of R\xc4\x81ma\'s coming to rescue her.\n\n[![THE LOTUS.](tn/45900.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/45900.jpg)  \nTHE LOTUS.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[449:*](hmvp44.htm#fr_410) "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," p. 119.\n\n[451:*](hmvp44.htm#fr_411) Moor\'s "Hindu Pantheon," 341.\n\n[451:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp44.htm#fr_412) Ward, ii. 200.\n\n[451:\xe2\x80\xa1](hmvp44.htm#fr_413) Ibid., ii. 201.\n\n[453:*](hmvp44.htm#fr_414) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," i. 94.\n\n[453:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp44.htm#fr_415) Ibid., i. 96.\n\n[453:\xe2\x80\xa1](hmvp44.htm#fr_416) See Gang\xc4\x81.\n\n[453:\xc2\xa7](hmvp44.htm#fr_417) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," i. 186.\n\n[454:*](hmvp44.htm#fr_418) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," ii. 167.\n\n[454:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp44.htm#fr_419) Ibid., iii. 162.\n\n[455:*](hmvp44.htm#fr_420) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," v. 153.\n\n[456:*](hmvp44.htm#fr_421) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," iii. 68.\n\n[456:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp44.htm#fr_422) Ibid., 230.\n\n[458:*](hmvp44.htm#fr_423) "Griffiths\'s R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," iii. 236.\n\n[458:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp44.htm#fr_424) Ibid., 237.\n\n[458:\xe2\x80\xa1](hmvp44.htm#fr_425) Ibid., 240.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VIII.
