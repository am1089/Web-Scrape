Suta said :-- O Ri _s_ is! Then Indra and all the other Devas taking\nBrahma along with them and placing Him at the front, went to Mahadeva and took\nHis refuge. They bowed down to Him and chanted sweet and great hymns to Him,\nWho holds Moon on His forehead, Deva of the Devas, thus :--\n\n\n\n3-5. O Thou, the Leader of the host of Gods! Victory to Thee! O Thou, Whose\nlotus feet are served by Uma, Victory to Thee! O Thou, the Giver of the eight\nSiddhis and Vibhutis (extraordinary powers) to Thy devotees, Victory to Thee!\nO Thou, the Background of this Great Theatrical Dance of this Insurmountable\nMaya! Thou art the Supreme Spirit in Thy True Nature! Thou ridest on Thy\nvehicle, the Bull, and residest in Kailas'a; yet Thou art the Lord of all the\nDevas. O Thou, Whose ornament is snakes, Who art the Honoured and the Giver of\nhonours to persons! O Thou! the Unborn, yet comprising all forms, O Thou\nS'ambhu! That findest pleasure in this Thy Own Self! Victory toThee!\n\n\n\n6-9. O Thou, the Lord of Thy attendants! O Thou, Giris'a! The Giver of the\ngreat powers, praised by Maha Vi _sn_ u! O Thou, That livest in the heart\nlotus of Vi _sn_ u, and deeply absorbed in Maha Yoga! Obeisance to Thee! O\nThou that can'st be known through Yoga, and nothing but the Yoga itself; Thou,\nthe Lord of the Yoga! We bow down to Thee. Thou awardest the fruits of yoga to\nthe Yogins. O Thou, the Lord of the helpless! The Incarnate of the ocean of\nmercy! The Relief of the diseased and the most powerful! O Thou, whose forms\nare the three gu _n_ as, Sattva, Rajo, Tamas! O Thou! Whose Emblem (carrier)\nis the Bull (Dharma); Thou art verily the Great Kala; yet Thou art the Lord of\nKala! Obeisance to Thee! (The Bull represents the Dharma or Speech).\n\n\n\n10\\. Thus praised by the Devas, who take the offerings in sacrifices the Lord\nof the Devas, whose emblem is Bull, smilingly told the Devas in a deep voice\n:--\n\n\n\n11\\. O Thou, the excellent Devas! The residents of the Heavens! I am pleased\nwith the praises that you have sung of Me. I will fulfil the desires of you,\nall the Devas.\n\n\n\n12-15. The Devas said :-- O Lord of all the Devas! O Giris'a! Thou whose\nforehead is adorned with Moon! O Thou, the Doer of good to the distressed. O\nThou, the Powerful! Dost Thou do good to us. O Thou, the Sinless One! The\nBindhya Mountain has become jealous of the Sumeru Mountain, and has risen very\nhigh up in the Heavens and he has obstructed the Sun's course, thereby causing\ngreat troubles to all. O\n\n\n\np. 1028\n\n\n\nThou, the Doer of good to all! O \xc3\x8es'ana! Dost Thou check the mountain's\nabnormal rise. How can we fix time if the Sun's course be obstructed! And when\nthere is no knowledge, what is now the time, the sacrifices to the Devas and\nthe offerings to the Pitris are now almost dead and gone. O Deva! Who will now\nprotect us? We see Thee as the Destroyer of the fear of us and of those who\nare terrified. O Deva! O Lord of Giris'a! Be pleased with us.\n\n\n\n16-18. S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan said :-- O Devas! I have no power to curb the Bindhya\nMountain. Let us go to the Lord of Rama and pay our respects to Him. He is our\nLord, fit to be worshipped. He is Gobinda, Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, the Cause of\nall causes. We will go to Him and tell Him all our sorrows. He will remove\nthem.\n\n\n\n19\\. Hearing thus the words of Giris'a, Indra and the other Devas with Brahma\nplaced Mahadeva at their front and went to the region of Vaiku _nt_ ha,\ntrembling with fear.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourth Chapter of the Tenth Book on the going of the Devas to\nMahadeva in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 5](bk10ch05.htm)\n\n"
