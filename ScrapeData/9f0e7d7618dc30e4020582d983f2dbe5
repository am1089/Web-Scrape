The binding of the perceiving consciousness to a certain region is\nattention (dharana).\n\nEmerson quotes Sir Isaac Newton as saying that he made his great discoveries\nby intending his mind on them. That is what is meant here. I read the page of\na book while inking of something else. At the end of he page, I have no idea\nof what it is about, and read it again, still thinking of something else, with\nthe same result. Then I wake up, so to speak, make an effort of attention, fix\nmy thought on what I am reading, and easily take in its meaning. The act of\nwill, the effort of attention, the intending of the mind on each word and line\nof the page, just as the eyes are focussed on each word and line, is the power\nhere contemplated. It is the power to focus the consciousness on a given spot,\nand hold it there Attention is the first and indispensable step in all\nknowledge. Attention to spiritual things is the first step to spiritual\nknowledge.\n\n### 2\\. A prolonged holding of the perceiving consciousness in that region is\nmeditation (dhyana).\n\nThis will apply equally to outer and inner things. I may for a moment fix my\nattention on some visible object, in a single penetrating glance, or I may\nhold the attention fixedly on it until it reveals far more of its nature than\na single glance could perceive. The first is the focussing of the searchlight\nof consciousness upon the object. The other is the holding of the white beam\nof light steadily and persistently on the object, until it yields up the\nsecret of its details. So for things within; one may fix the inner glance for\na moment on spiritual things, or one may hold the consciousness steadily upon\nthem, until what was in the dark slowly comes forth into the light, and yields\nup its immortal secret. But this is possible only for the spiritual man, after\nthe Commandments and the Rules have been kept; for until this is done, the\nthronging storms of psychical thoughts dissipate and distract the attention,\nso that it will not remain fixed on spiritual things. The cares of this world,\nthe deceitfulness of riches, choke the word of the spiritual message.\n\n### 3\\. When the perceiving consciousness in this meditative is wholly given\nto illuminating the essential meaning of the object contemplated, and is freed\nfrom the sense of separateness and personality, this is contemplation\n(samadhi).\n\nLet us review the steps so far taken. First, the beam of perceiving\nconsciousness is focussed on a certain region or subject, through the effort\nof attention. Then this attending consciousness is held on its object. Third,\nthere is the ardent will to know its meaning, to illumine it with\ncomprehending thought. Fourth, all personal bias, all desire merely to indorse\na previous opinion and so prove oneself right, and all desire for personal\nprofit or gratification must be quite put away. There must be a purely\ndisinterested love of truth for its own sake. Thus is the perceiving\nconsciousness made void, as it were, of all personality or sense of\nseparateness. The personal limitation stands aside and lets the All-\nconsciousness come to bear upon the problem. The Oversoul bends its ray upon\nthe object, and illumines it with pure light.\n\n### 4\\. When these three, Attention, Meditation Contemplation, are exercised\nat once, this is perfectly concentrated Meditation (sanyama).\n\nWhen the personal limitation of the perceiving consciousness stands aside, and\nallows the All-conscious to come to bear upon the problem, then arises that\nreal knowledge which is called a flash of genius; that real knowledge which\nmakes discoveries, and without which no discovery can be made, however\npainstaking the effort. For genius is the vision of the spiritual man, and\nthat vision is a question of growth rather than present effort; though right\neffort, rightly continued, will in time infallibly lead to growth and vision.\nThrough the power thus to set aside personal limitation, to push aside petty\nconcerns and cares, and steady the whole nature and will in an ardent love of\ntruth and desire to know it; through the power thus to make way for the All-\nconsciousness, all great men make their discoveries. Newton, watching the\napple fall to the earth, was able to look beyond, to see the subtle waves of\nforce pulsating through apples and worlds and suns and galaxies. and thus to\nperceive universal gravitation. The Oversoul, looking through his eyes,\nrecognized the universal force, one of its own children. Darwin, watching the\nforms and motions of plants and animals, let the same august consciousness\ncome to bear on them, and saw infinite growth perfected through ceaseless\nstruggle. He perceived the superb process of evolution, the Oversoul once more\nrecognizing its own. Fraunhofer, noting the dark lines in the band of sunlight\nin his spectroscope, divined their identity with the bright lines in the\nspectra of incandescent iron, sodium and the rest, and so saw the oneness of\nsubstance in the worlds and suns, the unity of the materials of the universe.\nOnce again the Oversoul, looking with his eyes, recognized its own. So it is\nwith all true knowledge. But the mind must transcend its limitations, its\nidiosyncrasies; there must be purity, for to the pure in heart is the promise,\nthat they shall see God.\n\n### 5\\. By mastering this perfectly concentrated Meditation, there comes the\nillumination of perception.\n\nThe meaning of this is illustrated by what has been said before. When the\nspiritual man is able to throw aside the trammels of emotional and mental\nlimitation, and to open his eyes, he sees clearly, he attains to illuminated\nperception. A poet once said that Occultism is the conscious cultivation of\ngenius; and it is certain that the awakened spiritual man attains to the\nperceptions of genius. Genius is the vision, the power, of the spiritual man,\nwhether its possessor recognizes this or not. All true knowledge is of the\nspiritual man. The greatest in all ages have recognized this and put their\ntestimony on record. The great in wisdom who have not consciously recognized\nit, have ever been full of the spirit of reverence, of selfless devotion to\ntruth, of humility, as was Darwin; and reverence and humility are the\nunconscious recognition of the nearness of the Spirit, that Divinity which\nbroods over us, a Master o'er a slave.\n\n### 6\\. This power is distributed in ascending degrees.\n\nIt is to be attained step by step. It is a question, not of miracle, but of\nevolution, of growth. Newton had to master the multiplication table, then the\nfour rules of arithmetic, then the rudiments of algebra, before he came to the\nbinomial theorem. At each point, there was attention, concentration, insight;\nuntil these were attained, no progress to the next point was possible. So with\nDarwin. He had to learn the form and use of leaf and flower, of bone and\nmuscle; the characteristics of genera and species; the distribution of plants\nand animals, before he had in mind that nexus of knowledge on which the light\nof his great idea was at last able to shine. So is it with all knowledge. So\nis it with spiritual knowledge. Take the matter this way: The first subject\nfor the exercise of my spiritual insight is my day, with its circumstances,\nits hindrances, its opportunities, its duties. I do what I can to solve it, to\nfulfil its duties, to learn its lessons. I try to live my day with aspiration\nand faith. That is the first step. By doing this, I gather a harvest for the\nevening, I gain a deeper insight into life, in virtue of which I begin the\nnext day with a certain advantage, a certain spiritual advance and attainment.\nSo with all successive days. In faith and aspiration, we pass from day to day,\nin growing knowledge and power, with never more than one day to solve at a\ntime, until all life becomes radiant and transparent.\n\n### 7\\. This threefold power, of Attention, Meditation, Contemplation, is more\ninterior than the means of growth previously described.\n\nVery naturally so; because the means of growth previously described were\nconcerned with the extrication of the spiritual man from psychic bondages and\nveils; while this threefold power is to be exercised by the spiritual man thus\nextricated and standing on his feet, viewing life with open eyes.\n\n### 8\\. But this triad is still exterior to the soul vision which is\nunconditioned, free from the seed of mental analyses.\n\nThe reason is this: The threefold power we have been considering, the triad of\nAttention, Contemplation, Meditation is, so far as we have yet considered it,\nthe focussing of the beam of perceiving consciousness upon some form of\nmanifesting being, with a view of understanding it completely. There is a\nhigher stage, where the beam of consciousness is turned back upon itself, and\nthe individual consciousness enters into, and knows, the All consciousness.\nThis is a being, a being in immortality, rather than a knowing; it is free\nfrom mental analysis or mental forms. It is not an activity of the higher\nmind, even the mind of the spiritual man. It is an activity of the soul. Had\nNewton risen to this higher stage, he would have known, not the laws of\nmotion, but that high Being, from whose Life comes eternal motion. Had Darwin\nrisen to this, he would have seen the Soul, whose graduated thought and being\nall evolution expresses. There are, therefore, these two perceptions: that of\nliving things, and that of the Life; that of the Soul's works, and that of the\nSoul itself.\n\n### 9\\. One of the ascending degrees is the development of Control. First\nthere is the overcoming of the mind-impress of excitation. Then comes the\nmanifestation of the mind-impress of Control. Then the perceiving\nconsciousness follows after the moment of Control.\n\nThis is the development of Control. The meaning seems to be this: Some object\nenters the field of observation, and at first violently excites the mind,\nstirring up curiosity, fear, wonder; then the consciousness returns upon\nitself, as it were, and takes the perception firmly in hand, steadying itself,\nand viewing the matter calmly from above. This steadying effort of the will\nupon the perceiving consciousness is Control, and immediately upon it follows\nperception, understanding, insight.\n\nTake a trite example. Supposing one is walking in an Indian forest. A charging\nelephant suddenly appears. The man is excited by astonishment, and, perhaps,\nterror. But he exercises an effort of will, perceives the situation in its\ntrue bearings, and recognizes that a certain thing must be done; in this case,\nprobably, that he must get out of the way as quickly as possible.\n\nOr a comet, unheralded, appears in the sky like a flaming sword. The beholder\nis at first astonished, perhaps terror-stricken; but he takes himself in hand,\ncontrols his thoughts, views the apparition calmly, and finally calculates its\norbit and its relation to meteor showers.\n\nThese are extreme illustrations; but with all knowledge the order of\nperception is the same: first, the excitation of the mind by the new object\nimpressed on it; then the control of the mind from within; upon which follows\nthe perception of the nature of the object. Where the eyes of the spiritual\nman are open, this will be a true and penetrating spiritual perception. In\nsome such way do our living experiences come to us; first, with a shock of\npain; then the Soul steadies itself and controls the pain; then the spirit\nperceives the lesson of the event, and its bearing upon the progressive\nrevelation of life.\n\n### 10\\. Through frequent repetition of this process, the mind becomes\nhabituated to it, and there arises an equable flow of perceiving\nconsciousness.\n\nControl of the mind by the Soul, like control of the muscles by the mind,\ncomes by practice, and constant voluntary repetition.\n\nAs an example of control of the muscles by the mind, take the ceaseless\npractice by which a musician gains mastery over his instrument, or a fencer\ngains skill with a rapier. Innumerable small efforts of attention will make a\nresult which seems well-nigh miraculous; which, for the novice, is really\nmiraculous. Then consider that far more wonderful instrument, the perceiving\nmind, played on by that fine musician, the Soul. Here again, innumerable small\nefforts of attention will accumulate into mastery, and a mastery worth\nwinning. For a concrete example, take the gradual conquest of each day, the\neffort to live that day for the Soul. To him that is faithful unto death, the\nMaster gives the crown of life.\n\n### 11\\. The gradual conquest of the mind's tendency to flit from one object\nto another, and the power of one-pointedness, make the development of\nContemplation.\n\nAs an illustration of the mind's tendency to flit from one object to another,\ntake a small boy, learning arithmetic. He begins: two ones are two; three ones\nare three-and then he thinks of three coins in his pocket, which will purchase\nso much candy, in the store down the street, next to the toy-shop, where are\nbase-balls, marbles and so on,--and then he comes back with a jerk, to four\nones are four. So with us also. We are seeking the meaning of our task, but\nthe mind takes advantage of a moment of slackened attention, and flits off\nfrom one frivolous detail to another, till we suddenly come back to\nconsciousness after traversing leagues of space. We must learn to conquer\nthis, and to go back within ourselves into the beam of perceiving\nconsciousness itself, which is a beam of the Oversoul. This is the true one-\npointedness, the bringing of our consciousness to a focus in the Soul.\n\n### 12\\. When, following this, the controlled manifold tendency and the\naroused one-pointedness are equally balanced parts of the perceiving\nconsciousness, his the development of one-pointedness.\n\nThis would seem to mean that the insight which is called one-pointedness has\ntwo sides, equally balanced. There is, first, the manifold aspect of any\nobject, the sum of all its characteristics and properties. This is to be held\nfirmly in the mind. Then there is the perception of the object as a unity, as\na whole, the perception of its essence. First, the details must be clearly\nperceived; then the essence must be comprehended. When the two processes are\nequally balanced, the true one-pointedness is attained. Everything has these\ntwo sides, the side of difference and the side of unity; there is the\nindividual and there is the genus; the pole of matter and diversity, and the\npole of oneness and spirit. To see the object truly, we must see both.\n\n### 13\\. Through this, the inherent character, distinctive marks and\nconditions of being and powers, according to their development, are made\nclear.\n\nBy the power defined in the preceding sutra, the inherent character,\ndistinctive marks and conditions of beings and powers are made clear. For\nthrough this power, as defined, we get a twofold view of each object, seeing\nat once all its individual characteristics and its essential character,\nspecies and genus; we see it in relation to itself, and in relation to the\nEternal. Thus we see a rose as that particular flower, with its colour and\nscent, its peculiar fold of each petal; but we also see in it the species, the\nfamily to which it belongs, with its relation to all plants, to all life, to\nLife itself. So in any day, we see events and circumstances; we also see in it\nthe lesson set for the soul by the Eternal.\n\n### 14\\. Every object has its characteristics which are already quiescent,\nthose which are active, and those which are not yet definable.\n\nEvery object has characteristics belonging to its past, its present and its\nfuture. In a fir tree, for example, there are the stumps or scars of dead\nbranches, which once represented its foremost growth; there are the branches\nwith their needles spread out to the air; there are the buds at the end of\neach branch and twig, which carry the still closely packed needles which are\nthe promise of the future. In like manner, the chrysalis has, as its past, the\ncaterpillar; as its future, the butterfly. The man has, in his past, the\nanimal; in his future, the angel. Both are visible even now in his face. So\nwith all things, for all things change and grow.\n\n### 15\\. Difference in stage is the cause of difference in development.\n\nThis but amplifies what has just been said. The first stage is the sapling,\nthe caterpillar, the animal. The second stage is the growing tree, the\nchrysalis, the man. The third is the splendid pine, the butterfly, the angel.\nDifference of stage is the cause of difference of development. So it is among\nmen, and among the races of men.\n\n### 16\\. Through perfectly concentrated Meditation on the three stages of\ndevelopment comes a knowledge of past and future.\n\nWe have taken our illustrations from natural science, because, since every\ntrue discovery in natural science is a divination of a law in nature, attained\nthrough a flash of genius, such discoveries really represent acts of spiritual\nperception, acts of perception by the spiritual man, even though they are\ngenerally not so recognized. So we may once more use the same illustration.\nPerfectly concentrated Meditation, perfect insight into the chrysalis, reveals\nthe caterpillar that it has been, the butterfly that it is destined to be. He\nwho knows the seed, knows the seed-pod or ear it has come from, and the plant\nthat is to come from it. So in like manner he who really knows today, and the\nheart of to-day, knows its parent yesterday and its child tomorrow. Past,\npresent and future are all in the Eternal. He who dwells in the Eternal knows\nall three.\n\n### 17\\. The sound and the object and the thought called up by a word are\nconfounded because they are all blurred together in the mind. By perfectly\nconcentrated Meditation on the distinction between them, there comes an\nunderstanding of the sounds uttered by all beings.\n\nIt must be remembered that we are speaking of perception by the spiritual man.\n\nSound, like every force, is the expression of a power of the Eternal. Infinite\nshades of this power are expressed in the infinitely varied tones of sound. He\nwho, having entry to the consciousness of the Eternal knows the essence of\nthis power, can divine the meanings of all sounds, from the voice of the\ninsect to the music of the spheres.\n\nIn like manner, he who has attained to spiritual vision can perceive the mind-\nimages in the thoughts of others, with the shade of feeling which goes with\nthem, thus reading their thoughts as easily as he hears their words. Every one\nhas the germ of this power, since difference of tone will give widely\ndiffering meanings to the same words, meanings which are intuitively perceived\nby everyone.\n\n### 18\\. When the mind-impressions become visible, there comes an\nunderstanding of previous births.\n\nThis is simple enough if we grasp the truth of rebirth. The fine harvest of\npast experi ences is drawn into the spiritual nature, forming, indeed, the\nbasis of its development. When the consciousness has been raised to a point\nabove these fine subjective impressions, and can look down upon them from\nabove, this will in itself be a remembering of past births.\n\n### 19\\. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on mind-images is gained the\nunderstanding of the thoughts of others.\n\nHere, for those who can profit by it, is the secret of thought-reading. Take\nthe simplest case of intentional thought transference. It is the testimony of\nthose who have done this, that the perceiving mind must be stilled, before the\nmind-image projected by the other mind can be seen. With it comes a sense of\nthe feeling and temper of the other mind and so on, in higher degrees.\n\n### 20\\. But since that on which the thought in the mind of another rests is\nnot objective to the thought-reader's consciousness, he perceives the thought\nonly, and not also that on which the thought rests.\n\nThe meaning appears to be simple: One may be able to perceive the thoughts of\nsome one at a distance; one cannot, by that means alone, also perceive the\nexternal surroundings of that person, which arouse these thoughts.\n\n### 21\\. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the form of the body, by\narresting the body's perceptibility, and by inhibiting the eye's power of\nsight, there comes the power to make the body invisible.\n\nThere are many instances of the exercise of this power, by mesmerists,\nhypnotists and the like; and we may simply call it an instance of the power of\nsuggestion. Shankara tells us that by this power the popular magicians of the\nEast perform their wonders, working on the mind-images of others, while\nremaining invisible themselves. It is all a question of being able to see and\ncontrol the mind-images.\n\n### 22\\. The works which fill out the life-span may be either immediately or\ngradually operative. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on these comes a\nknowledge of the time of the end, as also through signs.\n\nA garment which is wet, says the commentator, may be hung up to dry, and so\ndry rapidly, or it may be rolled in a ball and dry slowly; so a fire may blaze\nor smoulder. Thus it is with Karma, the works that fill out the life-span. By\nan insight into the mental forms and forces which make up Karma, there comes a\nknowledge of the rapidity or slowness of their development, and of the time\nwhen the debt will be paid.\n\n### 23\\. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on sympathy, compassion and\nkindness, is gained the power of interior union with others.\n\nUnity is the reality; separateness the illusion. The nearer we come to\nreality, the nearer we come to unity of heart. Sympathy, compassion, kindness\nare modes of this unity of heart, whereby we rejoice with those who rejoice,\nand weep with those who weep. These things are learned by desiring to learn\nthem.\n\n### 24\\. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on power, even such power as\nthat of the elephant may be gained.\n\nThis is a pretty image. Elephants possess not only force, but poise and\nfineness of control. They can lift a straw, a child, a tree with perfectly\njudged control and effort. So the simile is a good one. By detachment, by\nwithdrawing into the soul's reservoir of power, we can gain all these, force\nand fineness and poise; the ability to handle with equal mastery things small\nand great, concrete and abstract alike.\n\n### 25\\. By bending upon them the awakened inner light, there comes a\nknowledge of things subtle, or concealed, or obscure.\n\nAs was said at the outset, each consciousness is related to all consciousness;\nand, through it, has a potential consciousness of all things; whether subtle\nor concealed or obscure. An understanding of this great truth will come with\npractice. As one of the wise has said, we have no conception of the power of\nMeditation.\n\n### 26\\. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the sun comes a knowledge of\nthe worlds.\n\nThis has several meanings: First, by a knowledge of the constitution of the\nsun, astronomers can understand the kindred nature of the stars. And it is\nsaid that there is a finer astronomy, where the spiritual man is the\nastronomer. But the sun also means the Soul, and through knowledge of the Soul\ncomes a knowledge of the realms of life.\n\n### 27\\. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the moon comes a knowledge of\nthe lunar mansions.\n\nHere again are different meanings. The moon is, first, the companion planet,\nwhich, each day, passes backward through one mansion of the stars. By watching\nthe moon, the boundaries of the mansion are learned, with their succession in\nthe great time-dial of the sky. But the moon also symbolizes the analytic\nmind, with its divided realms; and these, too, may be understood through\nperfectly concentrated Meditation.\n\n### 28\\. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the fixed pole-star comes a\nknowledge of the motions of the stars.\n\nAddressing Duty, stern daughter of the Voice of God, Wordsworth finely said:\n\nThou cost preserve the stars from wrong,  \nAnd the most ancient heavens through thee are fresh and strong--\n\nthus suggesting a profound relation between the moral powers and the powers\nthat rule the worlds. So in this Sutra the fixed polestar is the eternal\nspirit about which all things move, as well as the star toward which points\nthe axis of the earth. Deep mysteries attend both, and the veil of mystery is\nonly to be raised by Meditation, by open-eyed vision of the awakened spiritual\nman.\n\n### 29\\. Perfectly concentrated Meditation on the centre of force in the lower\ntrunk brings an understanding of the order of the bodily powers.\n\nWe are coming to a vitally important part of the teaching of Yoga: namely, the\nspiritual man's attainment of full self-consciousness, the awakening of the\nspiritual man as a self-conscious individual, behind and above the natural\nman. In this awakening, and in the process of gestation which precedes it,\nthere is a close relation with the powers of the natural man, which are, in a\ncertain sense, the projection, outward and downward, of the powers of the\nspiritual man. This is notably true of that creative power of the spiritual\nman which, when embodied in the natural man, becomes the power of generation.\nNot only is this power the cause of the continuance of the bodily race of\nmankind, but further, in the individual, it is the key to the dominance of the\npersonal life. Rising, as it were, through the life-channels of the body, it\nflushes the personality with physical force, and maintains and colours the\nillusion that the physical life is the dominant and all-important expression\nof life. In due time, when the spiritual man has begun to take form, the\ncreative force will be drawn off, and become operative in building the body of\nthe spiritual man, just as it has been operative in the building of physical\nbodies, through generation in the natural world.\n\nPerfectly concentrated Meditation on the nature of this force means, first,\nthat rising of the consciousness into the spiritual world, already described,\nwhich gives the one sure foothold for Meditation; and then, from that\nspiritual point of vantage, not only an insight into the creative force, in\nits spiritual and physical aspects, but also a gradually attained control of\nthis wonderful force, which will mean its direction to the body of the\nspiritual man, and its gradual withdrawal from the body of the natural man,\nuntil the over-pressure, so general and such a fruitful source of misery in\nour day, is abated, and purity takes the place of passion. This over pressure,\nwhich is the cause of so many evils and so much of human shame, is an\nabnormal, not a natural, condition. It is primarily due to spiritual\nblindness, to blindness regarding the spiritual man, and ignorance even of his\nexistence; for by this blind ignorance are closed the channels through which,\nwere they open, the creative force could flow into the body of the spiritual\nman, there building up an immortal vesture. There is no cure for blindness,\nwith its consequent over-pressure and attendant misery and shame, but\nspiritual vision, spiritual aspiration, sacrifice, the new birth from above.\nThere is no other way to lighten the burden, to lift the misery and shame from\nhuman life. Therefore, let us follow after sacrifice and aspiration, let us\nseek the light. In this way only shall we gain that insight into the order of\nthe bodily powers, and that mastery of them, which this Sutra implies.\n\n### 30\\. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the centre of force in the\nwell of the throat, there comes the cessation of hunger and thirst.\n\nWe are continuing the study of the bodily powers and centres of force in their\nrelation to the powers and forces of the spiritual man. We have already\nconsidered the dominant power of physical life, the creative power which\nsecures the continuance of physical life; and, further, the manner in which,\nthrough aspiration and sacrifice, it is gradually raised and set to the work\nof upbuilding the body of the spiritual man. We come now to the dominant\npsychic force, the power which manifests itself in speech, and in virtue of\nwhich the voice may carry so much of the personal magnetism, endowing the\norator with a tongue of fire, magical in its power to arouse and rule the\nemotions of his hearers. This emotional power, this distinctively psychical\nforce, is the cause of 'hunger and thirst,' the psychical hunger and thirst\nfor sensations, which is the source of our two-sided life of emotionalism,\nwith its hopes and fears, its expectations and memories, its desires and\nhates. The source of this psychical power, or, perhaps we should say, its\ncentre of activity in the physical body is said to be in the cavity of the\nthroat. Thus, in the Taittiriya Upanishad it is written: 'There is this\nshining ether in the inner being. Therein is the spiritual man, formed through\nthought, immortal, golden. Inward, in the palate, the organ that hangs down\nlike a nipple,--this is the womb of Indra. And there, where the dividing of\nthe hair turns, extending upward to the crown of the head.'\n\nIndra is the name given to the creative power of which we have spoken, and\nwhich, we are told, resides in 'the organ which hangs down like a nipple,\ninward, in the palate.'\n\n### 31\\. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the centre of force in the\nchannel called the 'tortoise-formed,' comes steadfastness.\n\nWe are concerned now with the centre of nervous or psychical force below the\ncavity of the throat, in the chest, in which is felt the sensation of fear;\nthe centre, the disturbance of which sets the heart beating miserably with\ndread, or which produces that sense of terror through which the heart is said\nto stand still.\n\nWhen the truth concerning fear is thoroughly mastered, through spiritual\ninsight into the immortal, fearless life, then this force is perfectly\ncontrolled; there is no more fear, just as, through the control of the psychic\npower which works through the nerve-centre in the throat, there comes a\ncessation of 'hunger and thirst.' Thereafter, these forces, or their spiritual\nprototypes, are turned to the building of the spiritual man.\n\nAlways, it must be remembered, the victory is first a spiritual one; only\nlater does it bring control of the bodily powers.\n\n### 32\\. Through perfectly concentrated Meditation on the light in the head\ncomes the vision of the Masters who have attained.\n\nThe tradition is, that there is a certain centre of force in the head, perhaps\nthe 'pineal gland,' which some of our Western philosophers have supposed to be\nthe dwelling of the soul,-a centre which is, as it were, the door way between\nthe natural and the spiritual man. It is the seat of that better and wiser\nconsciousness behind the outward looking consciousness in the forward part of\nthe head; that better and wiser consciousness of 'the back of the mind,' which\nviews spiritual things, and seeks to impress the spiritual view on the outward\nlooking consciousness in the forward part of the head. It is the spiritual man\nseeking to guide the natural man, seeking to bring the natural man to concern\nhimself with the things of his immortality. This is suggested in the words of\nthe Upanishad already quoted: 'There, where the dividing of the hair turns,\nextending upward to the crown of the head'; all of which may sound very\nfantastical, until one comes to understand it.\n\nIt is said that when this power is fully awakened, it brings a vision of the\ngreat Companions of the spiritual man, those who have already attained,\ncrossing over to the further shore of the sea of death and rebirth. Perhaps it\nis to this divine sight that the Master alluded, who is reported to have said:\n'I counsel you to buy of me eye-salve, that you may see.' It is of this same\nvision of the great Companions, the children of light, that a seer wrote:\n\nThough inland far we be,  \nOur souls have sight of that immortal sea  \nWhich brought us hither,  \nCan in a moment travel thither,  \nAnd see the Children sport upon the shore  \nAnd hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.\n\n### 33\\. Or through the divining power of tuition he knows all things.\n\nThis is really the supplement, the spiritual side, of the Sutra just\ntranslated. Step by step, as the better consciousness, the spiritual view,\ngains force in the back of the mind, so, in the same measure, the spiritual\nman is gaining the power to see: learning to open the spiritual eyes. When the\neyes are fully opened, the spiritual man beholds the great Companions standing\nabout him; he has begun to 'know all things.'\n\nThis divining power of intuition is the power which lies above and behind the\nso-called rational mind; the rational mind formulates a question and lays it\nbefore the intuition, which gives a real answer, often immediately distorted\nby the rational mind, yet always embodying a kernel of truth. It is by this\nprocess, through which the rational mind brings questions to the intuition for\nsolution, that the truths of science are reached, the flashes of discovery and\ngenius. But this higher power need not work in subordination to the so-called\nrational mind, it may act directly, as full illumination, 'the vision and the\nfaculty divine.'\n\n### 34 By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the heart, the interior being,\ncomes the knowledge of consciousness.\n\nThe heart here seems to mean, as it so often. does in the Upanishads, the\ninterior, spiritual nature, the consciousness of the spiritual man, which is\nrelated to the heart, and to the wisdom of the heart. By steadily seeking\nafter, and finding, the consciousness of the spiritual man, by coming to\nconsciousness as the spiritual man, a perfect knowledge of consciousness will\nbe attained. For the consciousness of the spiritual man has this divine\nquality: while being and remaining a truly individual consciousness, it at the\nsame time flows over, as it were, and blends with the Divine Consciousness\nabove and about it, the consciousness of the great Companions; and by showing\nitself to be one with the Divine Consciousness, it reveals the nature of all\nconsciousness, the secret that all consciousness is One and Divine.\n\n### 35\\. The personal self seeks to feast on life, through a failure to\nperceive the distinction between the personal self and the spiritual man. All\npersonal experience really exists for the sake of another: namely, the\nspiritual man.\n\n### By perfectly concentrated Meditation on experience for the sake of the\nSelf, comes a knowledge of the spiritual man.\n\nThe divine ray of the Higher Self, which is eternal, impersonal and abstract,\ndescends into life, and forms a personality, which, through the stress and\nstorm of life, is hammered into a definite and concrete self-conscious\nindividuality. The problem is, to blend these two powers, taking the eternal\nand spiritual being of the first, and blending with it, transferring into it,\nthe self-conscious individuality of the second; and thus bringing to life a\nthird being, the spiritual man, who is heir to the immortality of his father,\nthe Higher Self, and yet has the self-conscious, concrete individuality of his\nother parent, the personal self. This is the true immaculate conception, the\nnew birth from above, 'conceived of the Holy Spirit.' Of this new birth it is\nsaid: 'that which is born of the Spirit is spirit; ye must be born again.'\n\nRightly understood, therefore, the whole life of the personal man is for\nanother, not for himself. He exists only to render his very life and all his\nexperience for the building up of the spiritual man. Only through failure to\nsee this, does he seek enjoyment for himself, seek to secure the feasts of\nlife for himself; not understanding that he must live for the other, live\nsacrificially, offering both feasts and his very being on the altar; giving\nhimself as a contribution for the building of the spiritual man. When he does\nunderstand this, and lives for the Higher Self, setting his heart and thought\non the Higher Self, then his sacrifice bears divine fruit, the spiritual man\nis built up, consciousness awakes in him, and he comes fully into being as a\ndivine and immortal individuality.\n\n### 36\\. Thereupon are born the divine power of intuition, and the hearing,\nthe touch, the vision, the taste and the power of smell of the spiritual man.\n\nWhen, in virtue of the perpetual sacrifice of the personal man, daily and\nhourly giving his life for his divine brother the spiritual man, and through\nthe radiance ever pouring down from the Higher Self, eternal in the Heavens,\nthe spiritual man comes to birth,--there awake in him those powers whose\nphysical counterparts we know in the personal man. The spiritual man begins to\nsee, to hear, to touch, to taste. And, besides the senses of the spiritual\nman, there awakes his mind, that divine counterpart of the mind of the\nphysical man, the power of direct and immediate knowledge, the power of\nspiritual intuition, of divination. This power, as we have seen, owes its\nvirtue to the unity, the continuity, of consciousness, whereby whatever is\nknown to any consciousness, is knowable by any other consciousness. Thus the\nconsciousness of the spiritual man, who lives above our narrow barriers of\nseparateness, is in intimate touch with the consciousness of the great\nCompanions, and can draw on that vast reservoir for all real needs. Thus\narises within the spiritual man that certain knowledge which is called\nintuition, divination, illumination.\n\n### 37\\. These powers stand in contradistinction to the highest spiritual\nvision. In manifestation they are called magical powers.\n\nThe divine man is destined to supersede the spiritual man, as the spiritual\nman supersedes the natural man. Then the disciple becomes a Master. The opened\npowers of tile spiritual man, spiritual vision, hearing, and touch, stand,\ntherefore, in contradistinction to the higher divine power above them, and\nmust in no wise be regarded as the end of the way, for the path has no end,\nbut rises ever to higher and higher glories; the soul's growth and splendour\nhave no limit. So that, if the spiritual powers we have been considering are\nregarded as in any sense final, they are a hindrance, a barrier to the far\nhigher powers of the divine man. But viewed from below, from the standpoint of\nnormal physical experience, they are powers truly magical; as the powers\nnatural to a four-dimensional being will appear magical to a three-dimensional\nbeing.\n\n### 38\\. Through the weakening of the causes of bondage, and by learning the\nmethod of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other body.\n\nIn due time, after the spiritual man has been formed and grown stable through\nthe forces and virtues already enumerated, and after the senses of the\nspiritual man have awaked, there comes the transfer of the dominant\nconsciousness, the sense of individuality, from the physical to the spiritual\nman. Thereafter the physical man is felt to be a secondary, a subordinate, an\ninstrument through whom the spiritual man works; and the spiritual man is felt\nto be the real individuality. This is, in a sense, the attainment to full\nsalvation and immortal life; yet it is not the final goal or resting place,\nbut only the beginning of the greater way.\n\nThe means for this transfer are described as the weakening of the causes of\nbondage, and an understanding of the method of passing from the one\nconsciousness to the other. The first may also be described as detach meet,\nand comes from the conquest of the delusion that the personal self is the real\nman. When that delusion abates and is held in check, the finer consciousness\nof the spiritual man begins to shine in the background of the mind. The\ntransfer of the sense of individuality to this finer consciousness, and thus\nto the spiritual man, then becomes a matter of recollection, of attention;\nprimarily, a matter of taking a deeper interest in the life and doings of the\nspiritual man, than in the pleasures or occupations of the personality.\nTherefore it is said: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where\nmoth and rust cloth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but\nlay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust cloth\ncorrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your\ntreasure is, there will your heart be also.'\n\n### 39\\. Through mastery of the upward-life comes freedom from the dangers of\nwater, morass, and thorny places, and the power of ascension is gained.\n\nHere is one of the sentences, so characteristic of this author, and, indeed,\nof the Eastern spirit, in which there is an obvious exterior meaning, and,\nwithin this, a clear interior meaning, not quite so obvious, but far more\nvital.\n\nThe surface meaning is, that by mastery of a certain power, called here the\nupward-life, and akin to levitation, there comes the ability to walk on water,\nor to pass over thorny places without wounding the feet.\n\nBut there is a deeper meaning. When we speak of the disciple's path as a path\nof thorns, we use a symbol; and the same symbol is used here. The upward-life\nmeans something more than the power, often manifested in abnormal psychical\nexperiences, of levitating the physical body, or near-by physical objects. It\nmeans the strong power of aspiration, of upward will, which first builds, and\nthen awakes the spiritual man, and finally transfers the conscious\nindividuality to him; for it is he who passes safely over the waters of death\nand rebirth, and is not pierced by the thorns in the path. Therefore it is\nsaid that he who would tread the path of power must look for a home in the\nair, and afterwards in the ether.\n\nOf the upward-life, this is written in the Katha Upanishad: 'A hundred and one\nare the heart's channels; of these one passes to the crown. Going up this, he\ncomes to the immortal.' This is the power of ascension spoken of in the Sutra.\n\n### 40\\. By mastery of the binding-life comes radiance.\n\nIn the Upanishads, it is said that this binding-life unites the upward-life to\nthe downward-life, and these lives have their analogies in the 'vital breaths'\nin the body. The thought in the text seems to be, that, when the personality\nis brought thoroughly under control of the spiritual man, through the life-\ncurrents which bind them together, the personality is endowed with a new\nforce, a strong personal magnetism, one might call it, such as is often an\nappanage of genius.\n\nBut the text seems to mean more than this and to have in view the 'vesture of\nthe colour of the sun' attributed by the Upanishads to the spiritual man; that\nvesture which a disciple has thus described: 'The Lord shall change our vile\nbody, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body'; perhaps 'body of\nradiance' would better translate the Greek.\n\nIn both these passages, the teaching seems to be, that the body of the full-\ngrown spiritual man is radiant or luminous,--for those at least, who have\nanointed their eyes with eye-salve, so that they see.\n\n### 41\\. From perfectly concentrated Meditation on the correlation of hearing\nand the ether, comes the power of spiritual hearing.\n\nPhysical sound, we are told, is carried by the air, or by water, iron, or some\nmedium on the same plane of substance. But then is a finer hearing, whose\nmedium of transmission would seem to be the ether; perhaps no that ether which\ncarries light, heat and magnetic waves, but, it may be, the far finer ether\nthrough which the power of gravity works. For, while light or heat or magnetic\nwaves, travelling from the sun to the earth, take eight minutes for the\njourney, it is mathematically certain that the pull of gravitation does not\ntake as much as eight seconds, or even the eighth of a second. The pull of\ngravitation travels, it would seem 'as quick as thought'; so it may well be\nthat, in thought transference or telepathy, the thoughts travel by the same\nway, carried by the same 'thought-swift' medium.\n\nThe transfer of a word by telepathy is the simplest and earliest form of the\n'divine hearing' of the spiritual man; as that power grows, and as, through\nperfectly concentrated Meditation, the spiritual man comes into more complete\nmastery of it, he grows able to hear and clearly distinguish the speech of the\ngreat Companions, who counsel and comfort him on his way. They may speak to\nhim either in wordless thoughts, or in perfectly definite words and sentences.\n\n### 42\\. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the correlation of the body\nwith the ether, and by thinking of it as light as thistle-down, will come the\npower to traverse the ether.\n\nIt has been said that he who would tread the path of power must look for a\nhome in the air, and afterwards in the ether. This would seem to mean, besides\nthe constant injunction to detachment, that he must be prepared to inhabit\nfirst a psychic, and then an etheric body; the former being the body of\ndreams; the latter, the body of the spiritual man, when he wakes up on the\nother side of dreamland. The gradual accustoming of the consciousness to its\nnew etheric vesture, its gradual acclimatization, so to speak, in the etheric\nbody of the spiritual man, is what our text seems to contemplate.\n\n### 43\\. When that condition of consciousness s reached, which is far-reaching\nand not confined to the body, which is outside the body and not conditioned by\nit, then the veil which conceals the light is worn away.\n\nPerhaps the best comment on this is afforded by the words of Paul: 'I knew a\nman in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell;\nor whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such a one caught up\nto the third heaven. And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of\nthe body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) how that he was caught up into\nparadise, and heard unspeakable [or, unspoken] words, which it is not lawful\nfor a man to utter.'\n\nThe condition is, briefly, that of the awakened spiritual man, who sees and\nhears beyond the veil.\n\n### 44\\. Mastery of the elements comes from perfectly concentrated Meditation\non their five forms: the gross, the elemental, the subtle, the inherent, the\npurposive.\n\nThese five forms are analogous to those recognized by modern physics: solid,\nliquid, gaseous, radiant and ionic. When the piercing vision of the awakened\nspiritual man is directed to the forms of matter, from within, as it were,\nfrom behind the scenes, then perfect mastery over the 'beggarly elements' is\nattained. This is, perhaps, equivalent to the injunction: 'Inquire of the\nearth, the air, and the water, of the secrets they hold for you. The\ndevelopment of your inner senses will enable you to do this.'\n\n### 45\\. Thereupon will come the manifestation of the atomic and other powers,\nwhich are the endowment of the body, together with its unassailable force.\n\nThe body in question is, of course, the etheric body of the spiritual man. He\nis said to possess eight powers: the atomic, the power of assimilating himself\nwith the nature of the atom, which will, perhaps, involve the power to\ndisintegrate material forms; the power of levitation; the power of limitless\nextension; the power of boundless reach, so that, as the commentator says, 'he\ncan touch the moon with the tip of his finger'; the power to accomplish his\nwill; the power of gravitation, the correlative of levitation; the power of\ncommand; the power of creative will. These are the endowments of the spiritual\nman. Further, the spiritual body is unassailable. Fire burns it not, water\nwets it not, the sword cleaves it not, dry winds parch it not. And, it is\nsaid, the spiritual man can impart something of this quality and temper to his\nbodily vesture.\n\n### 46\\. Shapeliness, beauty, force, the temper of the diamond: these are the\nendowments of that body.\n\nThe spiritual man is shapely, beautiful strong, firm as the diamond. Therefore\nit is written: 'These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto\na flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass: He that overcometh and\nkeepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: and\nhe shall rule them with a rod of iron; and I will give him the morning star.'\n\n### 47\\. Mastery over the powers of perception and action comes through\nperfectly concentrated Meditation on their fivefold forms; namely, their power\nto grasp their distinctive nature, the element of self-consciousness in them,\ntheir inherence, and their purposiveness.\n\nTake, for example, sight. This possesses, first, the power to grasp,\napprehend, perceive; second, it has its distinctive form of perception; that\nis, visual perception; third, it always carries with its operations self-\nconsciousness, the thought: 'I perceive'; fourth sight has the power of\nextension through the whole field of vision, even to the utmost star; fifth,\nit is used for the purposes of the Seer. So with the other senses. Perfectly\nconcentrated Meditation on each sense, a viewing it from behind and within, as\nis possible for the spiritual man, brings a mastery of the scope and true\ncharacter of each sense, and of the world on which they report collectively.\n\n### 48\\. Thence comes the power swift as thought, independent of instruments,\nand the mastery over matter.\n\nWe are further enumerating the endowments of the spiritual man. Among these is\nthe power to traverse space with the swiftness of thought, so that whatever\nplace the spiritual man thinks of, to that he goes, in that place he already\nis. Thought has now become his means of locomotion. He is, therefore,\nindependent of instruments, and can bring his force to bear directly, wherever\nhe wills.\n\n### 49\\. When the spiritual man is perfectly disentangled from the psychic\nbody, he attains to mastery over all things and to a knowledge of all.\n\nThe spiritual man is enmeshed in the web of the emotions; desire, fear,\nambition, passion; and impeded by the mental forms of separateness and\nmaterialism. When these meshes are sundered, these obstacles completely\novercome, then the spiritual man stands forth in his own wide world, strong,\nmighty, wise. He uses divine powers, with a divine scope and energy, working\ntogether with divine Companions. To such a one it is said: 'Thou art now a\ndisciple, able to stand, able to hear, able to see, able to speak, thou hast\nconquered desire and attained to self-knowledge, thou hast seen thy soul in\nits bloom and recognized it, and heard the voice of the silence.'\n\n### 50\\. By absence of all self-indulgence at this point, when the seeds of\nbondage to sorrow are destroyed, pure spiritual being is attained.\n\nThe seeking of indulgence for the personal self, whether through passion or\nambition, sows the seed of future sorrow. For this self indulgence of the\npersonality is a double sin against the real; a sin against the cleanness of\nlife, and a sin against the universal being, which permits no exclusive\nparticular good, since, in the real, all spiritual possessions are held in\ncommon. This twofold sin brings its reacting punishment, its confining bondage\nto sorrow. But ceasing from self-indulgence brings purity, liberation,\nspiritual life.\n\n### 51\\. There should be complete overcoming of allurement or pride in the\ninvitations of the different realms of life, lest attachment to things evil\narise once more.\n\nThe commentator tells us that disciples, seekers for union, are of four\ndegrees: first, those who are entering the path; second, those who are in the\nrealm of allurements; third, those who have won the victory over matter and\nthe senses; fourth, those who stand firm in pure spiritual life. To the\nsecond, especially, the caution in the text is addressed. More modern teachers\nwould express the same truth by a warning against the delusions and\nfascinations of the psychic realm, which open around the disciple, as he\nbreaks through into the unseen worlds. These are the dangers of the anteroom.\nSafety lies in passing on swiftly into the inner chamber. 'Him that overcometh\nwill I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out.'\n\n### 52\\. From perfectly concentrated Meditation on the divisions of time and\ntheir succession comes that wisdom which is born of discernment.\n\nThe Upanishads say of the liberated that 'he has passed beyond the triad of\ntime'; he no longer sees life as projected into past, present and future,\nsince these are forms of the mind; but beholds all things spread out in the\nquiet light of the Eternal. This would seem to be the same thought, and to\npoint to that clear-eyed spiritual perception which is above time; that wisdom\nborn of the unveiling of Time's delusion. Then shall the disciple live neither\nin the present nor the future, but in the Eternal.\n\n### 53\\. Hence comes discernment between things which are of like nature, not\ndistinguished by difference of kind, character or position.\n\nHere, as also in the preceding Sutra, we are close to the doctrine that\ndistinctions of order, time and space are creations of the mind; the threefold\nprism through which the real object appears to us distorted and refracted.\nWhen the prism is withdrawn, the object returns to its primal unity, no longer\ndistinguishable by the mind, yet clearly knowable by that high power of\nspiritual discernment, of illumination, which is above the mind.\n\n### 54\\. The wisdom which is born of discernment is starlike; it discerns all\nthings, and all conditions of things, it discerns without succession:\nsimultaneously.\n\nThat wisdom, that intuitive, divining power is starlike, says the commentator,\nbecause it shines with its own light, because it rises on high, and illumines\nall things. Nought is hid from it, whether things past, things present, or\nthings to come; for it is beyond the threefold form of time, so that all\nthings are spread before it together, in the single light of the divine. This\npower has been beautifully described by Columba: 'Some there are, though very\nfew, to whom Divine grace has granted this: that they can clearly and most\ndistinctly see, at one and the same moment, as though under one ray of the\nsun, even the entire circuit of the whole world with its surroundings of ocean\nand sky, the inmost part of their mind being marvellously enlarged.'\n\n### 55\\. When the vesture and the spiritual man are alike pure, then perfect\nspiritual life is attained.\n\nThe vesture, says the commentator, must first be washed pure of all stains of\npassion and darkness, and the seeds of future sorrow must be burned up\nutterly. Then, both the vesture and the wearer of the vesture being alike\npure, the spiritual man enters into perfect spiritual life.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Introduction to Book IV](ysp07.htm)\n\n"
