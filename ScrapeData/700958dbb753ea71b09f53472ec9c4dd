These\nSutras give some general information about the performance of sacrifices, and\nmay prove useful to the students both of the _S_ rauta and the G _ri_ hya\nsacrifices. Paribhasha is defined as a general rule or definition applicable\nthroughout a whole system, and more binding than any particular rule. How well\nthis sense of paribhasha was understood in India, we may see from a passage in\nthe _S_ i _s_ upalavadha XVI, 80:\n\nParita _h_ pramitaksharapi sarva _m_  \nvishayam praptavati gata pratish _th_ am  \nna khalu pratihanyate kuta _s_ _k_ it  \nparibhasheva gariyasi yada _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a.\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Whose (the king's) command, though brief, having\nreached the whole kingdom round about and obtained authority, is never\ndefeated, being of the highest weight, like a Paribhasha.'\n\nThese Paribhashas are a very characteristic invention of ancient Indian\nauthors, particularly during the Sutra period. We find them as early as the\nAnukrama _n_ is, and even at that early time they had been elaborated with\nmany purely technical contrivances. Thus we are told in the Index to the _Ri_\ng-veda that, as a general rule, if no deity is mentioned in the index of the\nhymns, Indra must be supposed to be the deity addressed; when no metre is\nmentioned, the metre must be understood to be the Trish _t_ ubh; at the\nbeginning of each Ma _n_ _d_ ala the hymns must be taken to be addressed to\nAgni, till we come to hymns distinctly addressed to Indra. Now it is clear\nthat in this case these Paribhashas or general instructions must have been\nlaid down\n\np. 312\n\nbefore the whole work was carried out. The same applies to other Paribhashas,\nsuch as those of the metrical Sutras, but I feel more doubtful as to the\nParibhashas in the grammatical Sutras of Pa _n_ ini. To judge from the\nParibhashendu _s_ ekhara, it would seem that the Paribhasha-sutras to Pa _n_\nini's grammar also had been settled before a single Sutra of Pa _n_ ini was\ncomposed, and yet it seems almost incredible that this gigantic web of Sutras\nshould have been woven on so complicated a warp. This question ought to be\nsettled once for all, as it would throw considerable light on the workmanship\nof Pa _n_ ini's Sutras, and there is no one better qualified to settle it for\nus than the learned editor of the Paribhashendu _s_ ekhara. It is different\nwith our Paribhashas. There is no necessity to suppose that they were worked\nout first, before the Sutras were composed. They look more like useful\ngeneralisations than like indispensable preliminary instructions. They give us\na general idea of the sacrifice, and inculcate rules that ought to be observed\nthroughout. But I doubt whether they are as essential for enabling the priest\nto carry out the instructions of the Sutras in performing a sacrifice as the\ngrammatical paribhashas are in carrying out the grammatical rules of Pa _n_\nini.\n\nThe \xc3\x82pastamba-sutras for which our Paribhashas are intended are said to have\ncomprised thirty Pra _s_ nas (see Burnell, Catalogue, p. 19, and p. xxix in\nProfessor Oldenberg's Introduction). Burnell mentions that sometimes two Pra\n_s_ nas, treating of the Pait _ri_ medhika rites, were counted as the thirty-\nfirst and thirty-second of the whole work. Of these thirty Pra _s_ nas fifteen\nhave been edited with Rudradatta's commentary by Professor Garbe in the\nBibliotheca Indica, 1882-1885. Rudradatta's commentary does not seem to have\nextended beyond the fifteenth Pra _s_ na; some authorities, however, suppose\nthat Haradatta, to whom commentaries on the later Pra _s_ nas are ascribed,\nwas only another name for Rudradatta. According to _K_ aun _d_ appa's\nPrayogaratnamala (see Burnell, Classified Index, I, p. 17 a), the Paribhasha-\nsutras formed part of the twenty-fourth Pra _s_ na ( _k_ aturvi _m_ _s_ e tata\n_h_ pra _s_ ne nyayapravarahautrakam).\n\np. 313\n\n[paragraph continues] Here Nyaya in the sense of method, way, plan, seems to\nstand for Paribhasha. Another name is Samanya-sutra (see Burnell, Classified\nIndex, p. 15 b, where it is mentioned as \xc2\xa7 4 of Pra _s_ na XXIV). Kau _n_ _d_\nappa _k_ arya himself, who is said to have been minister of Virabhupati, the\nson of the famous king Bukka of Vi _g_ ayanagara, begins his work with a\nparibhasha-pari _k_ _kh_ eda.\n\nI published a German translation of these Sutras with notes many years ago, in\nthe Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, 1855. I here give\nthe same translation, but I have shortened the notes and compared the\ntranslation once more with the MSS.\n\nThe principal MSS. used are MS. I.O.L. 1676 b, 259, and 1127. MS. 1676 b, now\n308, is described in Professor Eggeling's Catalogue of the Sanskrit MSS. in\nthe Library of the India Office, vol. i, p. 58 b. It is written in Devanagari,\ncontains thirty leaves, and is called at the end iti _S_ rikapardina bhashye\nuddh _ri_ tasaram paribhashapa _t_ alam. MS. 259, now 309, contains twenty-\nseven leaves in Devanagari, and is called at the end iti Kapardisvami-bhashye\nparibhashapa _t_ alam. MS. 1127, now 307, in Devanagari, is dated Samvat 1691,\n_S_ aka 1556, and contains on 220 leaves portions of Talav _ri_ ndanivasin's\nmanual, the \xc3\x82pastambasutra-prayoga-v _ri_ tti, and on pp. 75 a-116 a\nKapardisvamin's commentary on \xc3\x82pastamba's Paribhashapa _t_ alam. Burnell\nmentions another copy of this work in his Classified Index, I, p. 17 b, and he\nstates (Catalogue, p. 24) that, according to tradition, the author was a\nnative of Southern India, called A _n_ _d_ appi _l_ _l_ ai, and that talav\n_ri_ nda or talav _ri_ nta is a translation of the Tamil panai-kka _t_ u, a\nvery common name for villages among palmyra trees (panai = palmyra, ka _t_ u =\nforest).\n\nWhile preparing my new translation for the Press, I received a printed edition\nof the text and commentary published by _S_ ri Satyavratasama _s_ ramibha _t_\n_t_ a _k_ arya in his valuable Journal, the Usha, beginning in the eighth\nfasciculus. He gives also a Bengali translation, and some commentaries in the\nsame language, which have proved useful in certain difficult passages.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sutras 1-25](sbe30119.htm)\n\n"
