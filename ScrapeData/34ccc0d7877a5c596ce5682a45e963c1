The reason why he subsequently prepares a cake\nis this. Rice and barley, truly, are the sacrificial essence of all animals\n(victims) 3; with that same essence he now completes that (victim) and makes\nit whole. This is why he subsequently prepares a sacrificial cake.\n\n3:8:3:22\\. And why he proceeds with that cake after performing (offering) with\nthe omentum is this. It is from the middle (of the victim) that this omentum\nis pulled out, and from the middle he now completes that (victim) by means of\nthat sacrificial essence and makes it whole; therefore he proceeds with that\ncake after performing with the omentum. The relation of\n\np. 200\n\nthis (cake to the animal offering), indeed, is one and the same everywhere;\nthat cake is prepared after (and supplementary to) a victim.\n\n3:8:3:33\\. Thereupon he cuts up the victim: \'Move thrice 1, and make the heart\nthe uppermost of the thrice-moved!\' thus (he says to the slaughterer), for\nthreefold is the sacrifice.\n\n3:8:3:44\\. He then instructs the slaughterer: \'If one ask thee, "Is the\nsacrificial food cooked, O _S_ amitar?" say thou only "Cooked!" not "Cooked,\nreverend sir!" nor "Cooked, forsooth!"\'\n\np. 201\n\n3:8:3:55\\. Having then taken clotted ghee with the _g_ uhu, the Adhvaryu,\nstepping up (from the altar) to (the _S_ amitra), asks, \'Is the sacrificial\nfood cooked, O _S_ amitar?\' \'Cooked,\' he says. \'That is of the gods,\' says the\nAdhvaryu in a low voice.\n\n3:8:3:66\\. The reason why he asks is this. Cooked, forsooth, not uncooked\n(must be) the gods\' food; and the _S_ amit _ri_ indeed knows whether it is\ncooked or uncooked.\n\n3:8:3:77\\. And again, why he asks. \'I will perform with cooked (food),\' so he\nthinks; and if that sacrificial food be uncooked, it is yet cooked food for\nthe gods, and is cooked as regards the Sacrificer; and the Adhvaryu is\nguiltless; on the slaughterer that guilt lies. Thrice he asks, for threefold\nis the sacrifice. And as to his saying, \'That is of the gods,\' that which is\ncooked, indeed, belongs to the gods; therefore he says, \'That is of the gods.\'\n\n3:8:3:88\\. The heart he bastes (with clotted ghee) first of all; for the heart\nis the self (soul), the mind; and the clotted ghee is the breath; he thus puts\nthe breath into its (the victim\'s) self, into its mind; and thus it verily\nbecomes the living food of the gods, and immortal for the immortals.\n\n3:8:3:99\\. He bastes it with (Va _g_. S. VI, 18), \'May thy mind unite with the\nmind; thy breath with the breath!\' He utters no Svaha (\'hail\'), for this is\nnot an oblation. They remove the victim (from the cooking-fire) 1.\n\n3:8:3:1010\\. \'They take it along the back of the pit, and\n\np. 202\n\nbetween the sacrificial stake and the (\xc3\x82havaniya) fire. The reason why, though\nit is cooked, they do not take it across the middle (of the altar), as they\ntake other sacrificial dishes, is \'lest they should bring the sacrifice in the\nmiddle in connection with that which is cut up by limbs and mangled.\' And why\nthey do not take it outside (the altar) in front of the stake, is that they\nwould thereby put it outside the sacrifice: therefore they take (the flesh)\nalong between the stake and the fire. When they have put it down south (of the\nfire), the Pratiprasthat _ri_ cuts off (the portions). There are Plaksha\nbranches 1 (Ficus Infectoria) by way of an upper barhis (covering of altar);\nthereon he cuts. The reason why there are Plaksha branches by way of an upper\nbarhis is this.\n\n3:8:3:1111\\. For when the gods, at first, seized an animal to sacrifice),\nTvash _t_ _ri_ first spat upon its head, thinking, \'Surely, thus they will not\ntouch it!\' for animals belong to Tvash _t_ _ri_. That (spittle became) the\nbrain in the head and the marrow in the neck-bone 2: hence that (substance) is\nlike spittle, for Tvash _t_ _ri_ spat it. Let him therefore not eat that,\nsince it was spitten by Tvash _t_ _ri_.\n\n3:8:3:1212\\. Its sacrificial essence flowed down and there a tree sprang up.\nThe gods beheld it; wherefore it (was called) \'prakhya\' (visible), for\n\'plaksha,\'\n\np. 203\n\ndoubtless, is the same as \'prakhya.\' With that same sacrificial essence he now\ncompletes it (the victim), and makes it whole: hence there are Plaksha\nbranches as an upper covering.\n\n3:8:3:1313\\. He then makes an \'underlayer\' of ghee both in the _g_ uhu and the\nupabh _ri_ t, and in the vasahomahavani 1, and the samavattadhani 2; and puts\na piece of gold 3 both in the _g_ uhu and the upabh _ri_ t.\n\n3:8:3:1414\\. Thereupon he addresses (the Hot _ri_ ) for the recitation on the\nhavis to the manota deity 4. The reason why he addresses him for the\nrecitation on the havis to the manota deity is this. All the deities draw nigh\nto the victim while it is immolated, thinking, \'My name he will choose, my\nname he will choose!\' for the animal victim is sacrificial food for all\ndeities. The minds (manas), then, of all those deities are, fixed upon (ota)\nthat victim; those (minds of theirs) he thereby satisfies, and thus the minds\nof the gods have not drawn nigh in vain. For this reason he addresses him for\nthe recitation on the havis to the manota deity.\n\np. 204\n\n3:8:3:1515\\. He first makes a portion of the heart 1. The reason why he first\nmakes a portion of the heart which is in the middle, is that the heart is the\nbreath, since it is from there that this breath moves upward 2; and the animal\nis breath, for only so long does the animal (live) as it breathes with the\nbreath; but when the breath departs from it, it lies there useless, even (as)\na block of wood.\n\n3:8:3:1616\\. The heart, then, is the animal; thus he first makes a portion of\nits very self (or soul). And, accordingly, if any portion were omitted, he\nneed not heed this, since it is of his entire animal victim that the first\nportion is made which is made of the heart. He therefore first makes a portion\nof the heart, that being in the middle. Thereupon according to the proper\norder.\n\n3:8:3:1717\\. Then of the tongue, for that stands out from its fore-part. Then\nof the breast, for that also (stands out) therefrom 3. Then of the\nsimultaneously moving (left) fore-foot 4. Then of the flanks. Then of the\nliver. Then of the kidneys.\n\n3:8:3:1818\\. The hind-part he divides into three parts; the broad piece (he\nreserves) for the by-offerings 5; the middle one he cuts into the guhu after\ndividing it in two; the narrow piece (he reserves) for the\n\np. 205\n\ntrya\xe1\xb9\x85ga 1. Then of the simultaneously moving (right) haunch 2. This much,\nthen, he cuts into the _g_ uhu.\n\n3:8:3:1919\\. Then into the upabh _ri_ t, he makes a portion of the upper part\nof the fore-foot belonging to the trya\xe1\xb9\x85ga (viz. the right one); of the (narrow\npiece of the) hind-part, after dividing it in two; and of the haunch belonging\nto the trya\xe1\xb9\x85ga (viz. the left). Thereupon he puts two pieces of gold on (the\nflesh oblations in the spoons) and pours ghee thereon.\n\n3:8:3:2020\\. He then takes the oblation of gravy 3 with (Va _g_. S. VI, 18),\n\'Thou art trembling,\' for quivering, as it were, is the broth: hence he says,\n\'Thou art trembling;\'--\'May Agni prepare 4 thee!\' for the fire does indeed\ncook it: hence he says, \'May Agni prepare thee!\'--\'The waters have washed thee\ntogether,\' for the water indeed gathers together that (fat) juice from the\nlimbs: hence he says, \'The waters have washed thee together.\'\n\n3:8:3:2121\\. \'For the sweeping of the wind--thee!\' for verily yonder blower\nsweeps along the air, and for the air he takes it: hence he says, \'For the\nsweeping of the wind (I take) thee.\'\n\n3:8:3:2222\\. \'For the speed of Pushan,\'--Pushan\'s speed, forsooth, is yonder\n(wind) 5, and for that he takes it: hence he says, \'For the speed of Pushan.\'\n\np. 206\n\n3:8:3:2323\\. \'From the hot vapour may totter--;\' the hot vapour, namely, is\nyonder (wind), and for that he takes it: hence he says, \'From the hot vapour\nmay totter--.\' Thereupon he bastes it twice with ghee above.\n\n3:8:3:2424\\. He then mixes it either with the crooked knife or with the\nchopping-knife 1, with \'--Confounded hatred 2!\' whereby he chases away from\nhere those evil spirits, the Rakshas.\n\n3:8:3:2525\\. The broth which is left he pours into the Samavattadhani, and\ntherein he throws the heart, tongue, breast, the broad piece (of the back\npart), the kidneys, and the rectum. He then bastes it twice with ghee above.\n\n3:8:3:2626\\. The reason why there is a piece of gold on each side is this.\nWhen they offer up the victim in the fire, they slay it, and gold means\nimmortal life: thereby then it rests in immortal life; and so it rises from\nhence, and so it lives. This is why there is a piece of gold on each side.\n\n3:8:3:2727\\. And because he cuts crossways,--of the left fore-foot and the\nright haunch; and of the right forefoot and the left haunch,--therefore this\nanimal draws forward its feet crossways. But were he to cut straight on, this\nanimal would draw forward its feet (of the same side) simultaneously:\ntherefore he cuts crossways. Then as to why he does not make cuttings of the\nhead, nor the shoulders, nor the neck, nor the hind-thighs.\n\np. 207\n\n3:8:3:2828\\. Now the Asuras, in the beginning, seized a victim. The gods, from\nfear, did not go near it 1. The Earth 2 then said unto them, \'Heed ye not\nthis: I will myself be an eye-witness thereof, in whatsoever manner they will\nperform this (offering).\'\n\n3:8:3:2929\\. She said, \'Only one oblation have they offered, the other they\nhave left over.\' Now that which they left over are these same portions.\nThereupon the gods made over three limbs to (Agni) Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, whence\nthe Trya\xe1\xb9\x85ga oblations. The Asuras then made portions of the head, the\nshoulders, the neck, and the hind-thighs: therefore let him not make portions\nof these. And since Tvash _t_ _ri_ spat upon the neck, therefore let him not\nmake a portion of the neck. Thereupon he says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Recite (the\ninvitatory prayer) to Agni and Soma for the havis of the buck!\' Having called\nfor the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says (to the Maitravaru _n_ a), \'Prompt (the Hot\n_ri_ to recite the offering-prayer 3 for) the havis of the buck to Agni and\nSoma!\' He does not say \'(the havis) made ready:\' when the Soma has been\npressed he says \'made ready.\'\n\n3:8:3:3030\\. In the interval between the two half-verses of the offering-\nprayer he offers the oblation of gravy. It is from out of this that that\nessence (juice) has risen upwards here,--that sap of this earth whereby\ncreatures exist on this side of the sky 4; for the\n\np. 208\n\noblation of gravy is sap, and essence is sap: thus he renders the sap strong\nby means of sap, whence this sap when eaten does not perish.\n\n3:8:3:3131\\. And as to why he offers the oblation of gravy in the interval\nbetween the two half-verses of the offering-prayer,--one half-verse, forsooth,\nis this earth, and the other half-verse is yonder sky. Now between the sky and\nthe earth is the air, and it is to the air that he offers: therefore he offers\nthe oblation of gravy between the two half-verses of the offering-prayer.\n\n3:8:3:3232\\. He offers with (Va _g_. S. VI, 19), \'Drink the ghee, ye drinkers\nof ghee! Drink the gravy, ye drinkers of gravy! thou art the havis of the air,\nHail!\' With this prayer to the All-gods he offers, for the air belongs to the\nAll-gods: because creatures move about here in the air breathing in and\nbreathing out therewith, therefore it belongs to the All-gods. As the Vasha\n_t_ (of the offering-prayer for the meat portions) is pronounced, he offers\nthe portions that are in the _g_ uhu.\n\n3:8:3:3333\\. Thereupon, while taking clotted ghee with the _g_ uhu, he says\n(to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the Lord of the\nforest!\' Having called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says (to the Maitravaru _n_\na), \'Prompt (the Hot _ri_ to recite the offering-prayer) to the lord of the\nforest!\' and offers, as the Vasha _t_ is pronounced 1. The reason why he\noffers to the lord of the forest (the tree) is,--he thereby makes that\nthunderbolt, the sacrificial stake, a sharer (in the sacrifice); and, the lord\nof the forest being Soma 2,\n\np. 209\n\nhe thereby makes the victim to be Soma. And as to his offering (to the tree)\nbetween the two oblations, he thus fills both completely: therefore he offers\nbetween the two oblations.\n\n3:8:3:3434\\. Thereupon, while pouring together the meat portions that are for\nthe upabh _ri_ t, he says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Recite (the invitatory prayer)\nto Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (the maker of good offering)!\' Having called for\nthe _S_ rausha _t_ , he says (to the Maitravaru _n_ a), \'Prompt for Agni Svish\n_t_ ak _ri_ t!\' and offers as the Vasha _t_ is pronounced.\n\n3:8:3:3535\\. With what is left of the offering of gravy, he then sprinkles the\nquarters, with, \'The regions,--the fore-regions,--the by-regions,--the\nintermediate regions,--the upper regions,--to the regions, Hail!\' For the\noffering of gravy is sap: thus he imbues all the regions with sap, and hence\nsap is obtained here on earth in every region.\n\n3:8:3:3636\\. Thereupon he touches (what remains of) the victim 1: now is the\ntime for the touching. And whether he has touched it before, fearing \'those\n(evil spirits) that hover near will tear it about,\' or whether he be not\nafraid 2 of its being torn about, let him in any case now touch (the victim).\n\np. 210\n\n3:8:3:3737\\. [Va _g_. S. VI, 20], \'To Indra belongeth the out-breathing: may\nit attend 1 to every limb! To Indra belongeth the in-breathing: it is attended\nto in every limb.\' Where it has been cut up limb by limb, there he heals it by\nmeans of the out-breathing and in-breathing.--\'O divine Tvash _t_ _ri_ , let\nthine ample (forms) closely unite together, that it be uniform what is of\ndifferent shape:\' whereby he makes it completely enclosed (in its limbs and\nflesh). \'May thy friends, thy father and mother 2, to please thee, joyfully\nwelcome thee going to the gods!\' Thus, having made it whole wherever he has\noffered (a piece of) it, he afterwards unites it firmly, and that body (self)\nof it is complete in yonder world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[199:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_500) The technical name of this cake to Indra and Agni\nis pa _s_ u-puroda _s_ a (animal-cake). The anuvakya and ya _g_ ya for the\nchief oblation, are Rig-veda I, 93, 2 and 6 respectively; for the Svish _t_ ak\n_ri_ t, III, I, 23, and III, 54, 22; Adv. III, 8, 1; 5, 9. For a similar\nperformance, described in detail, see note on III, 2, 5, 22.\n\n[199:3](sbe2633.htm#fr_501) On the sacrificial essence passing successively\nfrom man into the horse, the ox, the goat, and finally into the rice and\nbarley, see I, 2, 3, 6-7.\n\n[200:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_502) The order of proceeding is not quite clear from\nthe context, and seems to have puzzled the later ritualists. From Katy. VI,\n7-8 it would seem that the author of the Sutras means the performance of the\ncake-offering to go on simultaneously with the cutting up of the victim (and\nthe cooking of the portions and roasting of the beast). The comm. on Katy. VI,\n7, 29, however, protests against this arrangement as contrary to the order\nlaid down in the Brahma _n_ a; and insists especially on the \'atha (now)\' at\nthe beginning of this paragraph. This particle is, however, often used in a\nvague sense; as very frequently when, after sketching the chief course of\nperformance, the author turns back to fill in the details. There seems also a\ndifference of opinion as to the exact meaning of the above direction given by\nthe Adhvaryu to the Samitar after (as would seem) the portions have been\ncooked. The commentator on Katy. VI, 8, 1 apparently takes \'tri _h_ pra _k_\nyavaya\' in the sense of \'shake thrice\' or \'turn thrice.\' Saya _n_ a, on the\nother hand, explains it as meaning that the _S_ amit _ri_ is to divide the\nportions into three parts, according to whether they are destined for the\nchief offerings, or the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, or the by-offerings (?). As the\ndirection cannot refer to the taking out of the portions from the cooking-\nvessel (ukha) it would seem that the _S_ amitar is either to move (shake) the\nvessel itself, or to stir the contents, perhaps hereby separating the\nrespective portions. The Ka _n_ va text reads, Tri _h_ pra _k_ yavayad ity\nuttame pra _k_ yava uttamardhe h _ri_ daya _m_ kurutad iti. The heart, when\ndone, is to be removed from the spit and laid on the portions; whereupon the\nAdhvaryu pours ghee on the portions ([paragraph 8](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:8)).\n\n[201:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_503) The Adhvaryu removes the dish northwards from the\nfire, takes the portions out of it, puts them into some kind of basket, and\nperforms \'pra _n_ adana\' ([p. 196](sbe2632.htm#page_196), note\n[3](sbe2632.htm#fn_488)) on them.\n\n[202:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_504) Or, the Plaksha branches with which the altar was\ncovered on the preceding night. See [p. 120](sbe2619.htm#page_120), note\n[3](sbe2619.htm#fn_320). The Ka _n_ va text (as Taitt. S. VI, 3, 10, 2) speaks\nof one Plaksha branch put on the barhis.\n\n[202:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_505) Anuka, of which anukya is the adjective, means\n\'the forepart of the spinal column.\' The Ka _n_ va text reads,--yan mastishko\nyad anuke ma _g_ _g_ a.\n\n[203:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_506) That is, the ladle used (as a substitute for the\n_g_ uhu) for offering the fat-liquor or gravy. See [paragraph\n20](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:20).\n\n[203:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_507) That is, the vessel used for holding the cuttings\n(samavatta) of the i _d_ a; also called i _d_ apatri, see part i, p. 219, note\n3.\n\n[203:3](sbe2633.htm#fr_508) See [p. 198](sbe2632.htm#page_198), note\n[1](sbe2632.htm#fn_493).\n\n[203:4](sbe2633.htm#fr_509) Thereupon he says, \'Recite to the manota (deity)\nthe invitatory prayer for (of) the havis which is being cut in portions\n(havisho \'vadiyamanasya).\' Ka _n_ va text; cf. Ait. Br. II, 10.--While the\nsacrificial portions are being cut into the respective spoons, the Hot _ri_\nrecites the Hymn to Agni, Rig-veda VI, 1, 1-13, beginning, \'Thou, O wondrous\nAgni, the first thinker (manot _ri_ ) of this hymn, wert verily the priest. .\n. .\' From the occurrence of this word manota, the latter has come to be the\ntechnical name both of the hymn itself and of the deity (Agni) to whom it is\nrecited.\n\n[204:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_510) Literally, he makes a cutting of the heart (h _ri_\ndayasya-avadyati), that is to say, he puts the entire heart into the _g_ uhu\nas an offering-portion.\n\n[204:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_511) Etasmad dhy ayam urdhva _h_ pra _n_ a u _k_ _k_\narati, Ka _n_ va rec.\n\n[204:3](sbe2633.htm#fr_512) Or, that (comes) after that (tongue): tad dhi tato\n\'nvak, Ka _n_ va rec.\n\n[204:4](sbe2633.htm#fr_513) According to Katy. VI, 7, 6, it is the foremost\n(or upper) joint (purvana _d_ aka) of the left fore-foot which is taken. The\nKa _n_ va text has simply \'atha dosh _n_ a _h_.\'\n\n[204:5](sbe2633.htm#fr_514) See [III, 8, 4, 9](sbe2634.htm#3:8:4:9) seq.\n\n[205:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_515) Literally, the three-limbs, the technical name of\nthe portion for Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n[205:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_516) For \'athaika _k_ arayai _s_ ro _n_ e _h_ \' the Ka\n_n_ va text reads \'atha&#0769dhyudhasa _h_ _s_ ro _n_ e _h_ ,\' of the hip\nabove the udder.\n\n[205:3](sbe2633.htm#fr_517) Vasa, i.e. the melted fat (and juice) mixed with\nthe water in which the portions have been cooked, and forming a rich gravy,\noffered with the Vasahomahavani.\n\n[205:4](sbe2633.htm#fr_518) Literally, \'mix\'-- _s_ ri, this root being here,\nas usual, confounded with _s_ _ri_ , to cook.\n\n[205:5](sbe2633.htm#fr_519) Esha viva pusha yo \'yam pavata etasma u hi g _ri_\nh _n_ ati, Ka _n_ va recension.\n\n[206:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_520) _S_ asena va par _s_ vena va, Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[206:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_521) This forms part of the preceding formula (as\nsubject to the verb \'may totter\'), though the author seems to separate it\ntherefrom, as does Mahidhara. The meaning of the formula seems to be, \'May the\nenemies perish, confounded by (?) the hot vapour!\'\n\n[207:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_522) The St. Petersburg Dict. takes \'Na-upaveyu _h_ \'\nin the sense of \'they did not fall in therewith; they did not feel inclined\nfor it;\' as above, [III, 7, 3, 3](sbe2629.htm#3:7:3:3). Saya _n_ a explains it\nby \'nopagata _h_ \' (MSS. napagata _h_ ).\n\n[207:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_523) That is, Aditi, according to the Ka _n_ va\nrecension.\n\n[207:3](sbe2633.htm#fr_524) The ya _g_ ya and anuvakya are I, 93, 3 and 7\nrespectively.\n\n[207:4](sbe2633.htm#fr_525) Ito va ayam urdhva u _k_ _kh_ _ri_ to raso yam\nidam ima _h_ pra _g_ a upa _g_ ivanty arvag divo \'sminn antarikshe, Ka _n_ va\nrecension.\n\n[208:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_526) For the formulas used with this oblation, as well\nas the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, see Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. pp. 95-96 notes.\n\n[208:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_527) Or, Soma being a tree (plant).\n\n[209:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_528) This touching takes place either before or after\nthe invocation of I _d_ a (see I, 8, I, I seq.), whereupon the priests and\nsacrificer eat their respective portions; the straight gut being the Agnidh\'s,\nthe part above the udder (adhyndhni) the Hot _ri_ \'s, the kloman (apparently\nthe right lung) the Brahman\'s, the pericardium (? puritat) the Adhvaryu\'s, and\nthe spleen the sacrificer\'s share, while the I _d_ a is eaten by all of them.\n\n[209:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_529) Or perhaps,--And as to his touching it before\nthis, (he did so) fearing lest those (evil spirits) that hover near would tear\nit about; and even if he be not (any longer?) afraid of its being torn about,\nlet him now touch it in any case. The Ka _n_ va text has simply,--p. 210 This\nis the time for touching; but if he think, \'Those standing about here will\nmeddle with it,\' he may also touch it before: but this is certainly the time\nfor touching.\n\n[210:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_530) The St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that\n\'nididhyat\' and \'nidhita\' are probably corruptions of forms from \'dha;\' the\nTaitt. S. (I, 3, 10) having \'ni dedhyat--vi bobhuvat\' instead. Mahidhara also\ntakes \'nididhyat\' from \'dhi\' in the sense of \'dha,\'--\'Indra\'s out-breathing is\ninfused into every limb; Indra\'s in-breathing has been infused into every\nlimb.\' The Ka _n_ va text has \'-nidhita _h_ , -nididhe.\'\n\n[210:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_531) Rather, \'the mothers (or mother) and fathers.\' The\nTaitt. S. separates mata pitara _h_ , \'the mother and the fathers.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 8, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe2634.htm)\n\n'
