I speak concerning him\nwho abides in the heart. This being, the director, dwells in the heart and\ndirects (all creatures). Impelled by that same (being), I move as I am\nordered, like water on a declivity. There is one instructor; there is no\nsecond (different) from him. I speak concerning him who abides in the heart.\nTaught by that instructor, all snakes whatever are ever hated in the world 2.\nThere is one kinsman; there is no second (different) from him. I speak\nconcerning him who abides in the heart. Taught by him kinsmen are possessed of\nkinsmen 3, (and) the seven _Ri_ shis, O son of P _ri_ tha 4! shine in heaven\n5. There\n\np. 282\n\nis one hearer 1; there is no second (different) from him. I speak concerning\nhim who abides in the heart. Living under that instructor, (according to the\nproper mode of) living with an instructor, _S_ akra 2 acquired immortality in\nall worlds. There is one enemy; there is no second (different) from him. I\nspeak concerning him who abides in the heart. Taught by that instructor, all\nsnakes whatever are ever hated in the world 3. On this, too, they relate an\nancient story, (about the) instruction of the snakes, and the gods, and sages,\nby Pra _g_ apati. The gods, and sages, and the snakes, and the demons,\napproaching Pra _g_ apati, said (to him): 'Tell us the highest good.' To them\nwho were inquiring about the highest good, the venerable one said, 'Om 4, the\nBrahman, in a single syllable.' Hearing that, they ran away in (various)\ndirections 5. When they were running. for instruction regarding the self, the\ninclination of the snakes to biting had been already formed. The natural\ninclination of the demons towards ostentatiousness had been formed. The gods\nhad been engaged in gifts, and the great sages in restraint of the senses.\nHaving had one teacher,\n\np. 283\n\nand having been instructed with one word, the snakes, the gods, the sages, and\nthe demons, all engaged in different 1 (pursuits). One hears what is said (to\none) and apprehends it duly; (but even) to one who inquires and extols highly,\nthere is no other instructor 2. And by his counsel does action afterwards take\nplace. The instructor, the learner, the hearer, and the enemy, are always\nwithin the heart. Acting sinfully in the world, he becomes (a man of) sinful\nconduct. Acting virtuously in the world he becomes .(a man of) virtuous\nconduct 3. And he becomes a man of conduct according to his own desire 4, who,\nowing to his desires, is given up to the pleasures of the senses. But he who,\ncasting aside vows 5 and actions, merely adheres to the Brahman, he moving\nabout in the world identifying himself with the Brahman, becomes a Brahma _k_\narin. To him the Brahman itself is the fuel, the Brahman the fire, the Brahman\nhis origin, the Brahman water, the Brahman the instructor. He is rapt in the\n\np. 284\n\nBrahman [1](sbe0839.htm#fn_1361). Such is this subtle life as a Brahma _k_\narin understood by the wise. Understanding it they practised it, being\ninstructed by the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a [2](sbe0839.htm#fn_1362).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[281:1](sbe0838.htm#fr_1351) I. e. the Supreme Being, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\nNilaka _nth_ a connects this with the preceding chapter by saying that this\ndescribes Narayana, who is there mentioned. See _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha\nDharma), Chap. 226, st. 8 (Bombay ed.)\n\n[281:2](sbe0838.htm#fr_1352) The natural feelings of animosity are caused by\nthe Supreme Being within. Such seems to be the meaning. Cf. Gita, pp.\n[128](sbe0820.htm#page_128), [129](sbe0820.htm#page_129). I may remark that Ar\n_g_ una Mi _s_ ra seems to interpret the original words, which we have\nrendered by 'I speak concerning him,' &c., to mean 'I repeat what has been\nsaid by,' &c. This does not seem to me to be satisfactory; and it may be\nadded, too, that Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's interpretation appears in his gloss\nnot on the first verse, about the 'director,' but only on the second, about\nthe instructor.' Hated = full of animosity, Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[281:3](sbe0838.htm#fr_1353) I. e. the feeling of kinsmanship arises from his\ninspiration.\n\n[281:4](sbe0838.htm#fr_1354) The poet seems to be nodding here, as this\nexpression cannot form part of the Brahma _n_ a's speech to his wife.\n\n[281:5](sbe0838.htm#fr_1355) The seven sages are always mentioned together,\nand may well be spoken of as types of the feeling of kinship.\n\n[282:1](sbe0838.htm#fr_1356) Nilaka _nth_ a takes this to mean pupil, but it\nis difficult to reconcile that with the rest of the passage. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra renders it by 'the destroyer of every one's doubts.' For that, it will be\nnecessary to take the word as a form of the causative, and not the simple root\n_s_ ru, to hear. But see, too, p. 283, 'the instructor . . . the hearer.'\n\n[282:2](sbe0838.htm#fr_1357) Cf. Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p.\n152](sbe0823.htm#page_152), note  [1](sbe0823.htm#fn_618).\n\n[282:3](sbe0838.htm#fr_1358) The words here are nearly the same as before; the\ncommentators give no explanation of the repetition. But see [p.\n281](sbe0837.htm#page_281), note  2.\n\n[282:4](sbe0838.htm#fr_1359) Cf. Gita, [p. 79](sbe0810.htm#page_79). The full\nsense is that from the study of this Om the highest good is attained.\n\n[282:5](sbe0838.htm#fr_1360) I. e. to their own dwellings, believing that they\nhad learnt what they wanted.\n\n[283:1](sbe0838.htm#fr_1361) The meaning seems to be that the original\ninclination was not altered by the new instruction received by them. Nilaka\n_nth_ a seems to understand the passage differently. What has been rendered in\nthe text by 'when they were running for instruction,' he renders by 'when they\nwere practically carrying out the instruction received by them;' but this\nrendering seems to omit all consideration of the words 'Purvameva tu'--\nalready. Though, therefore, there are one or two circumstances in favour of\nthis construction, I have adopted the other. Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p.\n964.\n\n[283:2](sbe0838.htm#fr_1362) The meaning is that the real instructor is within\noneself, 'abiding in the heart,' as said before, although instruction may in\nform be received from one outside, of whom one seeks to learn, and whom one\nrespects (or extols highly, as the text has it), and although such instruction\nmay be well apprehended.\n\n[283:3](sbe0838.htm#fr_1363) Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, pp. 546-853.\n\n[283:4](sbe0838.htm#fr_1364) See Gita, [p. 117](sbe0818.htm#page_117).\n\n[283:5](sbe0838.htm#fr_1365) I. e. fasts and other like observances.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XII](sbe0839.htm)\n\n"
