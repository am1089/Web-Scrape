Kingsbury and G.P. Phillips,\n[1921], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 1\n\n### INTRODUCTION\n\n### (A)--The Hymns and their Significance\n\nTHE voice of chanting and song, to the accompaniment of unfamiliar\ninstruments, floats out over the high wall of the temple in the coolness of\nthe evening or the dawn, making the Western passer-by wonder what it is that\nis being chanted and sung. If only he had a Hindu hymn-book he thinks he could\nlearn from it the spirit of Hinduism as well as a non-Christian could learn\nChristianity from Christian hymns. For the Tamil country at any rate there\n_is_ such a hymnbook, and our present aim is to give enough specimens from it\nfor readers to know what the hymns are like. Englishmen are wanting to\nunderstand India more than they ever wanted before, for their debt to India is\nheavy. Indians are wanting more than ever before to know the wonderful past of\ntheir own country, and the wonder of it is all bound up with its religion. At\nsuch a time these hymns are worth looking into, for they are being sung in\ntemples and homes throughout the Tamil country, and Tamil is the mother-tongue\nof more than eighteen millions of people. For pious S\xcc\x81aivites they equal in\nauthority the Sanskrit Vedas; the mere learning of them by rote is held to be\na virtue, and devout. Tamil parents compel their children to memorize them in\nmuch the same way as Christian parents make their children learn the Psalms.\n\np. 2\n\nThe hymns here given are specimens from the D\xc4\x93v\xc4\x81ram and the Tiruv\xc4\x81chakam. The\nD\xc4\x93v\xc4\x81ram is the first of the collections of works held as canonical by Tamil\nS\xcc\x81aivites. Its hymns were composed between six and eight hundred A.D. by the\nthree authors of whom this book gives some account, and the whole was put\ntogether in one collection of 797 stanzas by Nambi \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81r Nambi about 1000 A.D.\nThe Tiruv\xc4\x81chakam, or Sacred Utterance, was written by one author, M\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87ikya\nV\xc4\x81chaka (Tamilized as M\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87ikka V\xc4\x81sahar) at a date so far unsettled that\nscholars are still divided on the question whether it preceded or followed the\nD\xc4\x93v\xc4\x81ram, though most scholars place it in the ninth, or early in the tenth,\ncentury. Whenever it was written, it stands even higher than the D\xc4\x93v\xc4\x81ram in\nthe affections of Tamil people.\n\nOut of an immense number of hymns we have tried to select those which are most\nrepresentative, those which are favourites, and those which contain the most\nstriking thoughts. But it is amazingly difficult to give a fair or adequate\nidea of them in an English rendering. They are essentially songs, intended to\nbe sung to Indian tunes, in metres which no English metre can represent. Much\nof their charm depends upon assonance, upon plays upon words, upon close\nknitting of word with word, upon intricacy of metre and rhyme, almost as much\nas upon the substance. We can only claim a fair degree of accuracy in our\nrenderings, apologizing to the lovers of Tamil poetry for the plainness and\npoverty of our representation of so rich and varied an original. All our\ntranslations are new, and nearly all of those from the D\xc4\x93v\xc4\x81ram represent\nverses which have never before been done\n\np. 3\n\ninto English. One of the translators of this book learned as S\xcc\x81aivite child to\nlove these hymns, and therefore is the authority in matters of interpretation,\nthe Englishman being responsible for the form. We shall be quite satisfied if\nour translations serve to call attention to the poems, and are some day\nreplaced by worthier renderings.\n\nWe have tried to reduce introductory matter to a minimum, only giving such\ninformation as is necessary to enable readers to understand the hymns and the\nallusions in them. But it is entirely necessary to say something about the\nworship of S\xcc\x81iva, and to give a few words of biography of each of the four\nauthors from whose work this book contains extracts.\n\n##### (B)--The Worship of S\xcc\x81iva\n\n1\\. _Its history previous to these poems_.\n\nThe word S\xcc\x81iva occurs even in the Rig Veda, but there it is only in\nconjunction with Rudra. The joining together of these names provokes\nconjectures as to whether we have here an amalgamation of two earlier deities,\nan Aryan and a Dravidian, but these need not detain us here, since clearly\neven at this early date S\xcc\x81iva was an Aryan deity, identical with Rudra the\nstorm-god, and father of the Maruts, storm-gods themselves. Rudra is a\nhandsome god; he uses his thunderbolts chiefly for punishing evil-doers, and\nis on the whole a kindly being. The name S\xcc\x81iva means auspicious,\' and must not\nbe confused with the Tamil word for \'red,\' although as it happens Rudra-S\xcc\x81iva\nwas a red being,\n\np. 4\n\nIn the period of the Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, we find that S\xcc\x81iva, instead of being one of a\nmultitude of nature-deities, has risen to be one of the great triad, Brahm\xc4\x81,\nVish\xe1\xb9\x87u, and S\xcc\x81iva, who are far above all gods. How the change has come about\nwe have not yet the means of discovering. The function has changed as much as\nthe person, S\xcc\x81iva being now the destroyer as Brahm\xc4\x81 is the creator and Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u\nthe preserver. The process of reduction in the number of the superior deities\ngoes further, and Brahm\xc4\x81 falls practically into the background, leaving only\nVish\xe1\xb9\x87u and S\xcc\x81iva as supreme beings for the worship of the people of India. By\nthe time Hinduism penetrated southwards into the Tamil country, probably\nsomewhere about 500 B.C., it had two main forms, the worship of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u and the\nworship of S\xcc\x81iva, the two being not too sharply disconnected. The Tamil Hindu\nbelieved in the existence of both, but held his own god, whether S\xcc\x81iva or\nVish\xe1\xb9\x87u, to be supreme. Hinduism seemed to be Firmly established, but was\ndangerously shaken when the Jains and Buddhists spread over South India. Then\ncame for the Vaish\xe1\xb9\x87avites the teachers known as the \xc4\x80l\xcc\xa4v\xc4\x81rs, while S\xcc\x81aivism\nwas defended by the poets of whose work this book gives specimens. Hinduism\nwas saved, but it existed henceforth in two distinct forms, Vaish\xe1\xb9\x87avism and\nS\xcc\x81aivism, separated by a wider gulf than in earlier days.\n\n2\\. _The portrait of S \xcc\x81iva and its interpretation_.\n\nS\xcc\x81iva as imagined by his worshippers has a human form, usually with one but\noccasionally with five or six heads. He has three eyes, the right one being\nreally the sun, the left eye the moon, and the one in the middle of his\nforehead fire, His reddish hair is\n\np. 5\n\nmatted in the ascetic way, and on it is the crescent moon, the Ganges, and one\nor more cobras, while wreathed about it is a garland of kon\xe1\xb8\x8dai (Cassia)\nflowers. He has four arms, though occasional representations show eight, but\none body and two legs. Commonly he is seated on a grey-coloured bull. In\ncolour he is reddish, but his body is smeared over with white sacred ash. He\nholds in his hands various things such as a battle-axe, a deer, fire, a\ntrident, a bow. Round his neck, which is dark, hangs a long necklace, the\nbeads of which are skulls. At his waist he wears sometimes an elephant\'s hide,\nsometimes a tiger-skin, sometimes only a very scanty loin-cloth. Generally his\nconsort, Um\xc4\x81, is at his left side, but sometimes he is pictured as half man\nand half woman, the right half (S\xcc\x81iva) being pink-coloured, and the left half\n(Um\xc4\x81) green or black. S\xcc\x81iva\'s abode is said to be on Mount Kail\xc4\x81sa in the\nHim\xc4\x81layas, but among his special haunts is the burning-ground, where bodies\nare cremated. One of the favourite manifestations of S\xcc\x81iva is that as\nNa\xe1\xb9\xadar\xc4\x81ja, the dancer in the great hall at Chidambaram, of which we give a\npicture (see [frontispiece](htss00.htm#img_front)). Here S\xcc\x81iva has one face,\nfour arms, and two legs, performing a spirited dance. His right foot rests on\na demon named Muyalahan. He is sometimes represented as dancing along with\nK\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\xb7\xc4\xab, not the K\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\xb7\xc4\xab who in North India is identified with Um\xc4\x81, but a she-devil\nfeared in the South.\n\nDoubtless each of these features in the manifestation of S\xcc\x81iva has its\nhistory, but that is unknown at present. The legends give fanciful\nexplanations of most of them. The tiger\'s skin and the elephant\'s hide, for\ninstance, are those which S\xcc\x81iva stripped from the wild animals sent against\nhim by the magic of his\n\np. 6\n\nenemies the \xe1\xb9\x9bishis of Daruk\xc4\x81vana. But it is of more interest to find the\nreligious ideas which these things suggest to a thoughtful S\xcc\x81aivite devotee\nto-day. The hides remind him that S\xcc\x81iva has all power, and all opposition to\nhim is vain. That right foot of Na\xe1\xb9\xadar\xc4\x81ja set on Muyalahan means that God\ncrushes down all evil. Those skulls in his necklace are the skulls of\nsuccessive Brahm\xc4\x81s, each of whom died after a life lasting many ages. This is\na way of saying that while other gods at last come to their end, S\xcc\x81iva is\neternal and unchanging. S\xcc\x81iva\'s dance suggests how easily, and how\nrhythmically, he performs his five functions of making, preserving,\ndestroying, judging and purifying. And his dance in the burning-ground may\nsometimes carry the message that God becomes most real to men in the solemn\nhour when they part from their dead.\n\n3\\. _Four common legends and their meaning_.\n\nOf the many legends concerning S\xcc\x81iva four are so frequently alluded to in our\npoems that they should be told here, to avoid repeated explanatory notes.\n\n1\\. Brahm\xc4\x81 and Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u once saw a pillar of fire that seemed to grow from the\ndepths of the earth and to pierce beyond the highest heavens. They longed to\nlearn its depth and height, and agreed that Brahm\xc4\x81 should become a swan to fly\nto the pillar\'s top, and Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u a boar to dig to its root. The swan flew up to\nthe sky, but never reached the pillar\'s summit. The boar dug through the earth\nwith his tusk, but never found where the pillar began. Brahm\xc4\x81 and Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u\nperforce acknowledged their limitations and prayed to the pillar, whereupon\nS\xcc\x81iva revealed himself, for the pillar was a form he had assumed. Not even the\ngreatest and\n\np. 7\n\nwisest of creatures can by their searching find out God. But to the humble-\nhearted He reveals Himself.\n\n2\\. R\xc4\x81va\xe1\xb9\x87a, the ten-headed giant king of Ceylon, while on his conquering\nprogress through many realms, came to the North of India and saw Kail\xc4\x81sa the\nsilver mountain. Coveting its beauty he determined to uproot and transplant it\nto his own island. With his ten heads and twenty arms he tried to lift it from\nthe earth, and Kail\xc4\x81sa shook. All the hosts of heaven, and even Irma., were\nterrified by what seemed to them an awful earthquake. But S\xcc\x81iva simply set his\nbig toe upon the mountain, and lo, R\xc4\x81va\xe1\xb9\x87a found himself being crushed to\ndeath. Repenting of his folly, R\xc4\x81va\xe1\xb9\x87a prayed for mercy, and S\xcc\x81iva not only\nforgave him but even gave him fresh boons. For God pardons sinners who repent,\nand gives them blessings which before they did not know.\n\n3\\. Three Asuras, or supernatural beings, once by doing penance obtained from\nS\xcc\x81iva three castles, one of gold, one of silver, and one of iron. These\ncastles could fly at the owners\' desire, and settle down on towns and\nvillages, destroying many lives. In course of time the Asuras became very\nproud and ignored S\xcc\x81iva. Determining to punish them, S\xcc\x81iva mounted a chariot\nwhose wheels were the sun and moon and whose scat was the earth. Brahm\xc4\x81 was\nhis charioteer, the four Vedas the horses, Mount Meru his bow, the ancient\nserpent \xc4\x80dis\xcc\x81esha his bow-string, and Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u his arrow. At sight of these\npreparations the gods became conceited, thinking that S\xcc\x81iva could not destroy\nhis enemies without them. S\xcc\x81iva knowing their thoughts simply laughed, and at\nthat laugh the three castles were on the instant reduced to ashes.\n\np. 8\n\nThose who forget God in their pride must be punished. When those whom God uses\nas his instruments begin to think themselves indispensable to him, he shews\nthat his purposes can be fulfilled without them.\n\n4\\. The gods once began to churn the ocean in the hope of obtaining divine\nnectar. The mountain Mand\xc4\x81ra was their churning-stick, the primeval tortoise\nthe pivot on which the stick rested and turned, and the serpent V\xc4\x81suki was the\nchurning-rope. As they churned, at first, great and splendid things came up.\nBut suddenly something black rose up and darkened the whole universe. It was a\nmass of poison, deadly alike to gods and men. In terror of destruction, the\ngods and demons called on S\xcc\x81iva. He came, drank the poison, and saved them\nall. That which was enough to destroy the universe could only stain his throat\nwith a bluish colour. That is why S\xcc\x81iva is often called the "poison-necked" or\n"blue-throated" god. There is a link here, small but real, with the Christian\nteaching of God as ready to suffer for the sake of humbler beings.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sambandar And His Hymns](htss03.htm)\n\n'
