Purusha Naraya _n_ a desired, 'Would that I overpassed all beings!\nwould that I alone were everything here (this universe)!' He beheld this five-\ndays' sacrificial performance, the Purushamedha, and took it 1, and performed\noffering therewith; and having performed offering therewith, he overpassed all\nbeings, and became everything here. And, verily, he who, knowing this,\nperforms the Purushamedha, or who even knows this, overpasses all beings, and\nbecomes everything here.\n\n13:6:1:22\\. For this (offering) there are twenty-three Dikshas, twelve\nUpasads, and five Sutyas (Soma-days). This, then, being a forty-days'\n(performance), including the Dikshas and Upasads, amounts to a Vira _g_  2,\nfor the Vira _g_ consists of forty syllables: [Va _g_. S. XXXI, 5.] 'Thence 3\nVira _g_ (f.) was born, and from out of Vira _g_ the Purusha.'\n\np. 404\n\n[paragraph continues] This, then, is that Vira _g_ , and from out of that Vira\n_g_ he (the Sacrificer) generates the Purusha, the Sacrifice.\n\n13:6:1:33\\. Now these (forty days) are four decades; and as to there being\nthese four decades, it is for the obtainment of these worlds, as well as of\nthe regions: by the first decade they 1 obtained even this (terrestrial)\nworld, by the second the air, by the third the sky, and by the fourth the\nregions (quarters); and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by the first\ndecade, obtain even this (terrestrial) world, by the second the air, by the\nthird the sky, and by the fourth the regions--and, indeed, as much as these\nworlds and the regions are, so much is all this (universe); and the\nPurushamedha is everything: thus it is for the sake of his obtaining and\nsecuring everything.\n\n13:6:1:44\\. On the Upavasatha 2 (day) there are eleven victims sacred to Agni\nand Soma: the performance for these is one and the same. There are eleven\nstakes,--the Trish _t_ ubh (verse) consists of eleven syllables, and the Trish\n_t_ ubh is a thunderbolt, and the Trish _t_ ubh is vigour: with the\nthunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus from the first repels evil.\n\n13:6:1:55\\. On the Sutya (days) there are the (Savaniya) victims of the set of\neleven 3 (stakes),--the Trish _t_ ubh consists of eleven syllables, and the\nTrish _t_ ubh is a thunderbolt, and the Trish _t_ ubh is vigour: with the\nthunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus from the first repels evil.\n\np. 405\n\n13:6:1:66\\. And, again, as to why there are (the victims) of the set of eleven\n(stakes): it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing everything, for the\nset of eleven (stakes) is everything, since the set of eleven (stakes) is Pra\n_g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is everything, and the Purushamedha is\neverything.\n\n13:6:1:77\\. Now this Purushamedha is a five-days' sacrificial performance--the\nsacrifice is fivefold, the victim is fivefold, and five seasons are a year:\nwhatsoever of five kinds there is, either concerning the deity or the self\n(body), all that he thereby obtains.\n\n13:6:1:88\\. The first day thereof is an Agnish _t_ oma; then (follows) an\nUkthya, then an Atiratra, then an Ukthya, then an Agnish _t_ oma: this\n(sacrifice) thus has light ( _g_ yotis 1) on both sides, and an Ukthya on both\nsides (of the central Atiratra).\n\n13:6:1:99\\. It is a five-days' (sacrifice), like a barley-corn in the middle\n2; for the Purushamedha is these worlds, and these worlds have light on both\nsides--through Agni (the sacrificial fire) on this side, and through \xc3\x82ditya\n(the Sun) on the other: therefore it has light on both sides. And the Ukthya\nis food, and the Atiratra the body (self); and because there are these Ukthyas\non both sides of the Atiratra, therefore this body is surrounded by food. And\nthat Atiratra which is the largest of them is in. the middle, it is thereby\nthat it (the body, or sacrifice) is like a barley-corn (yava) in the middle;\nand, verily,\n\np. 406\n\nwhosoever knows this repels (yu) his hateful enemy: 'He alone exists, not his\nhateful enemy,' thus they say of him.\n\n13:6:1:1010\\. The first day is for it this same (terrestrial) world, and the\nspring season 1 also is this its (terrestrial) world; and the second day is\nwhat there is above this (terrestrial) world and below the air, and the summer\nseason also is that (part) of it; and the central day is its air, and the\nrainy and autumn seasons also are its air; and the fourth day is what is above\nthe air, and below the sky, and the winter season also is that (part) of it;\nand its fifth day is the sky, and the dewy season also is its sky: thus as to\nthe deities.\n\n13:6:1:1111\\. Then as to the body 2. The first day is its feet, and the spring\nseason also is its feet; and the second day is what is above the feet, and\nbelow the waist, and the summer season also is that (part) of it; and the\ncentral day is its waist, and the rainy and autumn seasons also are its waist;\nthe fourth day is what is above the waist and below the head, and the winter\nseason also is that (part) of it; and the fifth day is its head, and the dewy\nseason also is its head:--thus these worlds, as well as the year and the\n(sacrificer's) self, pass into the Purushamedha for the obtainment and\nsecuring of everything, for, indeed, these worlds are everything, and the year\nis everything, and the self is everything, and the Purushamedha is everything.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[403:1](sbe44110.htm#fr_1055) That is, according to Harisvamin, he brought its\npowers into play, and accomplished all his desires:--tatsadhanany upapadayat,\ntenaya _m_ ya _g_ anena samihita _m_ sakala _m_ sadhitavan ity artha _h_.\n\n[403:2](sbe44110.htm#fr_1056) The Vira _g_ -verse consists of decasyllabic\npadas, the most common form of the verse being one of three padas (or thirty\nsyllables), whilst here the one consisting of four padas is alluded to, and\nVira _g_ -verses of one and two padas likewise occur. There is also a parallel\nform of the Vira _g_ -metre consisting of (usually three) hendeca-syllabic\npadas.\n\n[403:3](sbe44110.htm#fr_1057) That is, from the Purusha; cf. Rig-v. S. X, 90,\n5.\n\n[404:1](sbe44110.htm#fr_1058) Harisvamin supplies 'purve purusha _h_ ' (?\nformer men, or the first seven purusha _h_ , the seven _Ri_ shis).\n\n[404:2](sbe44110.htm#fr_1059) That is, the day before the Soma-sacrifice.\n\n[404:3](sbe44110.htm#fr_1060) See III, 7, 2, 1 seqq.\n\n[405:1](sbe44110.htm#fr_1061) Viz. an Agnish _t_ oma form of the Gyotish _t_\noma order of sacrifice. Cf. part iv, p. 287, note 2.\n\n[405:2](sbe44110.htm#fr_1062) That is, becoming larger towards the middle,\ninasmuch as the Ukthya is--as far as Stotras and Sastras, and cups of Soma are\nconcerned--a larger sacrifice than the Agnish _t_ oma; and the Atiratra is the\nlargest form of all.\n\n[406:1](sbe44110.htm#fr_1063) It should be borne in mind here that the\nsacrifice (Pra _g_ apati) is identical with the Sacrificer on the one hand,\nand with the year on the other.\n\n[406:2](sbe44110.htm#fr_1064) Or, as to the self, viz. of Pra _g_ apati (and\nthe Sacrificer), which the sacrifice is supposed to reproduce.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 6, 2.
