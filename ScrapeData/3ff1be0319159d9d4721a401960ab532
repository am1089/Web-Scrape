On account of remembrance; so Badari opines.\n\nOr else the highest Lord may be called 'measured by a span' because he is\nremembered by means of the mind which is seated in the heart which is measured\nby a span. Similarly, barley-corns which are measured by means of prasthas are\nthemselves called prasthas. It must be admitted that barley-grains themselves\nhave a certain size which is merely rendered manifest through their being\nconnected with a prastha measure; while the highest Lord himself does not\npossess a size to be rendered manifest by his connexion with the heart. Still\nthe remembrance (of the Lord by means of the mind) may be accepted as offering\na certain foundation for the _S_ ruti passage concerning him who is measured\nby a span.--Or else 1 the Sutra may be interpreted to mean that the Lord,\nalthough not really measured by a span, is to be remembered (meditated upon)\nas being of the measure of a span; whereby the passage is furnished with an\nappropriate sense.--Thus the passage about him who is measured by a span may,\naccording to the opinion of the teacher Badari, be referred to the highest\nLord, on account of remembrance.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[151:1](sbe34067.htm#fr_165) Parima _n_ asya h _ri_ da _y_ advararopitasya\nsmaryama _n_ e katham aropo vishayavishayitvena bhedad ity a _s_ a _n_ kya\nvyakhyantaram aha prade _s_ eti. \xc3\x82nanda Giri.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 31](sbe34068.htm)\n\n"
