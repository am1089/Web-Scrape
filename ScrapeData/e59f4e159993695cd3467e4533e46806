[1897], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n8:5:4\n\np. 95\n\n### FOURTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n8:5:4:11\\. He lays them down on the range of the Asha _dh_ a; for the Asha\n_dh_ a is speech, and this (set of bricks 1) is the essence (of food): he thus\nlays into speech the essence of food; whence it is through (the channel of)\nspeech that one distinguishes the essence of food for all the limbs.\n\n8:5:4:22\\. And, again, as to why (on the range) of the Asha _dh_ a;--the Asha\n_dh_ a, doubtless, is this (earth), and the Stomabhagas are yonder sun: he\nthus establishes yonder sun upon this earth as a firm foundation.\n\n8:5:4:33\\. And, again, why (on that) of the Asha _dh_ a;--the Asha _dh_ a,\ndoubtless, is this (earth), and the Stomabhagas are the heart: he thus lays\ninto this (earth) the heart, the mind: whence on this (earth) one thinks with\nthe heart, with the mind. He lays them down on every side: he thus places the\nheart, the mind everywhere; whence everywhere on this (earth) one thinks with\nthe heart, with the mind. And, moreover, these (bricks) are lucky signs: he\nplaces them on all sides; whence they say of him who has a (lucky) sign\n(lakshman) on every (or any) side that he has good luck (pu _n_ yalakshmika).\n\n8:5:4:44\\. He then covers them with loose soil; for loose soil (purisha) means\nfood, and this (set of bricks) is the essence (of food): he thus makes it\ninvisible, for invisible, as it were, is the essence of food.\n\n8:5:4:55\\. And, again, as to why (he covers it) with loose\n\np. 96\n\nsoil;--loose soil, doubtless, means food, and this (set of bricks) is the\nessence: he thus joins and unites the food and its essence.\n\n8:5:4:66\\. And, again, as to why with loose soil;--the Stomabhagas are the\nheart, and the loose soil is the pericardium: he thus encloses the heart in\nthe pericardium.\n\n8:5:4:77\\. And, again, as to why with loose soil;--this fire-altar is the\nyear, and by means of the soil-coverings of the layers he divides it: those\nfirst four layers are four seasons. And having laid down the Stomabhagas, he\nthrows loose soil thereon: that is the fifth layer, that is the fifth season.\n\n8:5:4:88\\. Here now they say, 'Since the other layers conclude with Lokamp\n_ri_ _n_ as (space-filling bricks), and no space-filler is laid down in this\n(layer): what, then, is the space-filler therein?' The space-filler, surely,\nis yonder sun, and this layer is he; and this is of itself 1 a space-filling\nlayer. And what there is above this (layer) up to the covering of soil that is\nthe sixth layer, that is the sixth season.\n\n8:5:4:99\\. He then throws down the loose soil. Thereon he lays down the Vikar\n_n_ i and the naturally-perforated (brick); he bestrews them with chips of\ngold, and places the fire thereon: that is the seventh layer, that is the\nseventh season.\n\n8:5:4:1010\\. But, indeed, there are only six of them; for as to the Vikar _n_\ni and the Svayam-at _ri_ _n_ _n_ a, they belong to the sixth layer.\n\n8:5:4:1111\\. And, indeed, there are only five of them,--on the other (layers)\nhe throws down the loose soil with a prayer, and here (he does so) silently:\nin that\n\np. 97\n\nrespect this is not a layer. And the other layers end with space-fillers, but\nhere he lays down no space-filler: in that respect also this is not a layer.\n\n8:5:4:1212\\. And, indeed, there are only three of them,--the first layer is\nthis very (terrestrial) world; and the uppermost (layer) is the sky; and those\nthree (intermediate layers) are the air, for there is, as it were, only one\nair here: thus (there are) three, or five, or six, or seven of them.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[95:1](sbe4322.htm#fr_179) Or, this fire-altar.\n\n[96:1](sbe4322.htm#fr_180) Or, and he (the sun) himself.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII. 6, 1.
