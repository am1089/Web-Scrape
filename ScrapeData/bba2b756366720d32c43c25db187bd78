Arjuna\nhad one wife more; she was Subhadra, the sister of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. By the\norder of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, Arjuna stole her away (took her by force). The great\nhero Abhimanyu was born of Subhadra. This Abhimanyu and the five sons of\nDraupadi were killed in battle. Abhimanyu's wife Uttara was the charming\ndaughter of the king Vira _t_. She gave birth to one dead child, after all the\nboys, the descendants of the family were extinct. The above child died out of\nthe arrows of As'vatthama. The extraordinarily powerful S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a\nHimself made alive again this his sister's dead grandson. As this son was born\nafter the family had become extinct, he became known in the world by the name\nof Pariksit. When the sons were all destroyed, Dhritarastra became very sorry,\nand, tormented by the arrow-like words of Bhima, remained in the kingdom of\nthe Pa _nd_ avas. Gandhari, too, exceedingly distressed on the bereavement of\nthe sons, remained there also. Yudhisthira, day and night, served Dhritarastra\nand Gandhari. The greatly religious Vidura always used to console, by the\nadvice of Yudhisthira, his brother Dhritarastra, who possessed the eye of\nwisdom and he remained by his brother's side. Dharma`s son Yudhisthira used to\nserve his uncle Dhritarastra in such a way as he might forget the pain of the\ndeath of his sons. But Bhima used to pierce his heart by\n\n\n\np. 99\n\n\n\nhis arrow-like words that he pronounced so loud as to reach the ears of the\nold king Dhritarastra. Bhima used to-say :-- \xc2\x93In the battle field I killed all\nthe sons, of the wicked blind king (Dhritarastra) and it was I that sucked\nwell and drunk, full to the brim, the blood of the heart of Duhs'asana. Now\nthis blind king eats shamelessly like a crow and a dog, the mass of food (Pi\n_nd_ a) given by me, and thus is bearing uselessly the burden of life. Daily\nBhima used to tell, thus, harsh words to him; whereas the religious\nYudhisthira used to console him, saying \xc2\x93Bhima is a quite illiterate brute\xc2\x94\nand so forth. The king Dhritarastra remained there with a grieved heart for\neighteen years; the one day he proposed to the Dharma's son Yudhisthira about\nhis intention to dwell in forest thus :-- \xc2\x93To-day I wish to perform Tarpa _n_\nas in the names my sons. True it is, that Bhima performed the funeral\nobsequies of them all; but, having in view of the former enmity, he did not do\nanything for my sons. If you give me some money, I will, then, perform the\nfuneral obsequies of my sons and then retire to the forest to perform tapasya\nthat I can go to Heaven.\xc2\x94 Vidura also asked Yudhisthira privately pay to\nDhritarashtra the sum that he wanted; Yudhisthira also intended to pay the\nrequired money. Then Yudhisthira, the lord of the world call his younger\nbrothers and addressed them as follows :-- \xc2\x93O highly fortunate ones! Our\nrevered uncle is desirous to perform the funeral obsequies of his sons; so we\nwill have to give him some money for the purpose.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of his\nelder brother of indomitable valour, Pavana's son, the mighty armed Bhima\nbecame very angry and spoke out follows :-- \xc2\x93O highly lucky one! Is it that we\nwill have to give wealth for the spiritual benefit of Duryodhana and others?\nWhat a great stupidity can there be than the fact that such a malevolent blind\nking is deriving so great happiness at your hands? O \xc3\x82rya! It is by your bad\ncounsel that we suffered endless troubles in the forest and the extremely good\nDraupadi was brought before the public in the hall by Duhs'asana. O one of\ngood vows! It is for your satisfaction alone that we, though we were very\nmighty, had to remain in the house of Matsya Raj Virat as servants. Had you\nnot been our elder brother and not been addicted to the gambling, would it\nhave been possible I, who killed Jarasandha, would have been a cook to Virat\nRaj! Never we had been put to so great a trouble! Never would the mighty armed\nArjuna, the Vasava's son, have acted the part of an actress (a dancer),\ndressing himself in a female garb, under the name Vrihannala. Alas! What more\npainful could there be by assuming a human birth that the hands of Arjuna,\nthat wielded always the Gandiva bow, would have worn bracelets befitting a\nwoman? I would have been happy then\n\n\n\np. 100\n\n\n\nhad I, seeing the braid of hair on Arjuna's head and the collyrium in his\neyes, __ cut off the head of Dhritarastra!\n\n\n\nO Lord of the earth! Without asking you, I set fire on the house, named\nJatugriha (a lac-house, as built by Duryodhana in order to burn up the Pa _nd_\navas) and therefore the vicious Virochana, who wanted to burn us, was himself\nburnt up. Again, O Lord of men! similarly, without asking you, I slew Kichaka;\nthis is now the one thing I regret that I could not have killed in the same\nway the sons of Dhritarastra before the public hall. O king of kings! It was\nsimply your stupidity that you liberated Duryodhana and other sons, the great\nenemies of the Gandarbhas, when they had been imprisoned by them. Again to-day\nyou are willing to give wealth for the spiritual benefit of those Duryodhana\nand others! But, O Lord of the earth, I would never give wealth, even if you\nrequest me specially to do this.\n\n\n\nThus saying, Bhima went away. Dharma's son Yudhisthira then consulted with the\nother three brothers and gave abundance of wealth to Dhritarastra. With this\nsum, the Ambika's son Dhritarastra duly performed the Sradh ceremony of his\nsons and gave away lots of things to the Brahma _n_ as. The king Dhritarastra,\nthus performing all the funeral obsequies, became ready to go early to the\nforest with Gandhari, Kunti and Vidura. By the help of Sanjaya, the highly\nintelligent Dhritarastra became informed of the roads of the forest, and then\nwent out of the house. Surasena's daughter Kunti, though stopped by her sons,\nfollowed them. Bhima and other Kauravas went along with them weeping up to the\nbanks of the Ganges and thence returned to Hastinapura.\n\n\n\nThe ascetics went to the auspicious S\xc2\x92atayupa hermitage on the banks of the\nGanges and building a hut practised tapasya with their hearts concentrated.\nThus six years elapsed when Yudhisthira, troubled by their bereavements, said\nto his younger brothers :-- \xc2\x93 I dreamt that our mother Kunti got very __ lean\nand thin. Now my mind wants bitterly to see mother, uncle, aunt, the high\nsouled Vidura and the highly intelligent Sanjaya. If you approve, I want to go\nto there.\xc2\x94 Then the five brothers, Pan _d_ u's sons, became desirous to see\nKunti, and taking with them Draupadi, Subhadra, Uttara, and other persons went\nto the Satayupa hermitage and saw the persons there; but not seeing Vidura,\nYudhisthira asked :-- \xc2\x93Where is Vidura?\xc2\x94 Hearing this Dhritarastra said :--\n\xc2\x93Vidura has taken up Vairagyam (dispassion) and has gone alone to a solitary\nplace and is meditating in his heart the eternal Brahma.\xc2\x94 Next day while the\nking Yudhisthira was walking along the banks of the Ganges, he saw in the\nforest Vidura, engaged in his vow and become lean and thin by his tapasya; he\nthen exclaimed :-- \xc2\x93I am the king Yudhisthira;\n\n\n\np. 101\n\n\n\nI am saluting you.\xc2\x94 The holy Vidura heard and remained motionless like a log\nof wood. Within an instant a wonderful halo came out of Vidura's face and\nentered the mouth of Yudhisthira, both of them being Dharma's parts. Vidura\nthen died; Yudhisthira expressed great sorrow. When the Vidura's body was\ngoing to be set on fire, a celestial voice was heard :--\xc2\x93O king! He was very\nwise; so he ought not to be burnt; you can go away as you like.\xc2\x94 Hearing this,\nYudhisthira bathed in the pure Ganges and returned to the As'rama and informed\neverything in detail to Dhritarastra. While the Pa _nd_ avas were staying in\nthe hermitage with the other inhabitants of the city, Vedavyasa, Narada, and\nother high-souled Munis came there to Yudhisthira. Kunti then spoke to the\nauspicious Vyasa :-- \xc2\x93O Krisna! I saw my son Karna, only just when he was\nborn; my mind is being very much tormented for him; so, O great ascetic! Show\nhim once to me. O highly fortunate One! You alone can do this; so O Lord!\nSatisfy my heart\xc2\x92s desire.\xc2\x94 Gandhari said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! I did not see while\nDuryodhan went to battle; so, O Muni! Show me Duryodhana with his younger\nbrothers.\xc2\x94 Subhadra said :-- \xc2\x93O Omniscient one! I want very much to see the\ngreat hero Abhimanyu, dearer to me than my life even; O great ascetic! Show\nhim once to me.\xc2\x94 (33-57.)\n\n\n\nSuta said :-- Satyavati's son Vyasa Deva, hearing their words, held Pranayama\n(deep breathing exercise) and meditated on the eternal Devi, the force of\nBrahma. When the evening time came, the Muni invited Yudhisthira and all\nothers to the banks of the Ganges. He then bathed in the Ganges and began to\nchant hymns in praise of the Devi Brahmamayi Prakriti, resting on the Puru _s_\na, the Dweller in the Mani Dvipa, with attributes, at the same time\ntranscending them, thus :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! When Brahma was not, Vi _sn_ u was not,\nMahes'vara was not, nor when existing lndra, Varuna, Kuvera, Yama, and Agni,\nThou alone existed then; my salutation to Thee.\n\n\n\nWhen there existed not water, Vayu, ether, earth and their Gu _n_ as, taste,\nsmell, etc., when there were no senses, mind, Buddhi, Ahamkara; when there\nexisted no Sun, Moon nor anything, Thou alone existed then; so, O Devi! I bow\ndown again and again to Thee. O Mother! Thou holdest all these visible Jiva\nlokas in the cosmic Hira _n_ yagarbha; again Thou bringest this Hira _n_\nyagarbha, the sum-total of Linga Sariras (the subtle bodies), with the Gu _n_\nas Sattva, Rajas and Tamas to a state of equilibrium named Samyavastha and\nremainest quite independent and apart for a Kalpa period. At that time even\nthose that are possessed of the power of great discrimination and dispassion\ncannot fathom Thy nature. O Mother! These persons are praying to me to see\ntheir dead\n\n\n\np. 102\n\n\n\nones; but I am quite incapable to do that. So kindly shew them their departed\nones early.\xc2\x94 While Vyasa praised thus the Devi, the Devi Mahamaya, the Lady of\nthe Universe, of the nature of Universal Consciousness called all the departed\nones from the Heavens and showed them to their relatives. Then Kunti,\nGandhari, Subhadra, Uttara, and the Pa _nd_ avas became very glad to see their\nrelatives come to them again. Vyasa, of indomitable valour, again remembering\nMahamaya, bade good bye to the departed ones; it seemed then, a great magic\nhad occurred. The Pa _nd_ avas and the Munis bade good bye to each other and\nwent to their respective places. The king Yudhisthira talked on the way about\nVyasa and ultimately came to Hastina. (58-68.)\n\n\n\nThus ends the seventh chapter of the Second Skandha on shewing the departed\nones in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 8](bk02ch08.htm)\n\n"
