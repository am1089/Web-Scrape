Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# MAHABHARATA BOOK III\n\n# RAJASUYA\n\n_\n\n(The Imperial Sacrifice)\n\n_\n\nA CURIOUS incident followed the bridal of Draupadi. The five sons of Pandu\nreturned with her to the potter\'s house, where they were living on alms\naccording to the custom of Brahmans, and the brothers reported to their mother\nthat they had received a great gift on that day. "Enjoy ye the gift in\ncommon," replied their mother, not knowing what it was. And as a mother\'s\nmandate cannot be disregarded, Draupadi became the common wife of the five\nbrothers.\n\nThe real significance of this strange legend is unknown. The custom of\nbrothers marrying a common wife prevails to this day in Thibet and among the\nhill-tribes of the Himalayas, but it never prevailed among the Aryan Hindus of\nIndia. It is distinctly prohibited in their laws and institutes, and finds no\nsanction in their literature, ancient or modern. The legend in the _Maha-\nbharata_ , of brothers marrying a wife in common, stands alone and without a\nparallel in Hindu traditions and literature.\n\nJudging from the main incidents of the Epic, Draupadi might rather be regarded\nas the wife of the eldest brother Yudhishthir. Bhima had already mated himself\nto a female in a forest, by whom he had a son, Ghatotkacha, who distinguished\nhimself in war later on. Arjun too married the sister of Krishna, shortly\nafter Draupadi\'s bridal, and had by her a son, Abhimanyu, who was one of the\nheroes of the war. On the other hand, Yudhishthir took to him self no wife\nsave Draupadi, and she was crowned with Yudhishthir in the Rajasuya or\nImperial Sacrifice. Notwithstanding the legend, therefore, Draupadi might be\nregarded as wedded to Yudhishthir, though won by the skill of Arjun, and this\nassumption would be in keeping with Hindu customs and laws, ancient and\nmodern.\n\nThe jealous Duryodhan heard that his contrivance to kill his cousins at\nVaranavata had failed. He also heard that they had found a powerful friend in\nDrupad, and had formed an alliance with him. It was no longer possible to keep\nthem from their rightful inheritance. The Kuru kingdom was accordingly\nparcelled; Duryodhan retained the eastern and richer portion with its ancient\ncapital _Hastina-pura_ on the Ganges; and the sons of Pandu were given the\nwestern portion on the Jumna, which was then a forest and a wilderness. The\nsons of Pandu cleared the forest and built a new capital _Indra-prastha_ , the\nsupposed ruins of which, near modern Delhi, are still pointed out to the\ncurious traveller.\n\nYudhishthir, the eldest of the five sons of Pandu, and now king of Indra-\nprastha, resolved to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice, which was a formal\nassumption of the Imperial title over all the kings of ancient India. His\nbrothers went out with troops in all directions to proclaim his supremacy over\nall surrounding kings. Jarasandha, the powerful and semi-civilised king of\nMagadha or South Behar, opposed and was killed; but other monarchs recognised\nthe supremacy of Yudhishthir and came to the sacrifice with tributes. King\nDhrita-rashtra and his sons, now reigning at Hastina-pura, were politely\ninvited to take a share in the performance of the sacrifice.\n\nThe portion translated in this Book forms Sections xxxiii. To xxxvi. and\nSection xliv. of Book ii. of the original.\n\n## I\n\n## THE ASSEMBLAGE OF KINGS\n\nAncient halls of proud Hastina mirrored bright on Ganga\'s wave!  \nThither came the son of Pandu, young Nakula true and brave,\n\nCame to ask Hastina\'s monarch, chief of Kuru\'s royal race,  \nTo partake Yudhishthir\'s banquet and his sacrifice to grace.\n\nDhrita-rashtra came in gladness unto Indra-prastha\'s town,  \nMarked its new-built tower and turret on the azure Jumna frown,\n\nWith him came preceptor Kripa, and the ancient Bhishma came,  \nElders of the race of Kuru, chiefs and Brahmans known to fame.\n\nMonarchs came from distant regions to partake the holy rite,  \nWarlike chiefs from court and castle in their arms accoutred bright,\n\nKshatras came with ample tribute for the holy sacrifice,  \nPrecious gems and costly jewels, gold and gifts of untold price.\n\nProud Duryodhan and his brothers came in fair and friendly guise,  \nWith the ancient Kuru monarch and Vidura, good and wise,\n\nWith his son came brave Suvala from Gandhara\'s distant land,  \nCar-borne Salya, peerless Karna, came with bow and spear and brand.\n\nCame the priest and proud preceptor Drona skilled in arms and lore,  \nJayadratha famed for valour came from Sindhu\'s sounding shore,\n\nDrupad came with gallant princes from Panchala\'s land of fame,  \nSalwa lord of outer nations to the mighty gathering came.\n\nBhagadatta came in chariot from the land of nations brave,  \nPrag-jyotisha, where the red sun wakes on Brahma-putra\'s wave,\n\nWith him came untutored _Mlechchas_ who beside the ocean dwell,  \nUncouth chiefs of dusky nations from the lands where mountains swell,\n\nCame Virata, Matsya\'s monarch, and his warlike sons and bold,  \nSisupala, king of Chedi, with his son bedecked in gold.\n\nCame the warlike chiefs of Vrishni from the shores of Western Sea,  \nAnd the lords of Madhya-desa, ever warlike ever free!\n\n## II\n\n## FEAST AND SACRIFICE\n\nJumna\'s dark and limpid waters laved Yudhishthir\'s palace walls  \nAnd to hail him _Dharma-raja_ , monarchs thronged his royal halls,\n\nHe to honoured kings and chieftains with a royal grace assigned  \nPalaces with sparkling waters and with trees umbrageous lined,\n\nHonoured thus, the mighty monarchs lived in mansions milky white,  \nLike the peaks of famed Kailasa lifting proud their snowy height!\n\nGraceful walls that swept the meadows circled round the royal halls,  \nNets of gold belaced the casements, gems bedecked the shining walls,\n\nFlights of steps led up to chambers many-tinted-carpet-graced,  \nAnd festooning fragrant garlands were harmonious interlaced!\n\nFar below from spacious gateways rose the people\'s gathering cry,  \nAnd from far the swan-white mansions caught the ravished gazer\'s eye,\n\nRichly graced with precious metals shone the turrets bright and gay,  \nLike the rich-ored shining turrets of the lofty Himalay.\n\nAnd the scene bedecked by rishis and by priests and kings of might,  \nShone like azure sky in splendour, graced by deathless Sons of Light!\n\nSpake Yudhishthir unto Bhishma, elder of the Kuru race,  \nUnto Drona proud preceptor, rich in lore and warlike grace,\n\nSpake to wise preceptor Kripa, versed in sacred rites of old,  \nTo Duryodhan and his brothers, honoured guests and kinsmen bold:\n\n"Friends and kinsmen, grant your favour and your sweet affection lend,  \nMay your kindness ever helpful poor Yudhishthir\'s rite attend,\n\nAs your own, command my treasure, costly gifts and wealth untold,  \nTo the poor and to the worthy scatter free my gems and gold!"\n\nSpeaking thus he made his _diksha_ , and to holy work inclined,  \nTo his friends and to his kinsmen all their various tasks assigned:\n\nProud Duhsasan in his bounty spread the rich and sumptuous feast,  \nDrona\'s son with due devotion greeted saint and holy priest,\n\nSanjay with a regal honour welcomed king and chief of might,  \nBhishma and the pious Drona watched the sacrificial rite,\n\nKripa guarded wealth and treasure, gold and gems of untold price,  \nAnd with presents unto Brahmans sanctified the sacrifice,\n\nDhrita-rashtra, old and sightless, through the scene of gladness strayed,  \nWith a careful hand Vidura all the mighty cost defrayed,\n\nProud Duryodhan took the tribute which the chiefs and monarchs paid,  \nPious Krishna unto Brahmans honour and obeisance made.\n\n"Twas a gathering fair and wondrous on fair Jumna\'s sacred shore,  \nTributes in a thousand _nishkas_ every willing monarch bore,\n\nCostly gifts proclaimed the homage of each prince of warlike might,  \nChieftains vied with rival chieftains to assist the holy rite.\n\nBright Immortals, robed in sunlight, sailed across the liquid sky,  \nAnd their gleaming cloud-borne chariots rested on the turrets high,\n\nHero-monarchs, holy Brahmans, filled the balls bedecked in gold,  \nWhite-robed priests adept in _mantra_ mingled with the chieftains bold.\n\nAnd amidst this scene of splendour, pious-hearted, pure and good,  \nLike the sinless god VARUNA, gentle-souled Yudhishthir stood,\n\nSix bright fires Yudhishthir lighted, offerings made to gods above,  \nGifts unto the poor and lowly spake the monarch\'s boundless love.\n\nHungry men were fed and feasted with an ample feast of rice,  \nCostly gifts to holy Brahmans graced the noble sacrifice,\n\n_\n\nIda, ajya, homa_ offerings, pleased the "Shining Ones" on high,  \nBrahmans pleased with costly presents with their blessings filled the sky!\n\n## III\n\n## GLIMPSES OF THE TRUTH\n\nDawned the day of _abhisheka_ , proud anointment, sacred bath,  \nCrowned kings and learned Brahmans crowded on Yudhishthir\'s path,\n\nAnd as gods and heavenly _rishis_ throng in BRAHMA\'S mansions bright,  \nHoly priests and noble monarchs graced the inner sacred site!\n\nMeasureless their fame and virtue, great their penance and their power,  \nAnd in converse deep and learned Brahmans passed the radiant hour,\n\nAnd on subjects great and sacred, oft divided in their thought,  \nVarious sages in their wisdom various diverse maxims taught,\n\nWeaker reasons seemed the stronger, faultless reasons often failed,  \nKeen disputants like the falcon fell on views their rivals held!\n\nSome were versed in Laws of Duty, some the Holy Vows professed,  \nSome with gloss and varied comment still his learned rival pressed,\n\nBright the concourse of the Brahmans unto sacred learning given,  \nLike the concourse of the bright stars in the glorious vault of heaven,\n\nNone of impure caste and conduct trespassed on the holy site,  \nNone of impure life and manners stained Yudhishthir\'s sacred rite!\n\n_\n\nDeva-rishi_ , saintly Narad, marked the sacrificial rite,  \nSanctifying by its lustre good Yudhishthir\'s royal might,\n\nAnd a ray of heavenly wisdom lit the _rishi\'s_ inner eye,  \nAs he saw the gathered monarchs in the concourse proud and high!\n\nHe had heard from lips celestial in the heavenly mansions bright,  \nAll these kings were god incarnate, portions of Celestial Light,\n\nAnd he saw in them embodied beings of the upper sky,  \nAnd in lotus-eyed Krishna saw the Highest of the High!\n\nSaw the ancient World\'s Preserver, great Creation\'s Primal Cause,  \nWho had sent the gods as monarchs to uphold his righteous laws,\n\nBattle for the cause of virtue, perish in a deadly war,  \nThen to seek their upper mansions in the radiant realms afar!\n\n"NARAYANA, World\'s Preserver, sent immortal gods on earth,  \nHe himself in race of Yadu hath assumed his mortal birth,\n\nLike the moon among the planets born in Vrishni\'s noble clan,--  \nHe whom bright gods render worship,--NARAYANA, Son of Man,\n\nPrimal Cause and Self-created! when is done his purpose high,  \nNARAYANA leads Immortals to their dwelling in the sky."\n\nSuch bright glimpses of the Secret flashed upon his inner sight,  \nAs in lofty contemplation Narad gazed upon the rite.\n\n## IV\n\n## THE ARGHYA\n\nOutspake Bhishma to Yudhishthir: "Monarch of this wide domain,  \nHonour due to crowned monarchs doth our sacred law ordain,\n\nArghya to the wise Preceptor, to the Kinsman and to Priest,  \nTo the Friend and to the Scholar, to the King as lord of feast,\n\nUnto these is due the _arghya_ , so our holy writs have said,  \nTherefore to these kings assembled be the highest honour paid,\n\nNoble are these crowned monarchs, radiant like the noonday sun,  \nTo the noblest, first in virtue, be the foremost honour done!"\n\n"Who is noblest," quoth Yudhishthir, "in this galaxy of fame,  \nWho of chiefs and crowned monarchs doth our foremost honour claim?"\n\nPond\' ring spake the ancient Bhishma in his accents deep and clear:  \nGreatest midst the great is Krishna! chief of men without a peer\n\nMidst these monarchs pure in lustre, purest-hearted and most high  \nLike the radiant sun is Krishna midst the planets of the sky,\n\nSunless climes are warmed to verdure by the sun\'s returning ray,  \nWindless wastes are waked to gladness when reviving breezes play,\n\nEven so this _rajasuya_ , this thy sacrificial rite,  \nOwes its sanctity and splendour unto Krishna\'s holy might!"\n\nBhishma spake and Sahadeva served his mandate quick as thought,  \nAnd the _arghya_ duly flavoured unto peerless Krishna brought,\n\nKrishna trained in rules of virtue then the offered _arghya_ took,  \nDarkened Sisupala\'s forehead and his frame in tremor shook,\n\nTo Yudhishthir and to Bhishma turns the chief his flaming eyes,  \nTo the great and honoured Krishna, Sisupala wrathful cries.\n\n## V\n\n## SISUPALA\'S PRIDE\n\nNot to Vrishni\'s uncrowned hero should this reverence be paid,  \nMidst these mighty crowned monarchs in their kingly pomp arrayed,\n\nIll beseems the good Yudhishthir, royal Pandu\'s righteous son,  \nHomage to an uncrowned chieftain, to the lowly honour done!\n\nPandu\'s sons are yet untutored, and with knowledge yet unblessed,  \nKnowing Bhishma blessed with wisdom hath the rules of courts transgressed,\n\nLearned in the Laws of Duty he hath sinned from partial love,  \nConscious breach of rules of honour doth our deeper hatred move!\n\nIn this throng of crowned monarchs, ruling kings of righteous fame,  \nCan this uncrowned Vrishni chieftain foremost rank and honour claim?\n\nDoth he as a sage and elder claim the homage to him done?  \nSure his father Vasudeva hath his claims before his son!\n\nDoth he as Yudhishthir\'s kinsman count as foremost and the best?  \nRoyal Drupad by alliance surely might the claim contest!\n\nDoth he as a wise preceptor claim the highest, foremost place,  \nWhen the great preceptor Drona doth his royal mansion grace?\n\nUnto Krishna as a _rishi_ should the foremost rank be given?  \nSaintly Vyasa claims the honour, Vedic bard inspired by Heaven!\n\nUnto Krishna should we render honour for his warlike fame?  \nThou, O Bhishma! Death\'s Subduer, surely might precedence claim!\n\nUnto Krishna for his knowledge should the noble prize we yield?  \nDrona\'s son unmatched in learning surely might contest the field!\n\nGreat Duryodhan midst the princes stands alone without a peer,  \nKripa priest of royal Kurus, holiest of all priests is here!\n\nArcher Karna--braver archer none there is of mortal birth  \nLearnt his arms from Par\'su Rama, he who slew the kings of earth!\n\nWherefore then to unknown Krishna render we this homage free!  \nSaintly priest, nor wise preceptor, king nor foremost chief is he!"\n\n## VI\n\n## SISUPALA\'S FALL\n\nTiger-hearted Sisupala spake in anger stem and high,  \nCalm unto him Krishna answered, but a light was in his eye:\n\n"List, O chiefs and righteous monarchs! from a daughter of our race  \nEvil-destined Sisupala doth his noble lineage trace,\n\nSpite of wrong and frequent outrage, spite of insult often flung,  \nNever in his heart hath Krishna sought to do his kinsman wrong!\n\nOnce I went to eastern regions, Sisupala like a foe  \nBurnt my far-famed seaport Dwarka, laid the mart and temple low,\n\nOnce on Bhoja\'s trusting monarch faithless Sisupala fell,  \nSlew his men and threw him captive in his castle\'s dungeon cell,\n\nOnce for holy _aswamedha_ Vasudeva sent his steed,  \nSisupala stole the charger, sought to stop the righteous deed,\n\nOnce on saintly Babhru\'s consort, pious-hearted, pure and just,  \nSisupala fell in madness, forced the lady to his lust,\n\nOnce Visala\'s beauteous princess went to seek her husband\'s side,  \nIn her husband\'s garb disguised Sisupala clasped the bride,\n\nThis and more hath Krishna suffered, for his mother is our kin,  \nBut the sickening tale appalleth, and he addeth sin to sin!\n\nOne more tale of sin I mention: by his impious passion fired,  \nTo my saintly wife, Rukmini, Sisupala hath aspired,\n\nAs the low-born seeks the _Veda_ , soiling it with impure breath,  \nSisupala sought my consort, and his righteous doom is Death!"\n\nKrishna spake; the rising red blood speaks each angry hero\'s shame,  \nShame for Chedi\'s impious actions, grief for Sisupala\'s fame!\n\nLoudly laughed proud Sisupala, spake with bitter taunt and jeer,  \nAnswered Krishna\'s lofty menace with disdain and cruel sneer:\n\n"Wherefore in this vast assembly thus proclaim thy tale of shame,  \nIf thy wedded wife and consort did inspire my youthful flame?\n\nDoth a man of sense and honour, blest with wisdom and with pride,  \nThus proclaim his wedded consort was another\'s loving bride?\n\nDo thy worst! Or if by anger or by weak forbearance led,  \nSisupala seeks no mercy, nor doth Krishna\'s anger dread!"\n\nLowered Krishna\'s eye and forehead, and unto his hands there came  \nFatal disc, the dread of sinners, disc that never missed its aim,\n\n"Monarchs in this hall assembled!" Krishna in his anger cried,  \n"Oft hath Chedi\'s impious monarch Krishna\'s noble rage defied,\n\nFor unto his pious mother plighted word and troth was given,  \nSisupala\'s hundred follies would by Krishna be forgiven,\n\nI have kept the plighted promise, but his crimes exceed the tale,  \nAnd beneath this vengeful weapon Sisupala now shall quail!"\n\nThen the bright and whirling discus, as this mandate Krishna said,  \nFell on impious Sisupala, from his body smote his head,\n\nFell the mighty-armed monarch like a thunder-riven rock,  \nSevered from the parent mountain by the bolt\'s resistless shook!\n\nAnd his soul be-cleansed of passions came forth from its mortal shroud,  \nLike the radiant sun in splendour from a dark and mantling cloud,\n\nUnto Krishna good and gracious, like a lurid spark aflame,  \nChastened of its sin and anger, Sisupala\'s spirit came!\n\nRain descends in copious torrents, quick the lurid lightnings fly,  \nAnd the wide earth feels a tremor, restless thunders shake the sky,\n\nVarious feelings away the monarchs as they stand in hushed amaze,  \nMutely in those speechless moments on the lifeless warrior gaze!\n\nSome there are who seek their weapons, and their nervous fingers shake,  \nAnd their lips they bite in anger, and their frames in tremor quake,\n\nOthers in their inmost bosom welcome Krishna\'s righteous deed,  \nLook on death of Sisupala as a sinner\'s proper meed,\n\n_\n\nRishis_ bless the deed of Krishna as they wend their various ways,  \nBrahmans pure and pious-hearted chant the righteous Krishna\'s praise!\n\nSad Yudhishthir, gentle-hearted, thus unto his brothers said:  \n"Funeral rites and regal honours be performed unto the dead,"\n\nDuteously his faithful brothers then performed each pious rite,  \nHonours due to Chedi\'s monarch, to his rank and peerless might,\n\nSisupala\'s son they seated in his mighty father\'s place,  \nAnd with holy _abhisheka_ hailed him king of Chedi\'s race!\n\n## VII\n\n## YUDHISHTHIR EMPEROR\n\nThus removed the hapless hindrance, now the holy sacrifice  \nWas performed with joy and splendour and with gifts of gold and rice,\n\nGodlike Krishna watched benignly with his bow and disc and mace,  \nAnd Yudhishthir closed the feasting with his kindliness and grace.\n\nBrahmans sprinkled holy water on the empire\'s righteous lord,  \nAll the monarchs made obeisance, spake in sweet and graceful word:\n\n"Born of race of Ajamidha! thou hast spread thy father\'s fame,  \nRising by thy native virtue thou hast won a mightier name,\n\nAnd this rite unto thy station doth a holier grace instil,  \nAnd thy royal grace and kindness all our hope and wish fulfil,\n\nGrant us, king of mighty monarchs, now unto our realms we go,  \nEmperor o\'er earthly rulers, blessings and thy grace bestow!"\n\nGood Yudhishthir to the monarchs parting grace and honours paid,  \nAnd unto his duteous brothers thus in loving-kindness said:\n\n"To our feast these noble monarchs came from loyal love they bear.  \nFar as confines of their kingdoms, with them let our friends repair."\n\nAnd his brothers and his kinsmen duteously his hest obey,  \nWith each parting guest and monarch journey on the home ward way.\n\nArjun wends with high-souled Drupad, famed for lofty warlike grace,  \nDhrishta-dyumna with Virata, monarch of the Matsya race,\n\nBhima on the ancient Bhishma and on Kuru\'s king doth wait,  \nSahadeva waits on Drona, great in arms, in virtue great,\n\nWith Gandhara\'s warlike monarch brave Nakula holds his way,  \nOther chiefs with other monarchs where their distant kingdoms lay.\n\nLast of all Yudhishthir\'s kinsman, righteous Krishna fain would part,  \nAnd unto the good Yudhishthir opens thus his joyful heart:\n\n"Done this glorious _rajasuya_ , joy and pride of Kuru\'s race,  \nGrant, O friend! to sea-girt Dwarka, Krishna now his steps must trace."\n\n"By thy grace and by thy valour," sad Yudhishthir thus replies,  \n"By thy presence, noble Krishna, I performed this high emprise,\n\nBy thy all-subduing glory monarchs bore Yudhishthir\'s sway,  \nCame with gifts and costly presents, came their tributes rich to pay,\n\nMust thou part? my uttered accents may not bid thee, friend, to go,  \nIn thy absence vain were empire, and this life were full of woe,\n\nYet thou partest, sinless Krishna, dearest, best beloved friend,  \nAnd to Dwarka\'s sea-washed mansions Krishna must his footsteps bend!"\n\nThen unto Yudhishthir\'s mother, pious-hearted Krishna hies,  \nAnd in accents love-inspiring thus to ancient Pritha cries:\n\n"Regal fame and righteous glory crown thy sons, revered dame,  \nJoy thee in their peerless prowess, in their holy spotless fame,\n\nMay thy sons\' success and triumph cheer a widowed mother\'s heart,  \nGrant me leave, O noble lady! for to Dwarka I depart."\n\nFrom Yudhishthir\'s queen Draupadi parts the chief with many a tear,  \nAnd from Arjun\'s wife Subhadra, Krishina\'s sister ever dear,\n\nThen with rites and due ablutions to the gods are offerings made,  \nPriests repeat their benedictions, for the righteous Krishna said,\n\nAnd his faithful chariot-driver brings his falcon-bannered car,  \nLike the clouds in massive splendour and resistless in the war,\n\nPious Krishna mounts the chariot, fondly greets his friends once more,  \nLeaves blue Jumna\'s sacred waters for his Dwarka\'s dear-loved shore,\n\nStill Yudhishthir and his brothers, sad and sore and grieved at heart,  \nFollowed Krishna\'s moving chariot, for they could not see him part,\n\nKrishna stopped once more his chariot, and his parting blessing gave,  \nThus the chief with eyes of lotus spake in accents calm and brave:\n\n_\n\n"King of men! with sleepless watching ever guard thy kingdom flair,  \nLike a father tend thy subjects with a father\'s love and care,\n\nBe unto them like the rain-drop nourishing the thirsty ground,  \nBe unto them tree of shelter shading them from heat around,\n\nLike the blue sky ever bending be unto them ever kind,  \nFree from pride and free from passion rule them with a virtuous mind!"\n\n_\n\nSpake and left the saintly Krishna, pure and pious-hearted chief,  \nSad Yudhishthir wended homeward andhis heart was filled with grief.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book IV: The Fatal Dice](maha04.htm)\n\n'
