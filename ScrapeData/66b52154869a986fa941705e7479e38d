When\nshe wedded him, she said,\n\np. 69\n\n[paragraph continues] \'Thrice a day shalt thou embrace 1 me; but do not lie\nwith me against my will 2, and let me not see thee naked, for such is the way\nto behave to us women.\'\n\n11:5:1:22\\. She then dwelt with him a long time, and was even with child of\nhim, so long did she dwell with him. Then the Gandharvas 3 said to one\nanother, \'For a long time, indeed, has this Urva _s_ i dwelt among men: devise\nye some means how she may come back to us.\' Now, a ewe with two lambs was tied\nto her couch: the Gandharvas then carried off one of the lambs.\n\n11:5:1:33\\. \'Alas,\' [](errata.htm#0)she cried, \'they are taking away my\ndarling 4, as if I were where there is no hero and no man!\' They carried off\nthe second, and she spake in the selfsame manner.\n\n11:5:1:44\\. He then thought within himself, \'How can that be (a place) without\na hero and without a man where I am?\' And naked, as he was, he sprang\n\np. 70\n\nup after them: too long he deemed it that he should put on his garment. Then\nthe Gandharvas produced a flash of lightning, and she beheld him naked even as\nby daylight. Then, indeed, she vanished: \'Here I am back,\' he said, and lo!\nshe had vanished 1. Wailing with sorrow he wandered all over Kurukshetra. Now\nthere is a lotus-lake there, called Anyata _h_ plaksha: He walked along its\nbank; and there nymphs were swimming about in the shape of swans 2.\n\n11:5:1:55\\. And she (Urva _s_ i), recognising him, said, \'This is the man with\nwhom I have dwelt.\' They then said, \'Let us appear to him!\'--\'So be it!\' she\nreplied; and they appeared to him 3.\n\n11:5:1:66\\. He then recognised her and implored her ( _Ri_ g-veda X, 95, I),\n\'Oh, my wife, stay thou, cruel in mind 4: let us now exchange words! Untold,\nthese secrets of ours will not bring us joy in days to\n\np. 71\n\ncome;\'--\'Stop, pray, let us speak together!\' this is what he meant to say to\nher.\n\n11:5:1:77\\. She replied (X, 95, 2), \'What concern have I with speaking to\nthee? I have passed away like the first of the dawns. Pururavas, go home\nagain: I am like the wind, difficult to catch;\'--\'Thou didst not do what I had\ntold thee; hard to catch I am for thee, go to thy home again!\' this is what\nshe meant to say.\n\n11:5:1:88\\. He then said sorrowing (X, 95, 14), \'Then will thy friend 1 rush\naway 2 this day never to come back, to go to the farthest distance: then will\nhe lie in Nir _ri_ ti\'s 3 lap, or the fierce wolves will devour him; Thy\nfriend will either hang himself, or start forth; or the wolves, or dogs, will\ndevour him!\' this is what he meant to say.\n\n11:5:1:99\\. She replied (X, 95, 15), \'Pururavas, do not die! do not rush away!\nlet not the cruel wolves devour thee! Truly, there is no friendship with\nwomen, and theirs are the hearts of hyenas 4;\'--\n\np. 72\n\n[paragraph continues] \'Do not take this to heart! there is no friendship with\nwomen: return home!\' this is what she meant to say.\n\n11:5:1:1010\\. ( _Ri_ g-veda X, 95, 16), \'When changed in form, I walked among\nmortals, and passed the nights there during four autumns 1 ate a little ghee,\nonce a day, and even now I feel satisfied therewith 2.\'--This discourse in\nfifteen verses has been handed down by the Bahv _ri_ _k_ as 3. Then her heart\ntook pity on him 4.\n\n11:5:1:1111\\. She said, \'Come here the last night of the year from now 5: then\nshalt thou lie with me for one night, and then this son of thine will have\nbeen born.\' He came there on the last night of the year, and lo, there stood a\ngolden palace 6! They then\n\np. 73\n\nsaid to him only this (word) 1, \'Enter!\' and then they bade her go to him.\n\n11:5:1:1212\\. She then said, \'To-morrow morning the Gandharvas will grant thee\na boon, and thou must make thy choice.\' He said, \'Choose thou for me!\'--She\nreplied, \'Say, Let me be one of yourselves!\' In the morning the Gandharvas\ngranted him a boon; and he said, \'Let me be one of yourselves!\'\n\n11:5:1:1313\\. They said, \'Surely, there is not among men that holy form of\nfire by sacrificing wherewith one would become one of ourselves.\' They put\nfire into a pan, and gave it to him saying, \'By sacrificing therewith thou\nshalt become one of ourselves.\' He took it (the fire) and his boy, and went on\nhis way home. He then deposited the fire in the forest, and went to the\nvillage with the boy alone. [He came back and thought] \'Here I am back;\' and\nlo! it had disappeared 2: what had been the fire was an A _s_ vattha tree\n(ficus religiosa), and what had been the pan was a _S_ ami tree (mimosa suma).\nHe then returned to the Gandharvas.\n\n11:5:1:1414\\. They said, \'Cook for a whole year a mess of rice sufficient for\nfour persons; and taking each time three logs from this A _s_ vattha tree,\nanoint them with ghee, and put them on the fire with\n\np. 74\n\nverses containing the words "log" and "ghee": the fire which shall result\ntherefrom will be that very fire (which is required).\'\n\n11:5:1:1515\\. They said, \'But that is recondite (esoteric), as it were. Make\nthyself rather an upper ara _n_ i 1 of A _s_ vattha wood, and a lower ara _n_\ni of Sami wood: the fire which shall result therefrom will be that very fire.\'\n\n11:5:1:1616\\. They said, \'But that also is, as it were, recondite. Make\nthyself rather an upper ara _n_ i of A _s_ vattha wood, and a lower ara _n_ i\nof A _s_ vattha wood: the fire which shall result therefrom will be that very\nfire.\'\n\n11:5:1:1717\\. He then made himself an upper ara _n_ i of A _s_ vattha wood,\nand a lower ara _n_ i of A _s_ vattha wood; and the fire which resulted\ntherefrom was that very fire: by offering therewith he became one of the\nGandharvas. Let him therefore make himself an upper and a lower ara _n_ i of A\n_s_ vattha wood, and the fire which results therefrom will be that very fire:\nby offering therewith he becomes one of the Gandharvas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[68:3](sbe44025.htm#fr_228) King Pururavas, of the lunar race of kings, is\nconsidered the p. 69 son of Budha (the planet Mercury, and son of Soma). On\nthis myth (based on the hymn _Ri_ g-veda S. X, 95) see Prof. Max Muller,\nOxford Essays (1856), p. 61 seqq.; (reprinted in Chips from a German Workshop,\nII, p. 102 seqq.); A. Kuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers and des Gottertranks, p. 81\nseqq. (2nd ed. p. 73 seqq.); Weber, Ind. Streifen I, p. 16 seqq.; K. F.\nGeldner, in Pischel and Geldner\'s Vedische Studien I, p. 244 seqq.; cf. H.\nOldenberg, Religion des Veda, p. 213.\n\n[69:1](sbe44025.htm#fr_229) Vaitasena da _n_ _d_ ena hatad,--vaitaso da _n_\n_d_ a _h_ pu _m_ vya _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ anasya nama; ukta _m_ hi Yaskena, _s_ epo vaitasa\niti pu _m_ spra _g_ ananasyeti (Nir. III, 22), Say.\n\n[69:2](sbe44025.htm#fr_230) Akama _m_ kamarahita _m_ suratabhilasharahita _m_\n_k_ a ma _m_ ma sma nipadyasai nig _ri_ hya ma _m_ prapnuya _h_ , Say.\n\n[69:3](sbe44025.htm#fr_231) The Gandharvas are the natural companions and\nmates of the Apsaras, or nymphs.\n\n[69:4](sbe44025.htm#fr_232) Literally, \'my son,\'--madiya _m_ putratvena svik\n_ri_ tam ura _n_ advayam, Say.\n\n[70:1](sbe44025.htm#fr_233) Cf. C. Gaedicke, Der Accusativ im Veda (1880), p.\n211. Previous translators had assigned the words \'punar emi\' (I come back) to\nUrva _s_ i; and in view of the corresponding passage in [paragraph\n13](sbe44025.htm#11:5:1:13), the new interpretation is just a little doubtful.\n\n[70:2](sbe44025.htm#fr_234) The text has \'ati,\' some kind of water-bird-- _g_\nala _k_ arapakshivi _s_ esha _h_ , Say.--(probably Gr. \xce\xbd\xe1\xbf\x86\xcf\x83\xcf\x83\xce\xb1; Lat. anas, anat-\nis; Anglo-S. aened, Germ. Ente).\n\n[70:3](sbe44025.htm#fr_235) That is, they became visible, or rather\nrecognisable to him by showing themselves in their real forms,--pakshirupa _m_\nvihaya svakiyena rupe _n_ a pradur babhuvu _h_ , Say.--In Kalidasa\'s plays,\nboth Urva _s_ i and _S_ akuntala become invisible by means of a magic veil\n(tiraskari _n_ i, \'making invisible\') with which has been compared the magic\nveil by which the swan-maidens change their form. A. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p.\n197; A. Kuhn, Herabkunft, p. 91.\n\n[70:4](sbe44025.htm#fr_236) Manasa tish _th_ a ghore,--possibly it may mean,\n\'O cruel one, be thou constant in (thy) mind;\' or, as Kuhn takes it, \'pay\nattention, O cruel one.\' Saya _n_ a, however, takes it as above.\n\n[71:1](sbe44025.htm#fr_237) This is a doubtful rendering (Max Muller;\nGespiele, A. Weber) of \'sudeva,\'--Gottergenoss (the companion of the gods),\nKuhn; \'dem die Gotter einst hold waren\' (he who was formerly favoured by the\ngods), Grassmann; Sudeva, Ludwig.\n\n[71:2](sbe44025.htm#fr_238) Or, will fall down (Max Muller, Weber); sich in\'s\nVerderben sturzen (will rush to his destruction), Kuhn;--forteilen (hasten\naway), Grassmann; verloren gehen (get lost), Ludwig; sich in den Abgrund\nsturzen, Geldner;--\'mahaprasthana _m_ kuryat\' (he will set out on the great\njourney, i.e. die), Saya _n_ a. The Brahma _n_ a seems to propose two\ndifferent renderings,--to throw oneself down (hang oneself), or, to start\nforth.\n\n[71:3](sbe44025.htm#fr_239) Nir _ri_ ti is the goddess of decay or death.\n\n[71:4](sbe44025.htm#fr_240) The meaning of \'salav _ri_ ka,\' also spelled \' _s_\nalav _ri_ ka\' (? house-wolves), is doubtful; cf. H. Zimmer, Altindisches\nLeben, p. 8. Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 413, makes the suggestion that\n\'wehrwolves\' may be intended.\n\n[72:1](sbe44025.htm#fr_241) The words \'ratri _h_ _s_ arada _s_ _k_ atasra _h_\n\' may also be taken in the sense of \'four nights of the autumn\' (Max Muller,\nA. Kuhn). It needs hardly to be remarked that \'nights\' means days and nights,\nand \'autumns\' years.--Saya _n_ a takes the passage in the sense of \'four\ndelightful (ratri _h_ ramayitri _h_ ) autumns or years.\'\n\n[72:2](sbe44025.htm#fr_242) Literally, I walk (or go on, keep) being satisfied\ntherewith. Prof. Geldner, however, takes it in an ironical sense, \'das Bischen\nliegt mir jetzt noch schwer im Magen\' (\'even now I have quite enough of that\nlittle\').\n\n[72:3](sbe44025.htm#fr_243) That is, the theologians of the _Ri_ g-veda. As\nProf. Weber points out, the hymn referred to, in the received version,\nconsists not of fifteen but of eighteen verses, three of which would therefore\nseem to be of later origin (though they might, of course, belong to a\ndifferent recension from that referred to by the Brahma _n_ a).\n\n[72:4](sbe44025.htm#fr_244) Or, according to Prof. Geldner, \'Then he touched\nher heart (excited her pity).\'\n\n[72:5](sbe44025.htm#fr_245) Literally, the yearliest night, i.e. the 360th\nnight, the last night of a year from now, or, this night next year: it is the\nnight that completes the year, just as \'the fifth\' completes the number\n\'five;\'--sa _m_ vatsaratami _m_ sa _m_ vatsarapura _n_ im antima _m_ ratrim,\nSay. Cf. Delbruck, Altind. Syntax, p. 195.\n\n[72:6](sbe44025.htm#fr_246) Hira _n_ yavimitani hira _n_ yanirmitani saudhani,\nSay.\n\n[73:1](sbe44025.htm#fr_247) Thus also A. Kuhn, and Saya _n_ a, tato hainam\nekam u _k_ ur etat, prapadyasveti,--enam Pururavasa _m_ tatratya _g_ ana idam\nekam u _k_ u _h_ , Say.--The word \'ekam\' might also be taken along with \'enam\'\n(Max Muller, Weber, Geldner),--\'they said this to him alone\' (? they bade him\nenter alone without his attendants).\n\n[73:2](sbe44025.htm#fr_248) See above, [paragraph 4](sbe44025.htm#11:5:1:4)\nand note on p. 70. According to the other interpretation we should have to\ntranslate:--He then deposited the fire in the forest, and went to the village\nwith the boy alone, thinking, \'I (shall) come back.\' [He came back] and lo! it\nhad disappeared.\n\n[74:1](sbe44025.htm#fr_249) That is, a churning-stick used for producing fire;\nsee part i, p. 275; p. 294, note 3.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 5, 2.
