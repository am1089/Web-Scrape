However,\nnobody is going to shush you if you make too much noise while using this site.\n\n**Q:** Who are you and what qualifies you to do this?  \n**A:** My name is John B. Hare, and I live in California. My academic\nbackground is in Linguistics, Anthropology and Computer Science, and I worked\nin the high technology field as a computer programmer and entrepreneur for\ntwenty five years prior to starting this site.\n\n**Q:** Why did you do it?  \n**A:** To do something nice for people.\n\n**Q:** Will you link to my site?  \n**A:** Sorry, but no. The site isn't about links, it's about texts.\n\n**Q:** Can I use stuff from this site?  \n**A:** Sure. Most of the site is not copyrighted. Some parts of the site are\ncopyrighted. Please don't copy those parts. Everything else, you can use for\nanything you can dream up.\n\n**Q:** Did you write all this stuff?  \n**A:** No. Most of it was written by dead people, a long time ago.\n\n* * *\n\n_Some take the name of the site a bit too literally. This leads to numerous\nmisconceptions:_\n\n**Q:** _Book X_ isn't at your site. Does that mean it is not a sacred text?  \n**A:** No. It may not be public domain, or we may not have got around to\nposting it. But omitting it from the site doesn't imply that we don't think it\nis or isn't a sacred-text.\n\n**Q:** _Book X_ is at your site. Does that mean that it is a sacred text?  \n**A:** No. Not everything at this site is a sacred text in the strict sense.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q:** But what do _you_ believe?  \n**A:** The site isn't about me, it's about the texts.\n\n**Q:** I want you to promote my book/website/guru.  \n**A:** Sorry. That is not our mission.\n\n**Q:** Can I advertise at this website?  \n**A:** Sure, go to Google, and sign up for the [Google AdWords\nprogram](http://www.google.com/intl/en/ads/). Google AdWords is the only way\nto place an advertisement at the site. IMPORTANT: If you have any questions\nabout Google AdWords, please direct those to Google's support staff, not this\nsite.\n\n**Q:** I want you to place a text ad at your site, but don't want to use\nGoogle's AdWords, can't you make an exception.  \n**A:** Sorry. Sign up for the Google AdWords program if you want to advertise\nat this site.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q:** What are appropriate things to email sacred-texts about?  \n**A:** Please be considerate as we get a lot of email. Here are some examples:\n\n|\n\n_APPROPRIATE_\n\n|\n\n_NOT APPROPRIATE_  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n\n\nLocations of typos, broken links, or bugs in scripts (be sure to specify the\nURL).\n\nSuggestions for new public domain texts to post or topics to cover.\n\nFactual errors on index pages.\n\nGeneral questions about the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM.\n\nTechnical support issues about the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM.\n\nQuestions about the status of an order or shipment for the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM\nand other sales related email.\n\nVolunteering to scan or proof texts.\n\nLicensing inquiries.\n\nRequests to remove or alter a text if you own the copyright.\n\n|\n\n\n\n_Questions already answered in this FAQ_.\n\nQuestions about personal problems, spiritual advice, etc.\n\nRequests to post copyrighted texts if you are not the copyright holder.\n\nRequests to remove, censor or alter texts.\n\nRequests for rights clearance of public domain material.\n\nQuestions about spiritual, esoteric, legal or medical issues of any kind.\n\nGenealogical questions.\n\nRequests to translate Latin, Sumerian, Sanskrit, etc.\n\nBook, artifact, or jewelry appraisals.\n\nHelp with homework or research questions.\n\nRequests for link exchanges.\n\nTheories of everything (unless you're Stephen Hawking!).\n\nAbusive email: rants, trolling, flaming, griefing, scams, etc.\n\n  \n  \n**Q:** How do you determine the public domain status of a book?  \n**A:**\n\nCOPYRIGHT POLICY\n\nYear of publication:\n\n|\n\nPUBLISHED OUTSIDE US\n\n|\n\nPUBLISHED IN US  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nBefore January 1st, 1923\n\n|\n\nPUBLIC DOMAIN\n\n|\n\nPUBLIC DOMAIN  \n  \nBetween 1923 and 1963, inclusive\n\n|\n\nNOT PUBLIC DOMAIN\n\n|\n\nPUBLIC DOMAIN if the copyright was not renewed in a timely fashion.  \n  \nAfter 1963\n\n|\n\nNOT PUBLIC DOMAIN\n\n|\n\nNOT PUBLIC DOMAIN  \n  \nAnything published by the US Government Printing Office is also public domain\nin the US, regardless of the year of publication.\n\nThis is based on US Copyright law, since we are physically located in the US.\nWe need some very compelling reasons to post anything outside of these\nparameters.\n\n**Q:** How can I volunteer to help build the site?  \n**A:** Click on 'Volunteer' in the left hand menu on this page.\n\n**Q:** I have a text to submit to the site, what file format do you want?  \n**A:** Anything but PDF! The file has to be converted into HTML to be posted\nat the site, and so it needs to be something that Microsoft Word can read:\nRTF, DOC, TXT, etc. PDF files can't be converted into HTML easily.\n\n**Q:** Can I link to this website?  \n**A:** Sure, you have my permission.\n\n**Q:** Why won't you exchange links with my website?  \n**A:** We do add links to other sites occasionally but that is usually because\nthey have a mission and content which is similar to this site, or have helped\nus in some fashion. Usually these show up on our radar long before anyone\ncontacts us about them. And those sites are very rare.\n\n**Q:** Can you add a link to _X_?  \n**A:** This site is preponderantly about content rather than links. We would\nrather add a whole etext than one link. For one thing, links are hard to\nmaintain. There was a link at this site which we added in attribution to the\ncontributor of an etext; a year later the domain expired and was taken over by\na porn operator. We didn't know that until an attentive reader emailed us, and\nof course we took the link down quickly. We are reluctant to add links\ncasually.\n\n**Q:** Do I have to pay you to use the public domain material from your\nwebsite at mine?  \n**A:** No.\n\n**Q:** Can I use the public domain material from your site in my book?  \n**A:** You have my permission.\n\n**Q:** I want to pay you a reasonable fee for commercial use of material from\nthe site even though I'm aware that the content is in the public domain.  \n**A:** Thanks! Please contact us for licensing information. We can provide\nhigh resolution images and master files in most cases.\n\n**Q:** My publisher wants you to clear the copyright on public domain material\nfrom your site which I've quoted in my book.  \n**A:** Sorry, we have no legal authority to do this because the copyright has\nexpired and we did not own it even when it was in force. If you need a legal\nopinion on the copyright status of a work please ask a copyright lawyer.\n\n**Q:** I'm looking for a particular book.  \n**A:** See the books page (click on 'Books' in the left hand menu on this\npage).\n\n**Q:** Please add _Urantia_ , _Course in Miracles_ , Scientology, the\nUnification Church, Soka Gakkai, The Church of Satan, the _Kolbrin_ , etc.  \n**A:** Sorry. We can't because the copyrights for these texts haven't expired\nyet by our copyright policy (see the COPYRIGHT POLICY chart above). It doesn't\nmean we don't respect these belief systems, just that we would get in big\nlegal trouble if we added their texts. However, if you are the copyright\nholder of one of these books, and want it published at sacred-texts for free\ndistribution on the Internet, please contact us, **principals only** (i.e.,\ndon't make such a proposal if you are not the copyright holder or their\nrepresentative).\n\n**Q:** Please add the _Gospel of Judas_ , the Dead Sea Scrolls, The Qumran\ntexts, etc.  \n**A:** No public domain translation of any of these texts exists, as far as we\nknow.\n\n**Q:** But you cover Neo-Paganism, isn't that recent?  \n**A:** This is a bit different. Even though Neo-Paganism itself is\ncomparatively recent (post-World War II), it emerged from historical belief\nsystems. There are numerous books in the public domain about these belief\nsystems, as can be seen on the Neo-Paganism page. Furthermore, there is no\ncentralized institution which runs Neo-Paganism, and numerous individual Neo-\nPagans have shown a willingness to release their copyrighted documents for\nfree electronic redistribution, as can be seen in the Internet Book of\nShadows. This is in contrast to the Urantia Foundation and Scientology, which\nhave vigorously used copyright lawsuits to attempt to restrict or control\nelectronic redistribution of their materials. This is not a value judgment\nabout Urantia or Scientology, simply a statement of fact.\n\nFunny story actually.... I was actually contacted by a very testy lawyer from\nthe Scientologists at one point. She was more than a bit bothered that I\nrefused to post anything about them, until I pointed out that they had sued\neveryone aggressively for posting proprietary material about them for years,\nand now they expected me to cover them? She finally admitted that I had a\npoint there...\n\n**Q:** Why all the short files? I want to download the entire book in one\nfile!  \n**A:** Sorry. The short files are for technical reasons which greatly reduce\nthe cost of hosting the site. Newer books typically have a one-file text-only\nversion, which is optimized for screen reader software. Look for the links on\nthe index pages that say 'Text' [Zipped]\n\n**Q:** Examples of what material at the site is not in the public domain?  \n**A:** This includes (but is not limited to) the following. Any page with an\nexplicit copyright notice. Any page named 'index.htm,' or filling the role of\nan 'index.htm' file. Any introductory material which I've written with a\nbyline, (or not), specifically the short descriptions on the category index\npages and the introductory essays on the book index pages. Any image (graphics\nfile) specifically labeled as copyrighted, e.g. the 'Standing Stones' graphic.\nMaterial derived from bulletin board postings or contributed by the author,\nspecifically material indexed in the Internet Book of Shadows, Zen Buddhism,\nTibetan Buddhism, and the UFO files sections. Any JavaScript program,\nspecifically the Tarot card reader, the pages in the Calendars section, and\nthe site catalog.\n\n**Q:** I want the entire site translated.  \n**A:** The site is so massive, it is impractical to do so. You can machine-\ntranslate the site online using any babelfish service. (click on 'Translate'\nin the left hand menu on this page)\n\n**Q:** What is B.C.E. and C.E.?  \n**A:** Before Common Era and Common Era. These are the same as B.C. (Before\nChrist) and A.D. (Anno Domini\xc2\x97'Year of our Lord' in Latin). Since the purpose\nof this site is to serve readers of all religions I have adopted this\nterminology because not everyone uses the birth of Christ as a reference\npoint. The dates correspond to the civil calendar used by most Western\ncountries. However, where B.C. and A.D. occur in scanned texts, I have not\naltered them.\n\n**Q:** Why only ten volumes of the Talmud?  \n**A:** This was as much as the translator (Rodkinson) was able to publish\nprior to 1923 (or ever). The first complete English translation was not\npublished until 1930 in London, which puts it off-limits in terms of our\ncopyright policy.\n\n**Q:** If you are having trouble hosting the site, why not use a free hosting\nservice?  \n**A:** They would have to pay the same amount to host these files, so that\nwouldn't solve anything.\n\n**Q:** Why not get grants to fund the site?  \n**A:** That would be incompatible with our tax status.\n\n**Q:** Why not distribute the site solely through bittorrent?  \n**A:** The site is meant to be accessible to everyone with a web browser.\nDownloading, installing, and fine-tuning bittorrent is beyond the capability\nof the casual Internet users who are the vast majority of this site's\naudience.\n\n**Q:** Do you have any banners I can use?  \n**A:** Sure, there are two banners you can download from the following URLs to\nput at your site: http://www.sacred-texts.com/stban.gif and http://www.sacred-\ntexts.com/stauxban.gif.\n\n**Q:** Someone is selling the Internet Book of Shadows on EBay.  \n**A:** This was a bit of a problem until I posted the entire IBOS in a zip\nfile. It still occurs, and there is still little that can be done about it.\n\n**Q:** Where is the Jewish Publication Society Bible?  \n**A:** We are redoing the text which was previously posted, for legal reasons.\nEach book will be posted as it is complete at http://www.sacred-\ntexts.com/bib/jps/index.htm. It will also be incorporated into the Tanach\n(Hebrew Bible) section when complete.\n\n**Q:** Can you post book _X_ so I can read it before midterms?  \n**A:** Sorry, I can't guarantee the date I'll post any specific book. Normally\nI have a very long queue of items to scan and proof, so if you ask me today,\nit could be months or years before it actually appears at the site.\n\n**Q:** I thought there was a copyright exemption for religious texts, why so\npicky about copyrights?  \n**A:** That's an urban legend.\n\n**Q:** Why don't you post [some text]. Of course it is in the public domain,\nit can be found posted all over the web!  \n**A:** That means nothing. People pirate copyrighted material on the web all\nthe time. If you see a text elsewhere on the Internet, even if the site claims\nthat it is in the public domain, that is no indication as to its actual\ncopyright status.\n\n**Q:** Why are you publishing Masonic secrets?  \n**A:** All text at this site in the Freemasonry section is from public domain\nbooks, most of which have been in print for over a century. For instance, my\ncopy of Duncan's Ritual was purchased off-the-shelf at a large chain\nbookstore. So these are hardly secret anymore, and hence it makes no sense to\nblame this site for publishing these texts.\n\n**Q:** Why are you publishing tribal secrets?  \n**A:** All of these books have been sitting on library shelves for, in most\ncases, over a century.\n\n**Q:** Will the world end in 2012?  \n**A:** Probably not.\n\n**Q:** What about the quiz?  \n**A:** There is no quiz. Nor is there any cake.  \n  \n|  |  [![](cdshop/img/t_istadvd.jpg)  \nNow Shipping!
