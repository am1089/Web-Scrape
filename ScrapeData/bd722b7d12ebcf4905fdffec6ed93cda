On account of the subject-matter.\n\nThe highest Self constitutes the subject-matter (of the entire chapter), as we\nsee from the passage, 'Sir, what is that through which, when it is known,\neverything else becomes known?' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 3) in which the knowledge of\neverything is declared to be dependent on the knowledge of one thing. For all\nthis (i.e. the entire world) becomes known if Brahman the Self of all is\nknown, not if only the individual soul is known.--Another reason against the\nindividual soul follows.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 7](sbe34076.htm)\n\n"
