Who are you, O men, the very best, who have approached one by one, from\nthe furthest distance [1](sbe3243.htm#an_5:61:1:1)?\n\n2\\. Where are your horses, where the bridles? How could you, how did you come?\n--the seat on the back, the rein in the nostrils?\n\n3\\. Their goad is on the croup [1](sbe3243.htm#an_5:61:3:1), the heroes\nstretched their legs apart [2](sbe3243.htm#an_5:61:3:2)\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n4\\. Move along, heroes, young men, the sons of an excellent mother\n[1](sbe3243.htm#an_5:61:4:1), so that you may warm yourselves at our fire\n[2](sbe3243.htm#an_5:61:4:2).\n\n5\\. (1.) May the woman, if she stretched out her arm\n[1](sbe3243.htm#an_5:61:5:1) as a rest for the hero, praised by _S_ yava _s_\nva [2](sbe3243.htm#an_5:61:5:2), gain cattle consisting of horses, cows, and a\nhundred sheep.\n\n6\\. (2.) Many a woman is even more often kindlier than a godless and miserly\nman,\n\n7\\. (3.) A woman who finds out the weak, the thirsty, the needy, and is\nmindful of the gods.\n\n8\\. (4.) Even though many an unpraiseworthy miser (Pa _n_ i) is called a man,\nshe is worth as much in weregild.\n\n9\\. (5.) Also the young woman joyfully whispered to me, to _S_ yava, the road,\n--and the two bays went straight to Purumi _lh_ a\n[1](sbe3243.htm#an_5:61:9:1), the wise, the far-famed,\n\n10\\. (6.) Who gave me a hundred cows, like Vaidada _s_ vi, like Taranta, in\nmagnificence.\n\n11\\. (1.) The Maruts, who drive on their quick horses, drinking the delightful\nmead, have gained glory here;\n\np. 357\n\n12\\. (2.) They on whose chariots Rodasi [1](sbe3243.htm#an_5:61:12:1) glitters\nin glory [2](sbe3243.htm#an_5:61:12:2), like the golden disk above in heaven;\n\n13\\. (3.) That youthful company of the Maruts, with blazing chariots,\nblameless, triumphant, irresistible.\n\n14\\. (4.) Who now knows of them where the strikers rejoice, the well-born, the\nfaultless?\n\n15\\. (5.) You who are fond of praise, become the leaders of the mortal,\nlistening to his imploring invocations, thus is my thought\n[1](sbe3243.htm#an_5:61:15:1).\n\n16\\. (6.) Bring then to us delightful and resplendent\n[1](sbe3243.htm#an_5:61:16:1) treasures, ye worshipful Maruts, destroyers of\nenemies.\n\n17\\. (1.) O night, like a charioteer, carry away this hymn to Darbhya, and\nthese songs, O goddess.\n\n18\\. (2.) And then tell him thus from me, \'When Rathaviti offers Soma, my\ndesire never goes away from me.\'\n\n19\\. (3.) That mighty Rathaviti dwells among people rich in cattle\n[1](sbe3243.htm#an_5:61:19:1), retired among the mountains.\n\np. 358\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is of a very composite nature. It is addressed to the Maruts by _S_\nyava _s_ va. According to the Anukrama _n_ i, however, the Maruts are\naddressed in vv. 1-4, 11-16 only; vv. 5-8 are addressed to _S_ a _s_ iyasi\nTarantamahishi, 9 to Purumi _lh_ a Vaidada _s_ vi, 10 to Taranta Vaidada _s_\nvi, 17-19 to Rathaviti Darbhya. None of the verses occurs in SV., VS., AV.,\nTS., TB., MS. Metre, 1-4, 6-8, 10-19 Gayatri; 5 Anush _t_ ubh; 9 Satob _ri_\nhati.\n\nIt has been pointed out that in the hymns addressed to the Maruts beginning\nwith V, 52, and ending with V, 60, there is the usual decrease in the number\nof verses of each successive hymn, viz. 17, 16, 15, 10, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8. Our\nhymn, however, which is the last in the collection of hymns addressed by _S_\nyava _s_ va to the Maruts, breaks the rule, and it has been suggested with\ngreat plausibility that it contains a number of verses thrown together at\nrandom. Possibly the four verses in the beginning formed an independent hymn,\naddressed to the Maruts, and again 5-10, and 11-16, followed by an appendix,\n17-19. These verses refer to a legend which will have to be discussed at verse\n5.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. As to paramasya _h_ paravata _h_ , see TS. IV, 1, 9, 3, where we also\nfind (IV, 1, 9, 2) parasya adhi sa _m_ vata _h_.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. _G_ aghane, like _g_ aghanata _h_ , may mean simply behind, as agre\nand agrata _h_ mean before.\n\nNote 2. It is clear that the Maruts are here supposed to sit astride on their\nhorses. This is also shown by p _ri_ sh _th_ e sadas (v. 2), and by putrak\n_ri_ the na _g_ anaya _h_ , they stretched out their legs, \xe1\xbd\xa1\xcf\x82 \xce\xb3\xcf\x85\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xe1\xbf\x96\xce\xba\xce\xb5\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xbd\n\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xce\xba\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xce\xaf\xe1\xbe\xb3. Zimmer (p. 230) says, \'Zum Reiten wurde das Ross nicht benutzt.\'\nOn p. 295 he modifies this by saying, \'Keine einzige klare Stelle des Rig-veda\nist mir bekannt, wo das Reiten beim Kampfe erwahnt wurde; man fahrt immer zu\nWagen, wie die Griechen in homerischen Zeiten.\'\n\np. 359\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Bhadra _g_ anaya _h_ , generally rendered by \'possessed of beautiful\nwives,\' seems really to mean \'possessed of an excellent mother.\' _G_ ani\nclearly means mother, when Agni dvimata, having two mothers, is called dvi _g_\nani _h_ ; for it is never said that he has two wives. Besides, the Maruts are\nconstantly addressed as the sons of their mother, P _ri_ _s_ ni, while their\nwives are mentioned but rarely. However, the other meaning is not impossible.\nSee also Bergaigne, II, 387 seq.\n\nNote 2. The fire here intended is, I suppose, the sacrificial fire, to which\nthe Maruts are here invited as they had been in former hymns.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Ludwig compares the A. S. expression healsgebedde; see also RV. X, 10,\n10.\n\nNote 2. I have very little belief in the legends which are told in the Brahma\n_n_ as and in the Anukrama _n_ i in illustration of certain apparently\npersonal and historical allusions in the hymns of the Veda. It is clear in\nmany cases that they are made up from indications contained in the hymns. as\nin IX, 58, 3, and it seems best therefore to forget them altogether in\ninterpreting the words of the Vedic hymns.\n\nThe story told in the introductory verses, quoted by Saya _n_ a, is this:--\'Ar\n_k_ ananas \xc3\x82treya was chosen by Rathaviti Darbhya to be his _Ri_ tvi _g_\npriest. At the sacrifice Ar _k_ ananas saw the daughter of Rathaviti and asked\nher in marriage for his son _S_ yava _s_ va. Rathaviti consulted his wife, but\nshe declined on the ground that no daughter of theirs had ever been given to a\nman who was not a poet ( _Ri_ shi). Thereupon _S_ yava _s_ va performed\npenance, and travelled about collecting alms. He thus came to _S_ a _s_ iyasi,\nwho recommended him, as a _Ri_ shi, to her husband, king Taranta. King Taranta\nwas very generous to him, and sent him on to his younger brother, Purumi _lh_\na. On his way to Purumi _lh_ a, _S_ yava _s_ va saw the Maruts, and composed a\nhymn in their praise (vv. 11-16). He had thus become a real poet or _Ri_ shi,\nand on returning home, he received from Rathaviti his daughter in marriage.\'\n\np. 360\n\n_S_ aunaka confirms the same story, see Saya _n_ a\'s commentary to V, 61, 17.\nHere therefore we have to deal with two princely brothers, both Vaidada _s_\nvis, namely Taranta and Purumi _lh_ a. They both give presents to _S_ yava _s_\nva, who is a Brahma _n_ a, and he marries the daughter of another prince,\nRathaviti Darbhya.\n\nIn the Ta _n_ _d_ ya-Brahma _n_ a, however, XIII, 7, 12, another story is\ntold, which I quoted in my edition of the Rig-veda at IX, 58, 3 (vol. v, p.\nxxxiii). Here Dhvasra and Purushanti are introduced as wishing to give\npresents to the two Vaidada _s_ vis, Taranta and Purumi _lh_ a. These hesitate\nfor a while, because they have no right to accept a present without deserving\nit or having done something for it. They then compose a hymn in praise of\nDhvasra and Purushanti, and after that feel justified in accepting their\npresent.\n\nHere therefore the Vaidada _s_ vis are receivers, not givers of presents,\ntherefore of princely, not, as has been supposed, of priestly rank, and this\nwould agree better with the words of verse 9, purumi _lh_ a\xc2\xb4ya vipraya. See on\nall this Oldenberg in Z. D. M. G. XLII, p. 232.\n\nIf we accept this story, we have to take _s_ a _s_ iyasi in verse 6 as a\nproper name.\n\nBut _s_ a _s_ iyasi may be a comparative of _s_ a _s_ -vat (see B.-R. s. v.),\nand would then mean, more frequent. We expect, no doubt, an adverb rather like\n_s_ a _s_ vat, but a feminine corresponding to vasyasi is perhaps admissible.\nIn that case we should have simply to deal with some woman, tva stri\xc2\xb4, who, as\nthe poet says, is as good as, if not better than, many a man.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nThis verse is very obscure. Saya _n_ a translates: \'And the other half (the\nhusband of _S_ a _s_ iyasi, viz. Taranta) is a man not praised (enough), thus\nI, the poet, say: and that Taranta is equal or just in the giving of wealth.\'\nGrassmann translates: \'Und dagegen ist mancher nicht lobenswerth geizig, der\nein Mann sich nennt, ein solcher ist der Strafe verfallen.\' Ludwig: \'Auch\nmancher halbmensch,\n\np. 361\n\nungepriesen, der "mensch" zwar heiszt, doch ein Pa _n_ i ist, der ist auf bose\ngabe nur bedacht.\'\n\nThe first light that was thrown on this verse came from Prof. Roth. He showed\n(Z. D. M. G. XLI, p. 673) that vairadeya means weregild, the German wergelt,\nthe price to be given for a man killed. Vaira would here be derived from vira,\nman, the Goth. wair, the Latin vir, and vairadeya would mean what is to be\ngiven as the value of a man. Still I doubt whether Prof. Roth has discovered\nthe true meaning of the verse. He translates: \'So ist auch mancher Mann nicht\nzu loben, mehr ein Pa _n_ i (unfromm, gegen die Gotter karg, zugleich\nBezeichnung habsuchtiger Damonen), obschon man ihn einen Menschen nennt--nur\nam Wergeld steht er den andern gleich.\' I confess I do not see much point in\nthis. It is quite clear that the poet praises a charitable woman, and wishes\nto say that she is sometimes better than a man, if he gives nothing. Now the\nweregild, if we may say so, for women was generally, though not always, less\nthan that for men, and I therefore propose to read sa\xc2\xb4 vairadeye it sama\xc2\xb4, and\ntranslate: \'Even though many an unpraiseworthy miser (Pa _n_ i) is called man,\nshe is like him in weregild, i. e. she is worth as much, even though she is a\nwoman.\' On uta, see Delbruck, Syntaktische Forschungen, V, p. 528.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Purumi _lh_ a is here clearly the man from whom benefits are expected,\nand therefore could not be the same as Purumi _lh_ a Vaidada _s_ vi, mentioned\nby the commentator, who accepted gifts from Dhvasra and Purushanti. Nor can\nTaranta Vaidada _s_ vi in the next verse be taken for a recipient, but only\nfor a giver, and therefore, most likely, a prince. The whole story, however,\nis by no means clear, and I doubt whether the commentator drew his information\nfrom any source except his own brain.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nI agree with Ludwig that a new hymn begins with verse 11.\n\np. 362\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. I have adopted the reading Rodasi\xc2\xb4 vibhra\xc2\xb4 _g_ ate in my translation;\ncf. VI, 66, 6, where Rodasi is compared with a roka _h_.\n\nNote 2. Roth (K. Z. XXVI, 51) takes _s_ riya\xc2\xb4dhi as _s_ riyas adhi, but such a\nsandhi has not yet been established in the hymns of the Rig-veda, see\nOldenberg, Proleg. p. 459, Anm. 1. Oldenberg himself suggests _s_ riyo\xe0\xa4\xbddhi,\nand would translate, \'They whose charms shine over the two worlds on their\nchariots.\' Pischel (Ved. Stud. p. 54) translates yesham _s_ riya\xc2\xb4 by \'for\nwhose sake.\'\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. On ittha\xc2\xb4 dhiya\xc2\xb4, see Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 184.\n\n##### Verse 16.\n\nNote 1. The Pada ought to have puru- _k_ andra\xc2\xb4, as suggested by Grassmann and\nLudwig.\n\n##### Verses 17-19.\n\nThese verses are very peculiar, and may refer to historical events, for\nDalbhya or Darbhya and Rathaviti sound like real names. Of course the Indian\ncommentators are never at a loss to tell us what it all refers to, but we can\nnever say how little they knew, and how much they invented. The invocation of\n\xc3\x9brmya, if it is meant for the Night, and the request that she may convey the\nhymn to Darbhya, is different from the usual style of the hymns. See, however,\nVIII, 24, 28, and Oldenberg, Z. D. M. G. XXXIX, 89.\n\nThe following names, occurring in our hymn, have the sanction of the Anukrama\n_n_ i: _S_ a _s_ iyasi Tarantamahishi (V, 61, 5; 8), Purumi _lh_ a Vaidada _s_\nvi (V, 61, 9), Taranta Vaidada _s_ vi (V, 61, 10), Rathaviti Dalbhya (V, 61,\n17-19). There is another Purumi _lh_ a, a Sauhotra, in IV, 43, and a Purumi\n_lh_ a \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa in VIII, 71.\n\n##### Verse 19.\n\nNote 1. See Oldenberg, Z. D. M. G. XXXIX, 89. He corrects gomati _h_ to\ngomatim, the name of a river, mentioned in a very similar way in VIII, 24, 30.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 87. To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)](sbe3244.htm)\n\n'
