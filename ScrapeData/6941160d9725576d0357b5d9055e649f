S\'ri Devi said :-- "O Himalayas! Thus making one\'s own self attached to\nthe Yoga by the above-mentioned process and sitting on a Yoga posture, one\nshould meditate on My Brahma Nature with\n\np. 723\n\nan unfeigned devotion. (How the knowledge of that Formless Existence and\nImperishable Brahman arises, now hear.) He is manifest, near, yea, even moving\nin the hearts of all beings. He is the well-known Highest Goal. Know that all\nthis whatever, waking, dreaming, or sleeping, which moves, breathes or blinks,\nis founded on Him. He is higher than Being and Non-being: higher than the\nWisdom, He is the Best Object of adoration for all creatures. He is brilliant,\nsmaller than the smallest and in Him the worlds are founded and the Rulers\nthereof. He is the Imperishable Brahman. He is the Creator (Life), the\nRevealer of Sacred Knowledge (speech) and Omniscient (or the Cosmic Mind).\nThis is the Truth. He is immortal, O Saumya! Know that He is the target to be\nhit.\n\n_Note_. -- The words "higher than wisdom" mean higher than Brahma. (Brahma is\nthe highest of all Jivas, higher than Brahma means higher than all creatures.\nThe word Vij\xc3\xb1ana denotes Brahma as we find in the following speech of Brahma\nin the Bhagavat Pura _n_ a) "I, the Wisdom Energy (Vij\xc3\xb1ana-S\'akti) was born\nfrom the navel of this Being resting on the Waters and possessed of the\nInfinite Powers."\n\nVi _sn_ u is called "Pra _n_ a," because he is the leader of all (Pra _n_\na-netri). He is called Vak, because He is the Teacher of all; Vi _sn_ u is\ncalled Manas because He is the adviser of all (Man _t_ ri). He is the\nController of all the Jivas.\n\nThe third verse lays down that Brahman is to be meditated upon or that the\nManana should be performed; as the second verse teaches that Dhyana or\nconcentration also is necessary.\n\n5-6. Take hold of the Mystic Name as the bow, and know that the Brahman is the\naim to be hit. Put on this the great weapon (Om), the arrow (of the mind)\nsharpened by meditation. Withdraw thyself from all objects, and with the mind\nabsorbed in the idea of Brahman, hit the aim; for know, O Saumya! That\nImperishable alone to be the Mark. The Great name"Om" is the bow, the mind is\nthe arrow, and the Brahman is said to be the mark. It is to be hit by a man\nwhose thoughts are concentrated, for then he enters the target.\n\n_Note_. -- Thus S\'rava _n_ a, Manana, and Dhyana of Brahman have been taught.\nThis is the method of Brahma-upasana.\n\n7\\. In Him are woven the heavens, and the interspaces, and mingle also with\nthe senses. Know Him to be the one Support of all, the\n\np. 724\n\n\xc3\x82tman. Leave off all other words (as well as the worship of other deities).\nThis (\xc3\x82tman) is the refuge of the Immortals.\n\n"He is the bridge of the Immortal"--the words Amrita or Immortal means Mukta\nJivas. In the Vedanta Sutra I, 3-2, it has been taught that the Lord is the\nrefuge of the Muktas. So also that "He is the Highest Goal of the Muktas."\n\n8-9. In Him the life-webs (na _d_ is) are fastened, as the spokes to the nave\nof a chariot; He is this (\xc3\x82tman) that pervades the heart, and by his own free\nwill manifests Himself in diverse ways (as Visva, Taijasa, etc., in waking,\nsleeping, etc., states); and also as One as Praj\xc3\xb1a in the dreamless state.\nMeditate on the \xc3\x82tman as Om (full of all auspicious qualities and who is the\nchief aim of the Vedas), in order to acquire the knowledge of the Paramatman,\nWho is beyond the Prak _r_ iti and the S\'ri Tattva. Your welfare consists in\nsuch knowledge.\n\n_Note_. -- This shows that Brahman is the Antaryamin Puru _s_ a. He resides in\nthe heart where all the 72,000 Na _d_ is meet, as the spokes meet in the navel\nof the wheel. He moves within the organs, not for His own pleasure, but to\ngive life and energy to them all. The Om with all its attributes must be\nconstantly meditated upon. He manifests Himself in manifold ways in the waking\nand dreaming stews as Vis\'va and Taijasa; while He manifests as One in the\nstate of Su _s_ upti or Dreamless sleep as Praj\xc3\xb1a. He is beyond darkness; He\nhas no mortal body. Meditate on such Vi _sn_ u in the heart in order to get\nthe Supreme Brahman, with the help of the Mantra Om. The result of such\nmeditation is that there is the welfare of yours--all evils will cease, and\nyou will get the bliss of the manifestation of the Divinity--your Real Self\nwithin your Heart.\n\n10\\. He who is All-Wise, and All-Knowing, whose Greatness is thus manifested\nin the worlds, is to be meditated upon as the \xc3\x82tman residing in the Ether, in\nthe Fourth Dimensional Space, in the shining city of Brahman (the Heart). He\nis the Controller of the mind and the Guide of the senses and the body. He\nabides in the dense body, controlling the heart. He, the \xc3\x82tman, when\nmanifesting Himself as the Blissful and Immortal, is seen by the wise through\nthe purity of the heart.\n\n11\\. The fetters of the Jivas are cut asunder, the ties of Linga-dehas and\nPrak _r_ iti are removed (the effects of all) his works perish, when He is\nseen who is Supremely High (or when the Supremely High looks at the Jiva.) [\n_Note_.--Vi _sn_ u is Paravare, because Para or High Beings like Rama;\nBrahmas, etc., are Avara or inferior in His comparsion.]\n\np. 725\n\n [ _Note_. -- This shows the result of Divine Wisdom in the last verse. The\nAvidya covers both \xc3\x8es\'vara and Jiva. It prevents \xc3\x8es\'vara being, seen by Jiva,\nand Jiva, seeing \xc3\x8es\'vara. It is a direct bondage of Jiva and a metaphorical\nfetter of \xc3\x8es\'vara. Avidya is the name given to Prak _r_ iti in Her active\nstate. When Her three qualities Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, are actively\nmanifest. Destruction of Avidya means putting these Gu _n_ as in their latent\nstate. There is a great difference between the destruction of the\nAvidya\\--fetters as taught in this verse, and the unloosening of them as\npreviously described in this verse! There Avidya still remained, for it was\nmerely a Parok _s_ a or intellectual apprehension of Truth. Here Avidya itself\nis destroyed by Aparok _s_ a or Intuitive Knowledge of Brahman.\n\nThe bonds are five :-- The lowest is the Avidya bond, then the Lingadeha bond,\nthen the Pramachchadaka Prak _r_ iti bond, the Kama bond, and the Karma bond.\nWhen all these bonds are destroyed, then the J\xc3\xb1ani goes by the Path of Light\nto the Santamka Loka. Before proceeding further all have to salute the\nS\'is\'u-mara--the Dweller on the threshhold--the hub of the Universe.\n\nThe Sis\'umara literally means the Infant Killer and means the porpoise and is\nthe name of a constellation, in the north, near the Pole. It corresponds\nperhaps with the Draco or the Ursa Minor. For a fuller description of it, see\nBhagam Pura _n_ a Book 5, Chapter 23. Here it is a mystical reference to a\nBeing of an exalted order, which every J\xc3\xb1ani passes by, in his way beyond this\nUniverse. It may correspond with the ring-pass-not of the \'Secret Doctrine\'!\nIt is the name of Hari, also, as we find the following verse "The Supreme\nHari, the Support of infinity of worlds and who is called Sis\'umara, is\nsaluted by all knowers of Brahma, on their way to the Supreme God.]\n\n12\\. The Brahman (called Sis\'umaram) free from all passions and parts\n(manifests in the external world) in the highest Golden Sheath (the Cosmic\nEgg). That is pure, that is the highest of Lights, it is that which the\nknowers of \xc3\x82tman know. [ _Note_. -- "He is in the Centre of the Cosmic (as\nSis\'umara, the Light of all Cosmic Suns). He is even in the centre of our Sun\nand illumining all planets."]\n\nIn the first respect He is meditated upon as Sis\'umara and in the second as\nGayatri." [ _Note_.--In man, the Brahman manifests in the heart or the Auric\nEgg, called the city of Brahman. In the Universe, He manifests Himself in the\nCosmic Egg, called the "Golden Sheath." These are the two places where Brahman\nmay be meditated upon.\n\np. 726\n\nThis verse has been explained in two different ways: First, as applying to\nS\'is\'umara and secondly, as teaching how to meditate on Naraya _n_ a in the\nSun. The "Golden Sheath" would then mean the Solar sphere. The Supremely High\nBrahman resides in the excellent Golden Sheath. He is Pure and Without parts.]\n\n13\\. The Sun does not shine there in His Presence nor the Moon and the Stars\n(for His Light is greater than theirs, they appear as if dark in that\nEffulgence, like the candle-light in the Sun. Nor do these lightnings, and\nmuch less this fire shine there. When He shines, everything shines after Him;\nby His Light all this becomes manifest.\n\nHim the Sun does not illumine nor the moon and the stars. Nor do these\nlightnings; much less this Fire illumines Him. When He illumines all (the Sun,\netc.,) then they shine after (Him with His light). This whole Universe reveals\nHis Light (is His Light and its Light is His). _Note_.--The Sun, etc., do not\nillumine Him, _i.e._ , cannot make Him manifest.\n\n14\\. The Eternally Free is verily this Brahman only. He is in the West, in the\nNorth and the South, in the Zenith and the Nadir. The Brahman alone is; it is\nHe who pervades all directions. This Brahman alone is it who pervades. This\nBrahman alone is the Full (that exists in all time the Eternity). This Brahman\nis the Best:--\n\nThis (idam) Brahman is alone the Vis\'vam or Infinity or Full (pur _n_ am).\nThis alone is the Best, the Highest of all. As the word "idam" is used several\ntimes in this verse, it qualifies the word Brahman and not "vis\'vam," [\n_Note_.--The Brahman was taught to be meditated upon fully in the Heart and\nthe Hira _n_ maya Kos\'a. But lest one should mistake that He is thus limited\nin those two places, one is to infer that they are selected as the best.]\n\n15-16. The man who realises thus is satisfied and has all that he wants to do\nand is considered as the best. He becomes Brahman and his Self is pleased and\nhe neither wants anything nor becomes sorry. O King! Fear comes from the idea\nof a second; where there is no second, fear does not exist. No danger then\narises for him to be separated from Me. Nor I also get separated from him.\n\n17\\. O Himalayas! Know that I am he and he is I. Know that I am seen there\nwhere My J\xc3\xb1ani resides.\n\n18\\. Neither I dwell in any sacred place of pilgrimage, nor do I live in\nKailasa nor in Vaiku _nt_ ha nor in any other place. I dwell in the heart\nlotus of My J\xc3\xb1ani.\n\np. 727\n\n19\\. The blessed man who worships once My J\xc3\xb1ani, gets Ko _t_ i times the fruit\nof worshipping Me. His family is rendered pure and his mother becomes blessed.\nHe whose heart is diluted in the all-pervading Brahma Consciousness, purifies\nthis whole world. There is no doubt in this.\n\n20\\. O Best of Mountains! I have now told everything that you asked about\nBrahma J\xc3\xb1ana. Nothing now remains to be further described.\n\n21\\. This Brahma Vidya (science of the knowledge of Brahma) is to be imparted\nto the eldest son, who is devoted and of good character and to him who is\nendowed with the good qualities as enumerated in the S\'astras and not to be\ngiven to any other person.\n\n22\\. He who is fully devoted to his I _st_ a Deva and who is equally devoted\nto his Guru, to him the high-minded persons should declare the Brahma Vidya.\n\n23\\. Verily, he is God himself, who advises this Brahma Vidya; no one is able\nto repay the debts due to him.\n\n24\\. He who gives birth to a man in Brahma, is, no doubt, superior to the\nordinary father; for the birth that a father gives is destroyed; but the birth\nin Brahma that is given by the Guru is never destroyed.\n\n25\\. So the S\'ruti says :-- Never do harm to the Guru who imparts the\nknowledge of Brahma.\n\n26\\. In all the Siddhantas (decided conclusions) of the S\'astras, it is stated\nthat the Guru who imparts the knowledge of Brahman is the best and the most\nhonourable. If S\'iva, becomes angry, the Guru can save; but when the Guru\nbecomes angry, S\'ankara cannot save. So the Guru should be served with the\nutmost care.\n\n27\\. So the Guru must be served with all the cares that are possible by body,\nmind, and word one should always please Him. Otherwise he becomes ungrateful\nand he is not saved.\n\n28\\. O Best of Mountains! It is very difficult to acquire Brahma J\xc3\xb1ana. Hear a\nstory. A Muni named Dadhyam of Atharvana family went to Indra and prayed to\nhim to give Brahma J\xc3\xb1ana. Indra said: "I would give you Brahma-J\xc3\xb1ana, but if\nyou impart it to any other body, I would sever your head." Dadhyarna agreed to\nthis and Indra gave him the Brahma-J\xc3\xb1ana. After a few days, the two As\'vins\ncame to the Muni and prayed for Brahma Vidya, The Muni said :-- "If I give\n\np. 728\n\nyou the Brahma-Vidyi, Indra, will cut off my head." Hearing this the two\nAs\'vins said :-- "We will cut your head and keep it elsewhere and we will\nattach the head of a horse to your body. Instruct us with the mouth of this\nhorse and when Indra will cut off your this mouth, we will replace your former\nhead." When they said so, the Muni gave them the Brahma-Vidya. Indra cut off\nhis head by his thunderbolt. When the horse-head of the Muni was cut off, the\ntwo physicians of the Devas replaced his original head. This is widely known\nin all the Vedas.\n\nO Chief of Mountains! He becomes blessed who gets this the Brahma-Vidya.\n\nHere ends theThirty-sixth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the Highest Knowledge\nof Brahma in the Mahapura _n_ am, S\'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses,\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 37](bk07ch37.htm)\n\n'
