Whilst to the general reader the\nsection of the Brahma _n_ a treating of this ceremony, and extending over no\nless than five of its fourteen ka _n_ _d_ as--or rather more than one-third of\nthe whole--will probably appear the least inviting part of the work, a special\ninterest attaches to this ceremony, and the dogmatic explanation of its\ndetails, for the student of Indian antiquity. The complicated ritual of the\nFire-altar, as has been pointed out before 1, does not seem to have formed\npart of the original sacrificial system, but was probably developed\nindependently of it, and incorporated with it at a comparatively recent\nperiod. There seems, indeed, some reason to believe that it was elaborated\nwith a definite object in view, viz. that of making the external rites and\nceremonies of the sacrificial cult the practical devotional expression of\ncertain dominant speculative theories of the time. As a matter of fact, the\ndogmatic exposition of no other part of the sacrificial ceremonial reflects so\nfully and so faithfully as that of the Agni _k_ ayana those cosmogonic and\ntheosophic theories which form a characteristic feature of the Brahma _n_ a\nperiod. In the present work, that section commences with a cosmogonic account\nso elaborate as is hardly to be met with anywhere else in the Brahma _n_ a\nliterature; and throughout the course of performance the symbolic import of\nits details is\n\np. xiv\n\nexplained here, as in other Brahma _n_ as, on the lines of those cosmogonic\nspeculations.\n\nWhen, towards the close of the period represented by the Vedic hymns,\ninquiring minds began to look beyond the elemental gods of the traditional\nbelief for some ulterior source of mundane life and existence, the conception\nof a supreme, primordial being, the creator of the universe, became the\nfavourite topic of speculation. We accordingly find different poets of that\nage singing of this uncreate being under different names,--they call him Vi\n_s_ vakarman, the 'All-worker'; or Hira _n_ yagarbha, the 'golden Embryo'; or\nPurusha, the 'Person'; or Ka, the 'Who?; or the heavenly Gandharva Vi _s_\nvavasu, 'All-wealth'; or Pra _g_ apati, the 'Lord of Creatures.' Or they have\nrecourse to a somewhat older figure of the Pantheon, likewise of abstract\nconception, and call him Brahma _n_ aspati 1, the Lord of prayer or devotion;\na figure which would naturally commend itself to the priestly mind, and which,\nindeed, in a later phase of Hindu religion, came to supply not only the name\nof the abstract, impersonal form of the deity, the world-spirit, but also that\nof the first of its three personal forms, the creator of the Hindu triad.\nAmongst these and other names by which the supreme deity is thus designated in\nthe philosophic hymns of the _Ri_ k and Atharva-veda, the name of Pra _g_\napati, the Lord of Creatures or generation, plays a very important part in the\nimmediately succeeding period of literature, viz. that of the Brahma _n_ as.\n\nIn the so-called Purusha-hymn ( _Ri_ g-veda X, 90), in which the supreme\nspirit is conceived of as _th_ e Person or Man (Purusha), born in the\nbeginning, and consisting of 'whatsoever hath been and whatsoever shall be,'\nthe creation of the visible and invisible universe is represented as\noriginating from an 'all-offered' sacrifice 2 (ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a) in which the\nPurusha himself forms the offering-material (havis), or, as one might\n\np. xv\n\nsay, the victim. In this primeval--or rather timeless, because ever proceeding\n--sacrifice, Time itself, in the shape of its unit, the Year, is made to take\nits part, inasmuch as the three seasons, spring, summer, and autumn, of which\nit consists, constitute the ghee, the offering-fuel, and the oblation\nrespectively. These speculations may be said to have formed the foundation on\nwhich the theory of the sacrifice, as propounded in the Brahma _n_ as, has\nbeen reared. Pra _g_ apati, who here takes the place of the Purusha, the\nworld-man, or all-embracing Personality, is offered up anew in every\nsacrifice; and inasmuch as the very dismemberment of the Lord of Creatures,\nwhich took place at that archetypal sacrifice, was in itself the creation of\nthe universe, so every sacrifice is also a repetition of that first creative\nact. Thus the periodical sacrifice is nothing else than a microcosmic\nrepresentation of the ever-proceeding destruction and renewal of all cosmic\nlife and matter. The theologians of the Brahma _n_ as go, however, an\nimportant step further by identifying the performer, or patron, of the\nsacrifice--the Sacrificer--with Pra _g_ apati; and it is this identification\nwhich may perhaps furnish us with a clue to the reason why the authors of the\nBrahma _n_ as came to fix upon 'Pra _g_ apati' as the name of the supreme\nspirit. The name 'Lord of Creatures' is, no doubt, in itself a perfectly\nappropriate one for the author of all creation and generation; but seeing that\nthe peculiar doctrine of the Purusha-sukta imparted such a decisive direction\nto subsequent dogmatic speculation, it might seem rather strange that the name\nthere chosen to designate the supreme being should have been discarded, only\nto be employed occasionally, and then mostly with a somewhat different\napplication 1: On the other hand, the term 'Pra _g_ apati' was manifestly a\n\np. xvi\n\nsingularly convenient one for the identification of the Sacrificer with the\nsupreme 'Lord of Creatures'; for, doubtless, men who could afford to have\ngreat and costly sacrifices, such as those of the _S_ rauta ceremonial,\nperformed for them--if they were not themselves Brahmans, in which case the\nterm might not be inappropriate either--would almost invariably be 'Lords of\nCreatures,' i.e. rulers of men and possessors of cattle, whether they were\nmighty kings, or petty rulers, or landed proprietors, or chiefs of clans. It\nmay be remarked, in this respect, that there is in the language of the Brahma\n_n_ as a constant play on the word 'pra _g_ a' (progenies), which in one place\nmeans creature' in general, whilst in another it has the sense of 'people,\nsubjects,' and in yet another the even more restricted one of 'offspring or\nfamily.'\n\nHow far this identification of the human Sacrificer with the divine Pra _g_\napati goes back, and whether, when first adopted, it was applied at once to\nthe whole of the sacrificial system, or whether it rather originated with a\ncertain restricted group of ritualists in connection with some limited portion\nof the ceremonial such as the Agni _k_ ayana, and became subsequently part and\nparcel of the sacrificial theory, it would probably not be easy to determine.\nAs regards the symbolic connection of the Sacrificer himself with the\nsacrifice, there can at any rate be no doubt that it was an essential and an\nintimate one from the very beginning of the sacrificial practice. When a man\noffers to the gods their favourite food, it is in order to please them and to\ngain some special object of his own,--either to make them strong and inclined\nfor fighting his battles, and to secure their help for some undertaking of his\nor against some danger by which he is threatened; or to deprecate their wrath\nat some offence he knows or fancies he has committed against them; or to thank\nthem for past favours, with an eye, it may be, to new and still greater\nfavours to come. Gradually, however, the connection becomes a subtler and more\nmystic one; the notion of substitution enters into the sacrifice: it is in\nlieu of his own self that man makes the\n\np. xvii\n\noffering. This notion is a familiar one to the theologians of the Brahma _n_\nas, either in the sense that the oblation is sent up to the gods in order to\nprepare the way for the Sacrificer, and secure a place for him in heaven; or\nin the sense that along with the burnt-offering the human body of the\nSacrificer is mystically consumed, and a new, divine body prepared to serve\nhim in the celestial abodes. Intimately connected with this latter notion we\nfind another, introduced rather vaguely, which makes the sacrifice a mystic\nunion in which the Sacrificer generates from out of the Vedi (f.), or altar-\nground, his future, divine self. In this respect Agni, the offering-fire, also\nappears as the mate of Vedi 1; but it will be seen that Agni himself is but\nanother form of the divine and the human Pra _g_ apati.\n\nWith the introduction of the Pra _g_ apati theory into the sacrificial\nmetaphysics, theological speculation takes a higher flight, developing\nfeatures not unlike, in some respects, to those of Gnostic philosophy. From a\nmere act of piety, and of practical, if mystic, significance to the person, or\npersons, immediately concerned, the sacrifice--in the esoteric view of the\nmetaphysician, at least--becomes an event of cosmic significance. By offering\nup his own self in sacrifice, Pra _g_ apati becomes dismembered; and all those\nseparated limbs and faculties of his come to form the universe,--all that\nexists, from the gods and Asuras (the children of Father Pra _g_ apati) down\nto the worm, the blade of grass, and the smallest particle of inert matter. It\nrequires a new, and ever new, sacrifice to build the dismembered Lord of\nCreatures up again, and restore him so as to enable him to offer himself up\nagain and again, and renew the universe, and thus keep up the uninterrupted\nrevolution of time and matter. The idea of the dismembered Pra _g_ apati, and\nof this or that sacrificial act being required to complete and replenish him,\noccurs throughout the lucubrations of the Brahma _n_ as; but in the exposition\nof the ordinary forms of sacrifice, this element can hardly be considered as\n\np. xviii\n\none of vital importance; whilst in the Agni _k_ ayana, on the contrary, it is\nof the very essence of the whole performance. Indeed, it seems to me by no\nmeans unlikely that the Purusha-Pra _g_ apati dogma was first practically\ndeveloped in connection with the ceremony of the Fire-altar 1, and that, along\nwith the admission of the latter into the regular sacrificial ceremonial, it\nwas worked into the sacrificial theory generally. In the Agni _k_ ayana\nsection (Ka _n_ _d_ as VI-X), as has already been stated 2, _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya\nis referred to as the chief authority in doctrinal matters, whilst in the\nremaining portions of the Brahma _n_ a, that place of honour is assigned to Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya. Now, it may be worthy of notice, in connection with this\nquestion of the Pra _g_ apati dogma, that in the list of successive teachers 3\nappended to the Agni _k_ ayana section, the transmission of the sacrificial\nscience--or rather of the science of the Fire-altar, for the list can only\nrefer to that section--is traced from _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya upwards to Tura\nKavasheya, who is stated to have received it from Pra _g_ apati; the Lord of\nCreatures, on his part, having received it from the (impersonal) Brahman. Does\nnot this look almost like a distinct avowal of _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya and his\nspiritual predecessors being answerable for having introduced the doctrine of\nthe identity of Pra _g_ apati and the sacrifice into the sacrificial\nphilosophy? If such he the case, the adaptation of this theory to the dogmatic\nexplanation of the other parts of the ceremonial, as far as the _S_ atapatha-\nBrahma _n_ a is concerned, might be supposed to have been carried out about\nthe time of Sa _m_ _g_ ivi-putra, when the union of the two lines of teachers\nseems to have taken place 4. But seeing that the tenth Ka _n_ _d_ a, called\nthe Mystery, or secret doctrine, of the Fire-altar, was apparently not at\nfirst included in the sacrificial canon of the\n\np. xix\n\n[paragraph continues] Va _g_ asaneyins 1, the mystic speculations in which\nthat section so freely indulges would seem to have been left apart from the\nregular canon, along with other floating material which was not considered\nsuitable for practical purposes, or indispensable for an intelligent\nappreciation of the hidden import of the sacrificial rites.\n\nOnce granted that the real purport of all, sacrificial performances is the\nrestoration of the dismembered Lord of Creatures, and the reconstruction of\nthe All, it cannot be denied that, of all ceremonial observances, the building\nof the great Fire-altar was the one most admirably adapted for this grand\nsymbolic purpose. The very magnitude of the structure;--nay, its practically\nillimitable extent 2, coupled with the immense number of single objects--\nmostly bricks of various kinds--of which it is composed, cannot but offer\nsufficiently favourable conditions for contriving what might fairly pass for a\nminiature representation of at least the visible universe. The very name\n'Agni,' by which the Fire-altar is invariably designated, indicates from the\nvery outset an identification of cardinal importance--that of Pra _g_ apati\nwith Agni, the god of fire, and the sacrifice. It is a natural enough\nidentification; for, as Pra _g_ apati is the arch-sacrificer, so Agni is the\ndivine sacrificer, the priest of the sacrifice. hence the constantly occurring\ntriad--Pra _g_ apati, Agni, and (the human) Sacrificer. The identity of the\naltar and the sacred fire which is ultimately to be placed thereon is\nthroughout insisted upon. Side by side with the forming and baking of the\nbricks for the altar takes place the process of shaping and baking the fire-\npan (ukha). During the year over which the building of the altar is spread,\nthe sacred fire is carried about in the pan by the Sacrificer for a certain\ntime each day. In the same way as the layers of the altar are arranged so as\nto represent earth, air, and heaven, so the fire-pan is fashioned in such a\nway as to be a miniature copy of the three worlds 3. But, while this identity\nis never lost sight of, it is not an absolute\n\np. xx\n\none, but rather one which seems to hold good only for this special sacrificial\nperformance. Though it may be that we have to look upon this identification as\na serious attempt to raise Agni, the divine priest, to the position of a\nsupreme deity, the creator of the universe, such a design seems nowhere to be\nexpressed in clear and unmistakeable terms. Nor are the relations between the\ntwo deities always defined consistently. Pra _g_ apati is _th_ e god above all\nother gods; he is the thirty-fourth god, and includes all the gods (which Agni\ndoes likewise); he is the three worlds as well as the fourth world beyond them\n1. Whilst, thus, he is the universe, Agni is the child of the universe, the\n(cosmic). waters being the womb from which he springs 2. Whence a lotus-leaf\nis placed at the bottom of the fire-altar to represent the waters and the womb\nfrom which Agni-Pra _g_ apati and the human Sacrificer are to be born. Agni is\nboth the father and the son of Pra _g_ apati: 'inasmuch as Pra _g_ apati\ncreated Agni, he is Agni's father; and inasmuch as Agni restored him, Agni is\nhis father 3.' Yet the two are separate; for Pra _g_ apati covets Agni's\nforms,--forms (such as \xc3\x8e _s_ ana, the lord; Mahan Deva _h_ , the great god; Pa\n_s_ upati, the lord of beasts) which are indeed desirable enough for a supreme\nLord of Creatures to possess, and which might well induce Pra _g_ apati to\ntake up Agni within his own self. Though, in accordance with an older\nconception, Agni is still the light or regent of the earth, as Vayu, the wind,\nis that of the air, and the sun that of the heavens; it is now explained that\nreally these are but three forms of the one Agni,--that Agni's splendour in\nheaven is \xc3\x82ditya, that in the air Vayu, and that on earth the (sacrificial)\nfire 4. When Pra _g_ apati is dismembered, Agni takes unto himself the\nescaping fiery spirit of the god; and when he is set up again, Agni becomes\nthe right arm, as Indra becomes the left one, of the Lord of Creatures. Upon\nthe whole, however, the peculiar relations between the two gods may perhaps be\ndefined best in accordance with the\n\np. xxi\n\npassage already referred to:--Agni is created by Pra _g_ apati, and he\nsubsequently restores Pra _g_ apati by giving up his own body (the fire-altar)\nto build up anew the dismembered Lord of Creatures, and by entering into him\nwith his own fiery spirit,--'whence, while being Pra _g_ apati, they yet call\nhim Agni.'\n\nThe shape adopted for the altar is that of some large bird--probably an eagle\nor a falcon--flying towards the east, the gate of heaven. Not that this is the\nform in which Pra _g_ apati is invariably conceived. On the contrary, he is\nfrequently imagined in the form of a man, and symbolic features are often\napplied to him which could only fit, or would best fit, a human body. But,\nbeing the embodiment of all things, Pra _g_ apati naturally possesses all\nforms; whence the shape of a four-footed animal is likewise occasionally\napplied to the altar 1. It was, doubtless, both traditional imagery and\npractical considerations which told in favour of the shape actually chosen.\nPra _g_ apati is the sacrifice and the food of the gods 2; and Soma, the drink\nof immortality and at the same time the Moon, is _the_ divine food or offering\n\xce\xba\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xe1\xbe\xbd \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xbe\xce\xbf\xcf\x87\xce\xae\xce\xbd, the uttama _m_ havis 3, or paramahuti 4, or supreme oblation:\nhence Pra _g_ apati is Soma 5. But Soma was brought down from heaven by the\nbird-shaped Gayatri; and the sacrifice itself is fashioned like a bird 6. In\none passage 7, certain authorities are referred to as making the altar (Agni)\ntake the form of a bird in order to carry the Sacrificer to heaven; but the\nauthor himself there insists dogmatically on the traditional connection of the\naltar with Pra _g_ apati: that it was by assuming that form that the vital\nairs became Pra _g_ apati 8; and that in that\n\np. xxii\n\nform he created the gods who, on their part, became immortal by assuming the\nbirdlike form--and apparently flying up to heaven, which would seem to imply\nthat the Sacrificer himself is to fly up to heaven in form of the bird-shaped\naltar, there to become immortal. It is not, however, only with the Moon,\namongst heavenly luminaries, that Pra _g_ apati is identified, but also with\nthe Sun; for the latter, as we have seen, is but one of the three forms of\nAgni, and the fire on the great altar is itself the Sun 1; whilst the notion\nof the sun being fashioned like a bird flying through space is not an\nunfamiliar one to the poets of the Vedic age. More familiar, however, to the\nauthors of the Brahma _n_ as, as it is more in keeping with the mystic origin\nof Pra _g_ apati, is the identification of the latter, not with the solar orb\nitself, but with the man (purusha) in the sun, the real shedder of light and\nlife. This gold man plays an important part in the speculations of the\nAgnirahasya 2, where he is represented as identical with the man (purusha) in\nthe (right) eye--the individualised Purusha, as it were; whilst his\ncounterpart in the Fire-altar is the solid gold man (purusha) laid down, below\nthe centre of the first layer, on a gold plate, representing the sun, lying\nitself on the lotus-leaf already referred to as the womb whence Agni springs.\nAnd this gold man in the altar, then, is no other than Agni-Pra _g_ apati and\nthe Sacrificer: above him--in the first, third, and fifth layers--lie the\nthree naturally-perforated bricks, representing the three worlds through which\nhe will have to pass on his way to the fourth, invisible, world, the realm of\nimmortal life. We thus meet here again with the hallowed, old name of the Lord\nof Being, only to be made use of for new mystic combinations.\n\nAs the personified totality of all being, Pra _g_ apati, however, not only\nrepresents the phenomena and aspects of space, but also those of time,--he is\nFather Time. But just as, in the material process of building up the Fire-\naltar, the infinite dimensions of space require to be reduced to\n\np. xxiii\n\nfinite proportions, so, in regard to time, the year, as the lowest complete\nrevolution of time, is taken to represent the Lord of Creation:--he is Father\nYear; and accordingly Agni, the Fire-altar, takes a full year to complete.\nAnd, in the same way, Agni, the sacrificial fire, from the time of his being\ngenerated in the fire-pan, as the womb, requires to be carried about by the\nSacrificer for a whole year, to be matured by him before the child Agni can be\nborn and placed on the Fire-altar. The reason why the Sacrificer must do so\nis, of course, that Agni, being the child of the universe--that is of Pra _g_\napati and the Sacrificer,--the latter, at the time when the fire is kindled in\nthe fire-pan, has, as it were, to take Agni within his own self 1, and has\nafterwards to produce him from out of his own self when mature.\n\nBut whilst, in regard to Agni-Pra _g_ apati, the year during which the altar\nis erected represents the infinitude of time, to the mortal Sacrificer it will\nnot be so until he shall have departed this life; and, as a rule, he would\nprobably not be anxious there and then to end his earthly career. Nor is such\nan effort of renunciation demanded of him, but, on the contrary, the\nsacrificial theory holds out to the pious performer of this holy ceremony the\nprospect of his living up to the full extent of the perfect man's life, a\nhundred years; this term of years being thus recognised as another unit of\ntime, so to speak, viz. that of a complete lifetime. Yet, be it sooner or be\nit later, the life of every creature comes to an end; and since time works its\nhavoc on all material existence, and carries off generation after generation,\nthe Supreme Lord of generation, Father Time, as he is the giver of all life,\nso he is likewise that ender of all things--Death. And so the Sacrificer, as\nthe human counterpart of the Lord of Creatures, with the end of his present\nlife, becomes himself Death,--Death ceases to have power over him, and he is\nfor ever removed from the life of material existence, trouble, and illusion,\nto the realms of light and everlasting bliss.\n\np. xxiv\n\nAnd here we get the Supreme Lord in his last aspect; nay, his one true and\nreal aspect, in which the Sacrificer will himself come to share,--that of pure\nintellectuality, pure spirituality;--he is Mind: such is the ultimate source\nof being, the one Self, the Purusha, the Brahman. The author of the Mystery of\nAgni attempts to reveal the process of evolution by which this one true Self,\nthrough sacrifice carried on by means of the Arka-fires of his own innate\nfervour and devotion, comes to manifest himself in the material universe; and\n--as the sum total of the wisdom of _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya--he urges upon the\nsearcher after truth to meditate on that Self, made up of intelligence, and\nendowed with a body of spirit, a form of light, and an etherial nature, . . .\nholding sway over all the regions and pervading this All, being itself\nspeechless and devoid of mental affects;--and bids him believe that 'even as a\ngrain of rice, or the smallest granule of millet, so is the golden Purusha in\nthe heart; even as a smokeless light, it is greater than the sky, greater than\nthe ether, greater than the earth, greater than all existing things; that Self\nof the spirit is my Self: on passing away from hence I shall obtain that Self.\nAid, verily, whosoever has this trust, for him there is no uncertainty.'\n\nAs the practical application of the Agni-Pra _g_ apati mystery to the\nsacrificial ritual consists mainly in the erection of the Fire-altar and the\nceremonies connected with the fire-pan, which fell almost entirely within the\nprovince of the Adhvaryu priest, it is naturally in his text-books, in the Ya\n_g_ ur-veda, that the mystic theory has become fully elaborated. Yet, though\nthe two other classes of priests, the Hot _ri_ s and Udgat _ri_ s 1, take,\nupon the whole, a comparatively subsidiary part in the year's performance\nsymbolising the reconstruction of the Lord of Creatures, they have found\nanother solemn opportunity, subsequently to the completion of the Fire-altar,\nfor making up for any\n\np. xxv\n\nshortcomings in this respect, viz. the Mahavrata, or Great Rite.\n\nThe brick altar, when complete, might apparently be used at once for any kind\nof Soma-sacrifice 1; but whether, if this were to be merely a one-day\nperformance, it might be made a Mahavrata day (in which case it must be an\nAgnish _t_ oma), seems somewhat doubtful 2. As a rule, however, at any rate,\nthe Mahavrata was performed in connection, not with an ekaha or ahina, but\nwith a sacrificial session (sattra); and since sacrificial sessions, it would\nseem, could only be undertaken by Brahmans who would at the same time be the\nSacrificers--or rather G _ri_ hapatis (masters of the house or householders)\nas the Sattrins are called--and their own officiating priests, the Mahavrata\nwould thus generally, if not invariably, be reserved for Brahmans 3. Indeed,\nin our Brahma _n_ a (IX, 5, 2, 12-13) the rule is laid down that no one may\nofficiate for another person at the Agni _k_ ayana, the Mahavrata (saman), and\nthe Mahad Uktham; and dire consequences are predicted in the case of any one\nwho does so; 'for, indeed, these (rites) are his divine, immortal body; and he\nwho performs them for another person, makes over to another his divine body,\nand a withered trunk is all that remains.' And, though other authorities are\nthen referred to who merely prescribe, as a penance for those who have\nofficiated at these ceremonies for others, that they should either perform\nthem for themselves or cause others to perform them again, the author\n\np. xxvi\n\nadheres to his opinion that there is no atonement for such an offence. There\ncan be no doubt, however, that the Agni _k_ ayana, at any rate, was not\nrestricted to the Brahma _n_ ical order 1; and this passage, if it does not\nmerely record a former sacrificial practice, has probably to be understood in\nthe sense that one must not officiate for another at an. Agni _k_ ayana which\nis to be followed by a Soma-sacrifice with the Mahavrata. If the Sattra\nperformed was one of the shortest kind, viz. a Dvada _s_ aha, or twelve days'\nperformance--consisting of a Da _s_ aratra, preceded and followed by an\nAtiratra--the Mahavrata was inserted, it would seem, between the Da _s_ aratra\nand the final Atiratra. Usually, however, the Sattra, like the Agni _k_ ayana,\nlasted a full year; the favourite form being the 'Gavam ayanam,' arranged, in\naccordance with the progress of the sun, in two halves, an ascending and a\ndescending one, divided by a central day, the Vishuvat. The Mahavrata was\nperformed on the last day but one of the year, the day before the final\nAtiratra, being itself preceded (as it was in the case of the Dvada _s_ aha)\nby a Da _s_ aratra, or ten days' performance. Now, the chief feature of the\nMahavrata day is the chanting,--in connection with a special cup of Soma-\njuice, the Mahavratiya-graha--of the Mahavrata-saman 2, as the Hot _ri_ 's P\n_ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra at the midday service; this chant being followed by the\nrecitation of the Mahad Uktham 3, or Great Litany, by the Hot _ri_. The\nspecial feature, however, of these two ceremonies, which recalls the mystic\nAgni-Pra _g_ apati doctrine, is the supposed birdlike form of both the chant\nand the litany. The Lord of Creatures, as the embodiment of all things, also\nrepresents the 'trayi vidya,' or sacred threefold science, the Veda.\nAccordingly, the Stomas (hymn-forms) of the single Samans (chanted\n\np. xxvii\n\nverses) composing the Stotra or hymn of praise (the Mahavrata-saman), on the\none hand, and the verses and metres of the recited litany, on the other, are\nso arranged and explained as to make up the different parts of a bird's body.\nIt need scarcely be remarked that, whilst in the case of the altar the task of\nbringing out at least a rough resemblance to a flying bird offered no great\ndifficulties, it is altogether beyond the capabilities of vocal performances\nsuch as the chant and the recitation of hymns and detached verses. But the\nvery fact that this symbolism is only a matter of definition and make-believe\nmakes it all the more characteristic of the great hold which the Pra _g_ apati\ntheory had gained upon the sacerdotal mind.\n\nThe question as to whether these compositions themselves might seem to show\nany signs of comparatively recent introduction of this symbolism requires\nfurther investigation before it can be answered. Of the Mahavrata-saman we\nhave virtually a single version, with only indications of certain\nsubstitutions which may be made in the choice of texts and tunes; the parts of\nthe bird's body represented by the single Samans being in the order--head,\nright wing, left wing, tail, and trunk. Of the Mahad Uktham, on the other\nhand, we possess two different versions, those of the Aitareya and the _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana schools of _Ri_ g-veda theologians. Both of them start with the\nhymns representing the trunk of the bird; but otherwise there is so marked a\ndifference between them, both as to arrangement and the choice of verses and\nhymns, that it seems pretty clear that, whilst there must have existed already\na certain traditional form of the litany when these two schools separated, it\nwas not yet of a sufficiently settled character to prevent such serious\ndiscrepancies to arise as those exhibited by the two rituals. This point\nbeing, however, of too technical a nature to be entered upon in this place,\nits further investigation must be reserved for some other opportunity.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xiii:1](sbe4302.htm#fr_0) See part i, introduction, p. xxxi.\n\n[xiv:1](sbe4302.htm#fr_1) Cf. _Ri_ g-veda X, 22, 2.\n\n[xiv:2](sbe4302.htm#fr_2) That is to say, a sacrifice at which not only\nportions of the sacrificial dish, or the victim, are offered up to the\ndeities, but where every single part of it is offered.\n\n[xv:1](sbe4302.htm#fr_3) In its original sense it occurs at the beginning of\nthe Agni _k_ ayana section, VI, 1, 1, 2-3, in connection with what might\nalmost be regarded as an exposition of the Purusha-sukta. The seven original\npurushas out of which _the_ Purusha comes to be compacted, are apparently\nintended to account for the existence of the seven _Ri_ shis (explained in the\nBrahma _n_ as as representing the vital airs) prior to the creation of the one\nPurusha. It would seem that they themselves previously composed the as yet\nuncorporeal Purusha.\n\n[xvii:1](sbe4302.htm#fr_4) See I, 2, 3, 15-16.

Though nothing is said there of their having themselves been shaped\nlike birds, this might perhaps be inferred from the use of the term 'purusha'\nwith reference to them. In the Purusha-sukta nothing whatever is said of a\nbirdlike form, either in regard to the _Ri_ shis, p. xxii or the Purusha; the\nlatter being on the contrary, imagined in the form of a gigantic man.\n\n[xxii:1](sbe4302.htm#fr_24) VI, 1, 2, 20; 3, 1, 55.\n\n[xxii:2](sbe4302.htm#fr_25) [X, 5, 2, 1](sbe4367.htm#10:5:2:1) seqq.\n\n[xxiii:1](sbe4302.htm#fr_26) VII, 4, 1,1.\n\n[xxiv:1](sbe4302.htm#fr_27) They take part, however, in such ceremonies as the\ndoing homage to the completed Fire-altar by means of the Parimads; cf.

These, however, were doubtless by no means the only\nalternatives.\n\n[xxv:2](sbe4302.htm#fr_29) See, however, Saya _n_ a on Ait. \xc3\x82r. V, 1, s, 1,\nwhere it is distinctly stated that the Mahavrata may either be performed as an\nEkaha, or as part of either an Ahina, or a Sattra.--Katyayana, XVI, s, 2, lays\ndown the rule that (though the building of an altar is not a necessary\ncondition for the performance of a Soma-sacrifice) it is indispensable in the\ncase of a Soma-sacrifice performed. with the Mahavrata.\n\n[xxv:3](sbe4302.htm#fr_30) That is to say, as Sacrificers. Persons of other\ncastes of course took part in the proceedings of this day. In the various\naccounts of these proceedings, no alternative ceremonies seem anywhere\nreferred to in case the Sacrificers themselves belong to different castes.\n\n[xxvi:1](sbe4302.htm#fr_31) See, for instance, Sat. Br. VI, 6, 3, 12-15, where\ndirections are given as to certain alternatives of performance at the\ninitiation ceremony in case the Sacrificer is either a Kshatriya, or a\nPurohita, or any other person. The ceremonies connected with the consecration\nof the Sacrificer ([IX, 3, 4, 1](sbe4338.htm#9:3:4:1) seqq.) point chiefly to\na king.\n\n[xxvi:2](sbe4302.htm#fr_32) See [p. 282](sbe4345.htm#page_282), note\n[5](sbe4345.htm#fn_525) of the present volume.\n\n[xxvi:3](sbe4302.htm#fr_33) See notes to pp.\n[110](sbe4324.htm#page_110)-[113](sbe4324.htm#page_113) of this volume.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 1, 1.
