Having then stridden the Vish _n_ u strides, and reverentially\nstood by (the fire) with the Vatsapra 1 (hymn), after the sun has set, he in\nthe first place throws out the ashes (from the fire-pan). For at that (former)\ntime he regales him (Agni) with that food, those kindling-sticks; and the foul\npart of that eaten food sinks to the bottom as ashes. He now clears him\nthereof, and infuses speech into him 2, thus freed from foulness. Having\ninfused speech, he puts on a kindling-stick,--and thereby regales him with\nfood for the night,--with, 'Night for night bearing unremittingly 3'--the\nmeaning of this has been told: he prays for that same security and wellbeing\nfor the night; and whatsoever he puts on 'thereafter by night, that he puts on\nas a libation offered to him 4.\n\n6:6:4:22\\. And in the morning, when the sun has risen, he in the first place\nthrows out the ashes. For at that (former) time he regales him with that food,\nthat kindling-stick; and the foul part of that eaten food which he puts on\nduring the night sinks to the\n\np. 262\n\nbottom as ashes. He now clears him thereof, and infuses speech into him thus\nfreed from foulness. Having infused speech, he puts on a kindling-stick,--and\nthereby regales him with food for the day--with, 'Day by day bearing\nunremittingly;'--the meaning of this has been told: he prays for that same\nsecurity and well-being for the day; and whatsoever he puts on thereafter by\nday, that he puts on as a libation offered to him.\n\n6:6:4:33\\. Verily, day and night passing on come up to a year, and the year is\neverything here: he prays for that security and well-being for a succession of\ndays.\n\n6:6:4:44\\. And when they give him (the Sacrificer) the fast-milk, he puts on a\nkindling-stick, after dipping it into the fast-milk. Some, however, say, 'Let\nhim not dip it into the fast-milk: he would be offering a libation, and it\nwould be improper were one who is initiated to offer a libation.'\n\n6:6:4:55\\. Let him nevertheless dip it in, for that (\xc3\x82havaniya fire) is his\n(the Sacrificer's) divine body, and this (real body of his) is his human one.\nNow were he not to dip it in, he would not be satisfying that divine body of\nhis; but when he clips it in, he does so satisfy that divine body. And in that\nit is a kindling-stick, it is not a libation; and in that it is dipped into\nthe fast-milk, it is food, for the fast-milk is food.\n\n6:6:4:66\\. And having put on the kindling-stick, he drinks the fast-milk; for\nthat (fire) is his divine body, and this (body of his) is the human one; and\nthe gods (come) first, and then men: hence he drinks the fast-milk after\nputting the kindling-stick on (the fire).\n\n6:6:4:77\\. [He puts it on, with Va _g_. S. XI, 83] 'O\n\np. 263\n\n[paragraph continues] Lord of food; give us of thy food!'--that is, 'O Lord of\nviands, give us of thy viands!'--'of the pain-allaying, strengthening'--that\nis, 'of the hunger-allaying, strengthening (food),'--'Onward, onward lead thou\nthe giver!'--the giver, doubtless, is the Sacrificer: thus, 'Onward lead thou\nthe Sacrificer!'--'Give us sustenance for the two-footed and the four-footed!'\n--he thereby asks a blessing. Now as to the expiation in case of (the fire-pan\nbeing) broken which, he said, would be explained 'in a subsequent chapter 1.'\n\n6:6:4:88\\. If the fire-pan were to break, let him pour that (fire in the pan)\ninto any such unbroken, new pot with a wide mouth as there may be; for the pan\nwhich is broken indeed suffers injury, but uninjured is this deity (Agni):\n'Uninjured I will bear him in the uninjured!' so he thinks. Into that (pot) he\nfirst throws a potsherd of the (broken) pan, and thus he (Agni) is not\ndeprived of that womb of his.\n\n6:6:4:99\\. He then takes the (remaining 2) clay, and having pounded both the\n(broken) pan and that remainder, and mixed it, he makes a (new) pan in the\nvery same way, without using any formula, quite silently. Having baked it, he\npours (the fire) over. The expiation in this case is one of performance only.\nHaving again thrown that potsherd into the (new) pan, and pounded both the\n(temporary) pan and the remaining clay, and mixed it, he lays it aside for\nexpiation.\n\n6:6:4:1010\\. And if the fire in the pan (Ukhya Agni) were to go out, it is\ndoubtless to the Garhapatya that it goes, for from the Garhapatya it has been\ntaken. Having then taken it out of the Garhapatya eastwards (to the place of\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya), and put fuel on it, let him\n\np. 264\n\nput the fire-pan on it in the same way (as before), without using any formula,\nquite silently. When the fire rises up to it,--\n\n6:6:4:1111\\. He performs two expiations. For it is for (the obtainment of) all\nhis wishes that he makes up that (fire); and whatever part of his wishes is\nhere cut off when the fire goes out, that he thereby joins together and heals.\nHe performs both expiations, that of the (Soma) sacrifice and that of the\nfire-altar,--first that of the sacrifice, then that of the fire-altar: the\nsignificance of this has been explained 1.\n\n6:6:4:1212\\. Having cut out with a kindling-stick some of the butter, he\noffers sitting a libation, with (Vag;. S. XII, 4,), 'To Vi _s_ vakarman,\nhail!' Then stepping near he puts the kindling-stick on the fire, with (Va\n_g_. S. XII, 44), 'Again the \xc3\x82dityas, the Rudras, the Vasus may kindle thee,\nagain the Brahmans with sacrifices, O bringer of good things!'--that is, 'May\nthose deities again kindle thee!'--'With ghee make thou grow thy body, let the\nwishes of the Sacrificer be true!'--that is, 'With ghee indeed make thou grow\nthy body, and for whatever wishes the Sacrificer makes up a fire, may they all\ncome true!'\n\n6:6:4:1313\\. And if the Garhapatya fire were to go out, it is doubtless to the\nchurning-sticks that it goes, for from the churning-sticks it has been taken.\nHaving churned it out with the churning-sticks, and put fuel on it, he\nperforms two expiations.\n\n6:6:4:1414\\. And if the \xc3\x82havaniya fire were to go out whilst the pressing (of\nSoma) proceeds, it is doubtless to the Garhapatya that it goes, for from the\nGarhapatya it has been taken. Having taken it straightway\n\np. 265\n\neastward from the Garhapatya, and put fuel on it, he performs two expiations:\nwhatever (kind of Soma) sacrifice may be (performed) at the time, the\nexpiation of that sacrifice he should perform; and of like kind is the\nexpiation of the fire-altar.\n\n6:6:4:1515\\. And if the \xc3\x82gnidhriya fire were to go out, it is doubtless to the\nGarhapatya that it goes, for from the Garhapatya it has been taken. Having\ntaken it from the Garhapatya eastward along the north of the Sadas, and put\nfuel on it, he performs two expiations. And if the Garhapatya were to go out,\nthe meaning (procedure) of that has been explained.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[261:1](sbe4148.htm#fr_498) See [VI, 7, 4, 1](sbe4152.htm#6:7:4:1) seq.\n\n[261:2](sbe4148.htm#fr_499) Or, sets free the speech in him.\n\n[261:3](sbe4148.htm#fr_500) See above, [VI, 6, 3, 8](sbe4147.htm#6:6:3:8).\n\n[261:4](sbe4148.htm#fr_501) Lit.
