On account of the impossibility (of contradictory attributes) in one\nthing, (the _G_ aina doctrine is) not (to be accepted).\n\nHaving disposed of the Bauddha doctrine we now turn to the system of the\nGymnosophists ( _G_ ainas).\n\nThe _G_ ainas acknowledge seven categories (tattvas), viz. soul ( _g_ iva),\nnon-soul (a _g_ iva), the issuing outward (asrava), restraint (sa _m_ vara),\ndestruction (nir _g_ ara), bondage (bandha), and release (moksha) 1. Shortly\nit may be said that they acknowledge two categories, viz. soul and non-soul,\nsince the five other categories may be subsumed under these two.--They also\nset forth a set of categories different from the two mentioned. They teach\nthat there are five so-called\n\np. 429\n\nastikayas ('existing bodies,' i.e. categories), viz. the categories of soul (\n_g_ iva), body (pudgala), merit (dharma), demerit (adharma), and space (aka\n_s_ a). All these categories they again subdivide in various fanciful ways 1.\n--To all things they apply the following method of reasoning, which they call\nthe saptabha _n_ ginaya: somehow it is; somehow it is not; somehow it is and\nis not; somehow it is indescribable; somehow it is and is indescribable;\nsomehow it is not and is indescribable; somehow it is and is not and is\nindescribable.\n\nTo this unsettling style of reasoning they submit even such conceptions as\nthat of unity and eternity 2.\n\nThis doctrine we meet as follows.--Your reasoning, we say, is inadmissible 'on\naccount of the impossibility in one thing.' That is to say, it is impossible\nthat contradictory attributes such as being and non-being should at the same\ntime belong to one and the same thing; just as observation teaches us that a\nthing cannot be hot and cold at the same moment. The seven categories asserted\nby you must either be so many and such or not be so many and such; the third\nalternative expressed in the words 'they either are such or not such' results\nin a cognition of indefinite nature which is no more a source of true\nknowledge than doubt is. If you should plead that the cognition that a thing\nis of more than one nature is definite and therefore a source of true\nknowledge, we deny this. For the unlimited assertion that all things are of a\nnon-exclusive nature is itself something, falls as such under the alternative\npredications 'somehow it is,' 'somehow it is not,' and so ceases to be a\ndefinite assertion. The same happens to the person making the assertion and to\nthe result of the assertion; partly they are, partly they are not. As thus the\nmeans of knowledge, the object of knowledge, the knowing subject, and the act\nof knowledge are all alike indefinite, how can the Tirthakara ( _G_ ina) teach\nwith any claim to authority, and how can his followers act on a doctrine the\nmatter of which is altogether\n\np. 430\n\nindeterminate? Observation shows that only when a course of action is known to\nhave a definite result people set about it without hesitation. Hence a man who\nproclaims a doctrine of altogether indefinite contents does not deserve to be\nlistened to any more than a drunken man or a madman.--Again, if we apply the\n_G_ aina reasoning to their doctrine of the five categories, we have to say\nthat on one view of the matter they are five and on another view they are not\nfive; from which latter point of view it follows that they are either fewer or\nmore than five. Nor is it logical to declare the categories to be\nindescribable. For if they are so, they cannot be described; but, as a matter\nof fact, they are described so that to call them indescribable involves a\ncontradiction. And if you go on to say that the categories on being described\nare ascertained to be such and such, and at the same time are not ascertained\nto be such and such, and that the result of their being ascertained is perfect\nknowledge or is not perfect knowledge, and that imperfect knowledge is the\nopposite of perfect knowledge or is not the opposite; you certainly talk more\nlike a drunken or insane man than like a sober, trustworthy person.--If you\nfurther maintain that the heavenly world and final release exist or do not\nexist and are eternal or non-eternal, the absence of all determinate knowledge\nwhich is implied in such statements will result in nobody's acting for the\npurpose of gaining the heavenly world and final release. And, moreover, it\nfollows from your doctrine that soul, non-soul, and so on, whose nature you\nclaim to have ascertained, and which you describe as having existed from all\neternity, relapse all at once into the condition of absolute indetermination.\n--As therefore the two contradictory attributes of being and non-being cannot\nbelong to any of the categories--being excluding non-being and vice versa non-\nbeing excluding being--the doctrine of the Arhat must be rejected.--The above\nremarks dispose likewise of the assertions made by the _G_ ainas as to the\nimpossibility of deciding whether of one thing there is to be predicated\noneness or plurality, permanency or non-permanency, separateness or non-\nseparateness, and so on.--The _G_ aina doctrine that\n\np. 431\n\naggregates are formed from the atoms--by them called pudgalas--we do not\nundertake to refute separately as its refutation is already comprised in that\nof the atomistic doctrine given in a previous part of this work.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[428:1](sbe34209.htm#fr_416) Soul and non-soul are the enjoying souls and the\nobjects of their enjoyment; asrava is the forward movement of the senses\ntowards their objects; sa _m_ vara is the restraint of the activity of the\nsenses; nir _g_ ara is self-mortification by which sin is destroyed; the works\nconstitute bondage; and release is the ascending of the soul, after bondage\nhas ceased, to the highest regions.--For the details, see Professor Cowell's\ntranslation of the \xc3\x82rhata chapter of the Sarvadar _s_ a _n_ asa _m_ graha.\n\n[429:1](sbe34209.htm#fr_417) Cp. translation of Sarvadar _s_ a _n_ asa _m_\ngraha, p. 59.\n\n[429:2](sbe34209.htm#fr_418) And so impugn the doctrine of the one eternal\nBrahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 34](sbe34210.htm)\n\n"
