To render\nthis meaning still more specific, the Sanskrit term "Karma," derived from the\nroot verb "Kri," to act, is added. Taken in its literal sense, therefore,\nKarma signifies action, and refers to all actions whether of mind or body.\nWherever there is activity of any kind, it is Karma. In this sense devotion,\nlove, worship, meditation, concentration, discrimination are all Karma; as are\nalso, for the same reason, eating, drinking, walking, talking, or performing\nany organic function.\n\nAgain, every action, as we are aware, is followed by reaction. No action can\nbe separated from its result, as no cause can be absolutely disconnected from\nits effect.\n\np. 83\n\n[paragraph continues] Consequently the secondary meaning of Karma embraces all\nreactions or results of actions. The chain of cause and sequence, known as the\n"law of causation," is also called Karma; and every action of body and mind is\ngoverned by the law of Karma or of action and reaction. Being subject to this\nnatural law, we have been working in this world from the beginningless past,\nand reaping the results of our efforts, whether pleasant or unpleasant, good\nor evil.\n\nWhen, furthermore, we consider that the effect of each action leaves its\nimpression on the mind-substance, which impression becomes the seed of a fresh\naction of a similar nature, we understand the third meaning of the term. In\nthis sense the word Karma includes the accumulated results of past actions or\nrather the seed forms of future activities.\n\np. 84\n\nHence the character of an individual, which is the aggregate result of the\nworks of his previous life may be called Karma. In the same way, the future\nlife will be the sum-total of the results of the mental and physical actions\nof the present life.\n\nKarma Yoga is, therefore, that branch of the Science of Yoga which discusses\nthe three ideas conveyed by the word "Karma," explains the philosophy of work,\ndescribes the method by which the individual soul can extricate itself from\nthe wheel of action and reaction, and having escaped from the irresistible law\nof causation by which every one is bound, can attain to perfect freedom,\nfulfill the highest purpose of life, and thus through right action alone reach\nthe ultimate goal of all religion. It is the path best fitted for those who\nbelieve in no creed, who are not devotional, and who do\n\np. 85\n\nnot care to worship or pray to a personal God.\n\nKarma Yoga teaches that the cause of the suffering, misery, disease, and\nmisfortune, which overshadow our earthly life, lies in our own actions. We\nreap the fruit of that which we ourselves have sown. These causes are within\nus. We should blame neither our parents nor any evil spirit for our\nsufferings, but should look within ourselves to discover the source thereof.\nThis branch of Yoga likewise describes the secret of work, by knowing which we\ncan remove all causes of bondage and suffering, and enjoy freedom, peace, and\nhappiness both here and after death. It tells us that every action inspired by\nthe motive of desire for results attaches the soul to these results, and\nconsequently becomes a source of bondage. The secret of work consists in\nworking for work\'s sake and not\n\np. 86\n\nfor fruits. If this principle be applied to the actions of our daily lives,\nthen every work done by us will help us to advance toward the perfect\nemancipation of the soul. Whoever performs his duties understanding the secret\nof work, becomes truly unselfish and eventually gains knowledge of his real\nSelf, which is immortal and divine.\n\nAccording to Karma Yoga, the true Self when it becomes identified with the\nlimitations of the mind and the physical form, appears as "ego," "doer," or\n"actor," and performing work from various motives, remains attached to its\nresults. We thus feel as one with our body and endeavor to enrich the narrow,\nlimited self or "I" by getting something from that which is "not I." This\nimperfect knowledge of the "Self," or rather this ignorance of the true\n"Self," is the cause of selfishness.\n\np. 87\n\nFrom selfishness in turn proceeds all that desire for results which forces us\nto live and act like slaves. Karma Yoga shows us the way by which we can\nbecome conscious of our true Self, and, by widening the range of the limited\n"ego," can make it universal. When we have accomplished this, we shall live in\nthe world working not from selfish motives, but for humanity, yet with as much\ninterest in heart as we had when we worked for ourselves. Nor shall we then\nseek the comfort and pleasure of this little personality which is now the\nchief center of our interest and effort, but shall strive for the good of all.\n\nAnyone who wishes to become a true Karma Yogi should clearly understand the\nphilosophy of work, 1 and should remember that every action of body and mind\nmust produce some effect which will eventually\n\np. 88\n\ncome back upon the doer; and that, if there be the smallest desire for result,\nit will be the seed of future action of a like nature. He should also realize\nthat every action produces similar reaction. If the action be in harmony with\nthe moral and physical laws which govern our lives, then the reaction which\ncomes back upon the actor will bring only that which is good,--peace, rest,\nfortune, health, and happiness. If, on the contrary, these laws are violated,\nthen the result will be evil, producing restlessness, discomfort, loss of\nfortune, disease, and unhappiness.\n\nA traveller in the path of Karma Yoga should not even think evil of another,\nbecause in the attempt to injure others we first injure ourselves. Every\nthought puts the mind-substance in a certain state of vibration and opens the\ndoor to the influence of such minds as are in the same state\n\np. 89\n\nof vibration. Therefore when we cherish evil thoughts, we run the double risk\nof affecting other minds and of being influenced by all evil-minded persons\nholding similar thoughts, nay, we expose our minds to all the evil thoughts\nthat have been thought in the past and stored up in the mental atmosphere of\nthe world. A corresponding result comes from the holding of good thoughts.\nThis is the reason why evil-doers grow worse and worse every day, and the\ndoers of good deeds become better and better.\n\nA Karma Yogi should realize that there is one Being, or one Spirit, in the\nuniverse. Seeing this same Being or Spirit in all living creatures, he should\nrecognize the rights of all and should not injure anyone either mentally or\nphysically. Such a Yogi is truly unselfish; he is a blessing to the world and\nto humanity.\n\np. 90\n\nHe who wishes to practice Karma Yoga should abandon attachment to the fruit of\nhis labors, and learn to work for work\'s sake, keeping in mind the idea that\nby his work he is paying off the debt which he owes to parents, to society, to\ncountry, and to all mankind. Like a wet nurse he should take care of his\nchildren, realizing that they do not belong to him, but that they are placed\nin his charge in order that he and they may gain experience and unfold their\nlatent powers and feelings.\n\nA true Karma Yogi, furthermore, is he who recognizes that his real Self is not\na doer of action, but that all mental and physical activity is merely the\nresult of the forces of nature. Therefore he never claims that any work,\nwhether good or bad, has been done by his true "Self." He lets his mind,\nintellect, and sense-organs work incessantly, while in his soul he holds\nsteadfastly\n\np. 91\n\nto the idea that he is the witness-like Knower of all activity, mental or\nphysical. In this way he frees himself from the law of Karma and escapes from\nall the results of work which bind ordinary workers. Neither does he count\nsuccess or failure in his daily life. He does his best in each effort put\nforth by him, and after performing his duty to the utmost of his ability, if\nhe meets with failure he does not grieve, but, saying within himself that he\ndid all that he could under the circumstances, he maintains his calmness and\nenjoys peace of mind even in the face of defeat.\n\nThe aim of a Karma Yogi is to live in the world and act like a master, not\nlike a slave. Ordinary mortals implicitly obey the masters of desire and\npassion, following them without question or discrimination. But he who chooses\nthe path of Karma Yoga seeks absolute control over\n\np. 92\n\ndesire and passion and directs the force manifesting through these channels\ntoward the highest ideal of life--freedom of the soul.\n\nIn fulfilling all the duties of life the Karma Yogi takes refuge in love,\nmaking it the sole motive power behind every action of body and mind; and\nwhenever he performs any duty, it is always through love. He understands that\nsense of duty is bondage, while work done through a feeling of love frees the\nsoul and brings peace, rest, and, in the end, everlasting happiness.\n\nAll the great spiritual leaders of mankind, like Christ and Buddha, were Karma\nYogis. They worked for humanity through love, and showed by their example how\nperfect freedom can be attained by right work. Buddha did not preach the\nworship of a personal God, but he established\n\np. 93\n\nthe truth that those who do not believe in a personal God and who are not\ndevotional, can reach the highest goal of all religions by the path of Karma\nYoga.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[87:1](hby07.htm#fr_4) See "Philosophy of Work," by the same author.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Bhakti Yoga](hby08.htm)\n\n'
