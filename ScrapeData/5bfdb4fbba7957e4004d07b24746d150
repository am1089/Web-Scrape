Of that (milk-rice) let him sacrifice, the first oblation with (the\nverse), 'To us, O Mitra and Varu _n_ a' (Sama-veda I, 220), the second with\n(the verse), 'Not in our offspring' ( _Ri_ g-veda I, 114, 8),\n\n3. 3 And (eight \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations) with the 'cow's names' (i.e. with the formulas), 'The lovely one art thou,' &c., with each (name) separately.\n\n4. 4 The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthalipaka rite.\n\n5\\. Having carried the P _ri_ shataka around the fire, turning his right side\ntowards (the fire), and having caused the Brahma _n_ as to look at it (i.e. at\nthe P _ri_ shataka), he should look at it himself with (the verse\n\np. 93\n\nrepeated by the Brahma _n_ as and by the-sacrificer), 'That bright eye,\ncreated by the gods, which rises on the east\xc2\x97may we see it a hundred autumns;\nmay we live a hundred autumns!'\n\n6\\. After he has entertained the Brahma _n_ as with food and has eaten\nhimself, (the sacrificer and his family) should tie (to their arms, necks,\n&c.) amulets made of lac together with all sorts of herbs, for the sake of\nprosperity.\n\n7\\. In the evening he should feed the cows with the P _ri_ shataka, and should\nlet the calves join them.\n\n8\\. Thus (the cows) will thrive.\n\n9. 9 At the sacrifice of the first fruits a mess of boiled rice-grains with milk, sacred to Indra and Agni, (is prepared).\n\n10\\. Having sacrificed first a Havis offering of that (milk-rice), he\nsacrifices over that (oblation) four \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations with (the verses), 'To\nhim who bears a hundred weapons,' &c. (MB. II, 1, 9-12).\n\n11. 11 The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthalipaka rite.\n\n12\\. The rest of the remnants of the sacrificial food he should give to eat to\nall (persons present) who have received the initiation (Upanayana).\n\n13\\. Having 'spread under' water once, he should cut off two portions of the\nboiled rice-grains.\n\n14\\. Three (portions are cut off) by descendants of Bh _ri_ gu.\n\n15\\. And over (these portions) water (is poured).\n\n16. 16 (After the food has been prepared in this\n\np. 94\n\nway), he should swallow it without chewing it, with (the Mantra), 'From the\ngood to the better' (ibid. 13).\n\n17\\. In the same way three times.\n\n18\\. Silently a fourth time.\n\n19\\. After he has cut off a greater portion,\n\n20\\. They may, if they like, chew that.\n\n21\\. Having sipped water, they should touch their mouths, their heads, and\ntheir limbs from above downwards, with (the verse), 'This art thou' (ibid.\n14).\n\n22\\. In the same way (sacrifices of the first fruits are performed) of _S_\nyamaka (panicum frumentaceum) and of barley.\n\n23\\. (At the sacrifice) of _S_ yamaka (the Mantra with which the food is\npartaken of [comp. Sutra 16], is), 'May Agni eat as the first' (ibid. 15).\n\n24\\. (At the sacrifice) of barley, 'This barley, mixed with honey' (ibid. 16).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[92:1](sbe30030.htm#fr_325) 8, 1 seq.
