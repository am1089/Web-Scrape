But Works accumulated and Works to come both\nmelt away in the fire of perfect wisdom.\n\nWhen they have beheld the oneness of the Self and the Eternal, and stand ever\nfirm in the power of that knowledge, for them those three kinds of Works exist\nno longer; for them there is only the Eternal, free from every change.\n\np. 72\n\nWhen the saint rests in the Self, through understanding that the Self is other\nthan its vestures, that the Self is the pure Eternal; then the myth of the\nreality of Works entered on no longer holds him, just as the myth of union\nwith things of dream no longer holds him who has awakened.\n\nFor he who is awake no longer keeps the sense of "I and mine and that," for\nhis looking-glass body and the world that belongs to it; but comes to himself\nmerely through waking.\n\nNeither a desire for pursuing mythical objects, nor any grasping after even a\nworld full of them, is seen in him who has awakened. But if the pursuit of\nmirages goes on, then it is seen for certain that the man has not wakened from\nsleep.\n\nThus dwelling in the supreme Eternal, through the real Self, he stands and\nbeholds naught else. Like the memory of an object looked on in dream, so is\nit, for the wise, with eating or the other acts of life.\n\nThe body is built up through Works; the Works entered upon make for the\nbuilding up of various forms; but the Self is not built up through works.\n\n"Unborn, eternal, immemorial," says the Scripture, whose words are not in\nvain; of him who rests in that Self, what building up of Works entered on can\nthere be?\n\nWorks entered upon flourish then, when the Self is identified with the body;\nbut the identifying of Self with body brings no joy, therefore let Works\nentered upon be renounced. [460]\n\nEven the building up of a body through Works entered\n\np. 73\n\non is a mirage; whence can come the reality of a mere reflected image? whence\ncan come the birth of an unreality?\n\nWhence can come the death of what has not even been born? Whence can come the\nentering on of what does not even exist?--if there be a melting away of the\neffects of unwisdom, root and all, through the power of wisdom.\n\nHow does this body stand? In the case of him who takes inert things to be\nreal, Works entered on are supported by the sight of outward things--thus says\nthe scripture; yet it does not teach the reality of the body and the like, to\nthe wise.\n\nOne, verily, is the Eternal, without a second. There is no difference at all.\nAltogether perfect, without beginning or end, measureless and without change.\n\nThe home of Being, the home of Consciousness, the home of Bliss enduring,\nchangeless; one, verily, without a second, is the Eternal. There is no\ndifference at all.\n\nFull of the pure essence of the unmanifested, endless, at the crown of all;\none, verily, without a second, is the Eternal; there is no difference at all.\n\nThat can neither be put away, nor sought after; that can neither be taken nor\napproached--one, verily, without a second, is the Eternal; there is no\ndifference at all.\n\nWithout qualities, without parts, subtle, without wavering, without stain;\none, verily, without a second, is the Eternal; there is no difference at all.\n[468]\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Master and Pupil](cjw12.htm)\n\n'
