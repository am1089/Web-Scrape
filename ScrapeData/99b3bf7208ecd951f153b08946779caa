XVII.\n\nOf heretics, or those who reject the authority of the Vedas: their origin, as\ndescribed by Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha to Bhishma: the gods, defeated by the Daityas, praise\nVishn\xcc\x81u: an illusory being, or Buddha, produced from his body.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Thus, in former days, spake the holy Aurva to the illustrious\nmonarch Sagara, when he inquired concerning the usages proper to be practised\nby mankind; and thus I have explained to you the whole of those observances\nagainst which no one ought to transgress.\n\nMAITREYA.--You have told me, venerable sir, that an ancestral rite is not to\nbe looked upon by certain persons, amongst whom you mentioned such as were\napostates. I am desirous to learn whom you intended by that appellation; what\npractices bestow such a title upon a man; and what is the character of the\nindividual to whom you alluded.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--The Rig, Yajur, and Sama Vedas constitute the triple covering of\nthe several castes, and the sinner who throws this off is said to be naked (or\napostate). The three Vedas are the raiment of all the orders of men, and when\nthat is discarded they are left bare 1. On this subject hear what I heard my\ngrandfather, the pious Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, relate to the magnanimous Bhishma:\n\np. 335\n\nThere was formerly a battle between the gods and demons, for the period of a\ndivine year, in which the gods were defeated by the demons under the command\nof Hrada 2. The discomfited deities fled to the northern shore of the milky\nocean, where engaging in religious penance they thus prayed to Vishn\xcc\x81u: "May\nthe first of beings, the divine Vishn\xcc\x81u, be pleased with the words that we are\nabout to address to him, in order to propitiate the lord of all worlds; from\nwhich mighty cause all created things have originated, and into whom they\nshall again dissolve! Who is able to declare his praise? We, who have been put\nto shame by the triumph of our foes, will glorify thee, although thy true\npower and might be not within the reach of words. Thou art earth, water, fire,\nair, ether, mind, crude matter, and primeval soul: all this elementary\ncreation, with or without visible form, is thy body; all, from Brahma to a\nstock, diversified by place and time. Glory to thee, who art Brahma, thy first\nform, evolved from the lotus springing from thy navel, for the purpose of\ncreation. Glory to thee, who art Indra, the sun, Rudra, the Vasus, fire, the\nwinds, and even also ourselves. Glory to they, Govinda, who art all demons,\nwhose essence is arrogance and want of discrimination, unchecked by patience\nor self-control. Glory to thee, who art the Yakshas, whose nature is charmed\nwith sounds, and whose frivolous hearts perfect knowledge cannot pervade.\nGlory to thee, who art all fiends, that walk by night, sprung from the quality\nof darkness, fierce, fraudulent, and cruel. Glory to thee, Janarddana, who art\nthat piety which is the instrument of recompensing the virtues of those who\nabide in heaven. Glory to thee, who art one with the saints, whose perfect\nnature is ever blessed, and traverses unobstructed all permeable elements.\nGlory to thee, who art one with the serpent race, double-tongued, impetuous,\ncruel, insatiate of enjoyment, and abounding with wealth. Glory to thee, who\nart one with the Rishis, whose nature is free from sin or defect, and is\nidentified with wisdom and tranquillity. Glory to thee, oh lotus-eyed, who art\none with time, the form that devours, without remorse, all created things at\nthe termination of the Kalpa. Glory to thee, who art Rudra, the being that\n\np. 336\n\ndances with delight after he has swallowed up all things, the gods and the\nrest, without distinction. Glory to thee, Janarddana, who art man, the agent\nin developing the results of that activity which proceeds from the quality of\nfoulness. Glory to thee, who art brute animals, the universal spirit that\ntends to perversity, which proceeds from the quality of darkness, and is\nencumbered with the twenty-eight kinds of obstructions 3. Glory to thee, who\nart that chief spirit which is diversified in the vegetable world, and which,\nas the essence of sacrifice, is the instrument of accomplishing the perfection\nof the universe. Glory to thee, who art every thing, and whose primeval form\nis the objects of perception, and heaven, and animals, and men, and gods.\nGlory to thee, who art the cause of causes, the supreme spirit; who art\ndistinct from us and all beings composed of intelligence and matter and the\nlike, and with whose primeval nature there is nothing that can be compared. We\nbow to thee, O lord, who hast neither colour, nor extension, nor bulk, nor any\npredicable qualities; and whose essence, purest of the pure, is appreciable\nonly by holy sages. We bow to thee, in the nature of Brahma, untreated,\nundecaying; who art in our bodies, and in all other bodies, and in all living\ncreatures; and besides whom there is nothing else. We glorify that Vasudeva,\nthe sovereign lord of all, who is without soil, the seed of all things, exempt\nfrom dissolution, unborn, eternal, being in essence the supreme condition of\nspirit, and in substance the whole of this universe."\n\nUpon the conclusion of their prayers, the gods beheld the sovereign deity\nHari, armed with the shell, the discus, and the mace, riding on Garud\xcc\x81a.\nProstrating themselves before him, they addressed him, and said, "Have\ncompassion upon us, O lord, and protect us, who have come to thee for succour\nfrom the Daityas. They have seized upon the three worlds, and appropriated the\nofferings which are our portion, taking care not to transgress the precepts of\nthe Veda. Although we, as well as they, are parts of thee, of whom all beings\nconsist, yet we behold the world impressed by the ignorance of unity, with the\nbelief of its separate existence. Engaged in the duties of their respective\norders,\n\np. 337\n\nand following the paths prescribed by holy writ, practising also religious\npenance, it is impossible for us to destroy them. Do thou, whose wisdom is\nimmeasurable, instruct us in some device by which we may be able to\nexterminate the enemies of the gods."\n\nWhen the mighty Vishn\xcc\x81u heard their request, he emitted from his body an\nillusory form, which he gave to the gods, and thus spake This deceptive vision\nshall wholly beguile the Daityas, so that, being led astray from the path of\nthe Vedas, they may be put to death; for all gods, demons, or others, who\nshall be opposed to the authority of the Veda, shall perish by my might,\nwhilst exercised for the preservation of the world. Go then, and fear not: let\nthis delusive vision precede you; it shall this day be of great service unto\nyou, oh gods!"\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[334:1](vp091.htm#fr_902) This idea is expressed in nearly the same terms in\nthe Vayu P.: \'The three Vedas are the covering of all beings, and they who\nthrow it off through delusion are called Nagnas, naked.\' The notion is\nprobably original with neither of the Puran\xcc\x81as, and the metaphorical sense of\nthe term is not that in which it was first employed; ascetics, whether of the\nBauddha or of the Digambara order of Jains, being literally Nagnas, or going\nnaked. The qualified application of it, however, was rendered necessary by the\nsame practice being familiar to ascetics of the orthodox faith. To go naked\nwas not necessarily a sign of a heretic, and therefore his nudity was\nunderstood to be, rejecting the raiment of holy writ. Thus the Vayu P. extends\nthe word to all ascetics, including naked Brahmans, who practise austerities\nfruitlessly, that is, heretically or hypocritically: \'The Brahman who\nunprofitably bears a staff, shaves his head, goes naked, makes a vow, or\nmutters prayers, all such persons are called Nagnas and the like.\'\n\n[335:2](vp091.htm#fr_903) A son of Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu ([p.\n124](vp050.htm#page_124)).\n\n[336:3](vp091.htm#fr_904) See [p. 35](vp039.htm#page_35). n.\n[5](vp039.htm#fn_171).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVIII](vp092.htm)\n\n'
