And has offered a present to his Guru (i.e. to his) teacher,\n\n3. 3 Should, with the permission (of his parents), take a wife,\n\n4\\. One who does not belong to the same Gotra,\n\n5. 5 And who is not a Sapi _n_ _d_ a relation of his mother.\n\n6. 6 The best, however, is a 'naked' girl.\n\n7. 7 Now the bath (which is taken at the end of studentship, will be described).\n\n8\\. To the north or the east of the teacher's house there is an enclosure.\n\n9\\. There the teacher sits down, facing the north, on eastward-pointed Darbha\ngrass;\n\np. 83\n\n10\\. Facing the east the student on northward-pointed Darbha grass.\n\n11\\. The teacher should besprinkle (him) with lukewarm, scented water, which\nhas been boiled with all kinds of herbs.\n\n12\\. But as if he (i.e. the student, should do so) himself\xc2\x97\n\n13. 13 (In such a way) he is alluded to in the Mantras; (therefore the besprinkling should be done rather by the student, and not by the teacher [?]).\n\n14\\. With (the verse), 'The fires which dwell in the waters' (MB. I, 7,\n1)\xc2\x97(the student[?]) pours his joined hands full of water (on the ground),\n\n15\\. And again with (the formula), 'What is dreadful in the waters, what is\ncruel in the waters, what is turbulent in the waters' (ibid. 2).\n\n16\\. With (the formula), 'The shining one I take here' (ibid. 3)\xc2\x97he\nbesprinkles himself.\n\n17\\. And again with (the formula), 'For the sake of glory, of splendour'\n(ibid. 4).\n\n18\\. And again with (the verse), 'By which you made the wife (pregnant?')\n(ibid. 5).\n\n19\\. A fourth time silently.\n\n20\\. He then should rise and should worship the sun with the Mantra, 'Rising\nwith (the Maruts) who bear shining spears' (ibid. 6-9), &c.\n\n21. 21 Optionally he may use the single sections of\n\np. 84\n\nthe Mantra separately (in the morning, at noon, and in the evening) as\nindicated in the text.\n\n22\\. He should add (the formula), 'The eye art thou' (ibid. 9) after (each of\nthe three sections of the Mantra, 6-8).\n\n23\\. With the verse, 'Loosen the highest fetter, O Varu _n_ a' (ibid. 10), he\ntakes off the girdle.\n\n24\\. After he has entertained the Brahma _n_ as with food and has eaten\nhimself, he should have his hair, his beard, the hair of his body, and his\nnails cut, so as to leave the lock of hair (as required by the custom of his\nfamily).\n\n25\\. Having bathed and adorned himself, and having put on two garments (an\nunder-garment and an upper-garment) which have not yet been washed, he should\nput a garland (on his head) with (the formula), 'Luck art thou; take delight\nin me' (ibid. 11).\n\n26\\. The two shoes (he puts on) with (the formula), 'Leaders are you; lead me'\n(ibid. 12).\n\n27\\. With (the formula), 'The Gandharva art thou' (ibid. 13), he takes a\nbamboo staff.\n\n28\\. He approaches the teacher together with the assembly (of his pupils) and\nlooks at the assembly of his teacher's (pupils) with (the words), 'Like an\neye-ball may I be dear to you' (ibid. 14).\n\n29\\. Sitting down near (the teacher) he touches the sense-organs at his head\nwith (the verse), 'The she-ichneumon, covered by the lips' (ibid. 15).\n\n30\\. Here the teacher should honour him with the Argha ceremony.\n\n31\\. (The student then) should approach a chariot yoked with oxen, and should\ntouch its two side-pieces or the two arms of the chariot-pole with\n\np. 85\n\n[paragraph continues] (the verse), 'O tree, may thy limbs be strong' (ibid.\n16).\n\n32\\. With (the last words of that verse), 'May he who stands on thee, win what\ncan be won'\xc2\x97he mounts it.\n\n33\\. Having driven (some distance) in an easterly or northerly direction, he\nturns round from left to right and comes back (to his teacher).\n\n34. 34 When he has come back, the Argha ceremony should be performed (for him by his teacher), say the Kauhaliyas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[82:1](sbe30026.htm#fr_300) 4, 1 seq. The description given in this chapter of\nthe Samavartana, or of the ceremony performed at the end of studentship, is\nopened with a few sentences referring to another section of the G _ri_ hya\nritual, namely, to marriage. It seems to me that these first Sutras of this\nchapter once formed, in a text from which Gobhila has taken them, the\nintroduction to an exposition of the wedding ceremonies, and that Gobhila was\ninduced to transfer them to the description of the Samavartana, by their\nopening words, 'A student, after he has studied the Veda, &c.' With Sutras\n1-3, comp. Khadira-G _ri_ hya I, 3, 1.\n\n[82:3](sbe30026.htm#fr_301) I prefer to supply, (with the permission) of his\nparents, and not, of his teacher. Hira _n_ yake _s_ in says, samav _ri_ tta a\n_k_ aryakulat matapitarau bibh _ri_ yat, tabhyam anu _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ato bharyam upaya\n_k_ _kh_ et.\n\n[82:5](sbe30026.htm#fr_302) Regarding the term Sapi _n_ _d_ a, see, for\ninstance, Gautama XIV, 13 (S.B.E. II, 247): 'Sapi _n_ _d_ a-relationship\nceases with the fifth or the seventh (ancestor).' Comp. Manu V, 60.\n\n[82:6](sbe30026.htm#fr_303) According to the G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha (II, 1 7.\n18), a 'naked' girl is one who has not yet the monthly period, or whose breast\nis not yet developed. Comp. Vasish _th_ a XVII, 70; Gautama XVIII, 23.\n\n[82:7](sbe30026.htm#fr_304) 7 seqq. Comp. Khadira-G _ri_ hya III, 1, 1 seqq.\n\n[83:13](sbe30026.htm#fr_305) In the Mantras prescribed for the besprinkling of\nthe student (Mantra-Brahma _n_ a I, 7, 1 seq.) there occur passages such as,\nfor instance, 'Therewith I, N.N., besprinkle myself.'\n\n[83:21](sbe30026.htm#fr_306) He may use the first section of the Mantra, which\ncontains the word pratar, in the morning, &c.\n\n[85:34](sbe30026.htm#fr_307) Instead of its being performed at the time stated\nin Sutra 30.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 5](sbe30027.htm)\n\n"
