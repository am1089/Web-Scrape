(This verse the teacher) murmurs in (the boy\'s) right ear;\n\n2\\. (The verse), \'Life-giving, Agni\' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. I, 3, 14, 4) in his\nleft ear.\n\n3. 3 Both times he adds (to the verses quoted in the last Sutras the formula), \'Stand fast in Agni and on the earth, in Vayu and in the air, in Surya and in heaven. The bliss in which Agni, Vayu, the sun, the moon, and the waters go their way, in that bliss go thy way, N.N.! Thou hast become the pupil of breath, N.N.!\'\n\n4. 4 Approaching his mouth to (the boy\'s) mouth he murmurs, \'Intelligence may Indra give thee, intelligence the goddess Sarasvati. Intelligence may the two A _s_ vins, wreathed with lotus, bestow on thee.\'\n\n5. 5 He then gives (the boy) in charge (to the gods and demons, with the formulas), \'To Kashaka (?) I\n\np. 154\n\ngive thee in charge. To Antaka I give thee in charge. To Aghora ("the not\nfrightful one") I give thee in charge. To Disease . . . to Yama . . . to Makha\n. . . to Va _s_ ini ("the ruling goddess") . . . to the earth together with\nVai _s_ vanara . . . to the waters . . . to the herbs . . . to the trees . . .\nto Heaven and Earth . . . to welfare . . . to holy lustre . . . to the Vi _s_\nve devas . . . to all beings . . . to all deities I give thee in charge.\'\n\n6. 6 He now teaches him the Savitri, if he has (already) been initiated before.\n\n7\\. If he has not been initiated (before, he teaches him the Savitri) after\nthree days have elapsed.\n\n8\\. (He does so) immediately, says Pushkarasadi.\n\n9. 9 Having placed to the west of the fire a bunch of grass with its points directed towards the north, (the teacher) sits down thereon, facing the east, with (the formula), \'A giver of royal power art thou, a teacher\'s seat. May I not withdraw from thee.\'\n\n10\\. The boy raises his joined hands towards the sun, embraces (the feet of)\nhis teacher, sits down to the south (of the teacher), addresses (him),\n\'Recite, sir!\' and then says, \'Recite the Savitri, sir!\'\n\n11\\. Having recited over (the boy the verse), \'We call thee, the lord of the\nhosts\' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. II, 3, 14, 3), he then recites (the Savitri) to him,\nfirstly Pada by Pada, then hemistich by hemistich, and then the whole verse\n(in the following way),\n\np. 155\n\n\'Bhus! Tat Savitur vare _n_ ya _m_ (That adorable splendour)\xc2\x97\n\n\'Bhuvo! Bhargo devasya dhimahi (of the divine Savit _ri_ may we obtain)\xc2\x97\n\n\'Suvar! Dhiyo yo na _h_ pra _k_ odayat (who should rouse our prayers).\xc2\x97\n\n\'Bhur bhuvas! Tat Savitur vare _n_ ya _m_ bhargo devasya dhimahi\xc2\x97\n\n\'Suvar! Dhiyo yo na _h_ pra _k_ odayat.\xc2\x97\n\n\'Bhur bhuva _h_ suvas! Tat Savitur . . . pra _k_ odayat.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[153:3](sbe30049.htm#fr_511) 6, 3. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I, 20, 8.\n\n[153:4](sbe30049.htm#fr_512) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I, 15, 2; 22, 26; Paraskara II, 4,\n8.\n\n[153:5](sbe30049.htm#fr_513) Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 3, 1; Paraskara II, 2,\n21.
