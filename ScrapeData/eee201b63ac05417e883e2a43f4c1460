One day she went crying\nto her husband and saying, 'What an unhappy woman I am to have no children!\nIf! had any children to amuse me I should be quite happy.' He answered, 'Why\nshould you be miserable on that account? though you have no children, your\nsister has eight or nine; why not adopt one of hers?' The Sowkar's wife\nagreed; and adopting one of her sister's little boys, who was only six months\nold, brought him up as her own son. Some time afterwards, when the child was\none day returning from school, he and one of his school-fellows quarrelled and\nbegan to fight, and the other boy (being much the older and stronger of the\ntwo) gave him a great blow on the head and knocked him down, and hurt him very\nmuch. The boy ran crying home, and the Sowkar's wife bathed his head and\nbandaged it up, but she did not send and punish the boy who hurt him, for she\nthought, 'One can't keep children shut up always in the house, and they will\nbe fighting together sometimes and hurting themselves.' Then the child\ngrumbled to himself, saying, 'This is only my aunt; that is why she did not\npunish the other boy. If she had been my mother she would certainly have given\nhim a great knock on his head, to punish him for knocking mine, but because\nshe is only my aunt, I suppose she doesn't care.' The Sowkar's wife overheard\nhim, and felt very grieved, saying, 'This little child, whom I have watched\nover from his babyhood, does not love me as if I were his mother. It is of no\nuse; he is not my own, and he will never care for me as such.' So she took him\nhome to his own mother, saying, 'Sister, I have brought you back your\nchild.'--'How is this?' asked her sister; 'you adopted him as yours for all\nhis life. Why do you now bring him back?' The Sowkar's wife did not tell her\nsister what she had heard the boy say, but she answered, 'Very well, let him\nbe yours and mine; he shail live a while with you, and then come and visit me;\nwe will both take care of him.' And, returning to her husband, she told him\nwhat she had done, saying, 'All my pains are useless; you know how kind I have\nbeen to my sister's boy, yet, after all I have done for him, at the end of\nseven years he does not love me as well as he does his mother, whom he has\nscarcely seen. Now, therefore, I will never rest until I have seen Mahadeo,  2\nand ask him to grant that I may have a child of my own.'  3\n\n'What a foolish woman you are!' answered her husband; 'why not be content with\nyour lot? How do you think you will find Mahadeo? Do you know the road to\nheaven?'--' Nay,' she replied, 'but I will seek for it until I find it out,\nand if I never find it, it cannot be helped, but I will return home no more\nunless my prayer is answered.' So she left the house, and wandered into the\njungle, and after she had travelled through it for many, many days and left\nher own land very far behind, she came to the borders of another country, even\nthe Madura Tinivelly  4 country, where a great river rolled down towards the\nsea. On the river-bank sat two women--a Ranee named Coplinghee Ranee, and a\nNautch woman.\n\nNow, neither the Ranee, the Nautch woman, nor the Sowkar's wife had ever seen\neach other before they met at the river-side. Then, as she sat down to rest\nand drink some of the water, the Ranee turned to the Sowkar's wife, and said\nto her, 'Who are you, and where are you going?' She answered, 'I am a Sowkar's\nWife from a far country, and because I was very unhappy at having r children,\nI am going to find Mahadeo and ask him to grant that may have a child of my\nown.'\n\nThen, in her turn, she said to the Ranee, 'And pray who are you, and where are\nyou going?' The Ranee answered, 'I am Coplinghee Ranee, queen of all this\ncountry, but neither money nor riches can give me joy, for I have no children;\nI therefore am going to seek Mahadeo and ask him to grant that I may have\nchild.' Then Coplinghee Ranee asked the Nautch woman the same question,\nsaying, 'And who may you be, and where are ye going?' The Nautch woman\nanswered, 'I am a dancing-woman and I also have no children, and am going to\nseek Mahadeo an pray to him for a child.' At hearing this, the Sowkar's wife\nsaid 'Since we are all journeying on the same errand, why should we not go\ntogether?' To this Coplinghee Ranee and the Dancing woman agreed, so they all\nthree continued their journey together through the jungle.\n\nOn, on, on they went, every day further and further; they never stayed to\nrest, nor saw another human being. Their feet ached dreadfully, and their\nclothes wore out, and they had nothing to live on but the jungle-plants, wild\nberries and seeds. So weary and worn did they become that they looked like\nthree poor old beggar-women. Never had they by night-time sleep, nor by day\ntime rest; and so, hour after hour, month after month, year after year, they\ntravelled on.\n\nAt last, one day, they came to where, in the midst of the jungle there rolled\na great river of fire. It was the biggest river they ha ever seen, and made of\nflames instead of water. There was no one on this side and no one on that; no\nway of getting across but but walking through the fire.\n\nWhen Coplinghee Ranee and the Nautch woman saw this, the said, 'Alas! here is\nthe end of all our pains and trouble. All hop is over, for we can go no\nfurther.' But the Sowkar's wife answere 'Shall we be deterred by this, after\nhaving come so far? Nay, rather seek a way across the fire.' And, so saying,\nshe stepped into the fire waves; the others, however, were afraid, and would\nnot go. When the Sowkar's wife had half crossed the river of fir she turned,\nand waving her hands towards them, said, 'Come on come on! do not be afraid.\nThe fire does not burn me. I go find Mahadeo; perhaps he is but the other\nside.'  5 But they still refused, saying, 'We cannot come, but we will wait\nhere until you return; and if you find Mahadeo, pray for us also, that we may\nhave children.'\n\nSo the Sowkar's wife went on her way, and the fire waves lapped round her feet\nas if they had been water, but they did not hurt her.\n\nWhen she reached the other side of the river she came upon a great wilderness,\nfull of wild elephants, and of bison, and lions, and tigers, and bears, that\nroared and growled on every side. But she did not turn back for fear of them,\nfor she said to herself, 'I can but die once, and it is better that they\nshould kill me, than that I should return without finding Mahadeo.' And all\nthe wild beasts allowed her to pass through the midst of them and did her no\nharm.\n\nNow it came to pass that Mahadeo looked down from heaven and saw her, and when\nhe saw her he pitied her greatly, for she had been twelve years wandering upon\nthe face of the earth to find him. Then he caused a beautiful mango-tree,\nbeside a fair well, to spring up in the desert to give her rest and\nrefreshment, and he himself in the disguise of a Gosain Fakeer,  6 came and\nstood by the tree. But the Sowkar's wife would not stay to gather the fruit or\ndrink the water; she did not so much as notice the Fakeer, but walked straight\non, in her weary search for Mahadeo. Then he called after her, 'Bai, Bai,\nwhere are you going? Come here.' She answered, scarcely looking at him, 'It\nmatters not to you, Fakeer, where I am going. You tell your prayer-beads, and\nleave me alone.'--'Come here,' he cried; 'come here!' But she would not, so\nMahadeo went and stood in front of her, no longer disguised as a Fakeer, but\nshining brightly, the Lord of Kylas  7 in all his beauty, and at the sight of\nhim the poor Sowkar's wife fell down on the ground and kissed his feet; and he\nsaid to her, 'Tell me, Bai, where are you going?' She answered, 'Sir, I seek\nMahadeo, to pray him to grant that I may have a child, but for twelve years I\nhave looked for him in vain.' He said, 'Seek no further, for I am Mahadeo;\ntake this mango,' and he gathered one off the tree that grew by the well, 'and\neat it, and it shall come to pass that when you return home you shall have a\nchild.' Then she said, 'Sir, three women came seeking you, but two stayed by\nthe river of fire, for they were afraid; may not they also have children?'\n\n'If you will,' he answered, 'you may give them some of your mango, and then\nthey also will each have a child.'\n\nSo saying, he faded from her sight, and the Sowkar's wife returned, glad and\njoyful, through the wilderness and the river of fire, to where the Ranee and\nthe Dancing-woman were waiting for her on the other side. When they saw her,\nthey said, 'Well, Sowkar's wife, what news?' She answered, 'I have found\nMahadeo, and he has given me this mango, of which if we eat we shall each have\na child.' And she took the mango, and squeezing it, gave the juice to the\nRanee, and the skin she gave to the Nautch woman, and the pulp and the stone\nshe ate herself.\n\nThen these three women returned to their own homes; Coplinghee Ranee and the\nDancing-woman to the Madura Tinivelly country, and the Sowkar's wife to very,\nvery far beyond that, even the land where her husband lived, and whence she\nhad first started on her journey.\n\nBut, on their return, all their friends only laughed at them, and the Sowkar\nsaid to his wife, 'I cannot see much good in your mad twelve years' journey;\nyou only come back looking like a beggar, and all the world laughs at\nyou.'--'I don't care,' she answered; 'I have seen Mahadeo, and eaten of the\nmango, and I shall have a child.' And within a while it came to pass that\nthere was born to the Sowkar and his wife a little son, and on the very same\nday Coplinghee Ranee had a daughter, and the Nautch woman had a daughter.\n\nThen were they all very happy, and sent everywhere to tell their friends the\ngood news; and each gave, according to her power, a great feast to the poor,\nas a thank-offering to Mahadeo, who had been merciful to them. And the\nSowkar's wife called her son 'Koila,'  8 in memory of the mango stone; and the\nNautch woman called her daughter 'Moulee;  9 and the little Princess was named\nChandra Bai,  10 for she was as fair and beautiful as the white moon.\n\nChandra Ranee was very beautiful, the most beautiful child in all that\ncountry, so pretty and delicately made that everybody, when they saw her,\nloved her. She was born, moreover, with, on her ankles, two of the most costly\nanklets that ever were seen. They were made of gold and very precious stones,\ndazzling to look at, like the sun. No one had ever seen any like them before.\n\nEvery day as the baby grew, these bangles grew, and round them were little\nbells, which tinkled when any one came near. Chandra's parents were very happy\nand proud, and sent for all the wise men in the kingdom to tell her fortune.\nBut the most learned of the Brahmans, when he saw her, said, 'This child must\nbe sent out of the country at once, for if she stays in it she will destroy\nall the land with fire, and burn it utterly.'\n\nThe Rajah, at hearing these words, was very angry, and said to the Brahman, 'I\nwill cut off your head, for you tell lies and not the truth.' The Brahman\nanswered, 'Cut off my head if you will, but it is the truth I speak, and no\nlie. If you do not believe me, let a little wool be fetched, and put it upon\nthe child, that you may know my words are true.'\n\nSo they fetched some wool and laid it upon the baby, and no sooner had they\ndone so, than it all blazed up and burned till not a bit was left, and it\nscorched the hands of the attendants.\n\nThen the Brahman said, 'As this fire has burned the wool, so will this\nPrincess one day, if she comes here, burn this whole land.  11 And they were\nall very much frightened, and the Rajah said to the Ranee, 'This being so, the\nchild must be sent out of the country instantly.' The poor Ranee thereat was\nvery sad, and she did -all in her power to save her little baby, but the Rajah\nwould not hear of it, and commanded that the Princess should be placed in a\nlarge box, and taken to the borders of his land, where a great river rolled\ndown to the sea, and there thrown into the stream, that it might carry her\nfar, far away, each minute further from her native land.' Then the Ranee\ncaused a beautiful golden box to be made, and put her little baby in it, with\nmany tears (since all her efforts to save it were of no avail), and it was\ntaken away and thrown into the river.\n\nThe box floated on, and on, and on, until at last it reached the country where\nthe Sowkar and the Sowkar's wife lived. Now it chanced that,just as the box\nwas floating by, the Sowkar, who had gone down to the river to wash his face,\ncaught sight of it, and seeing a fisherman, not far off, prepared to throw his\nnet into the water, he cried, 'Run, Fisherman, run, run, do not stop to fish,\nbut cast your net over that glittering box and bring it here to me.'\n\n'I will not, unless you promise me that the box shall be mine,' said the\nFisherman. 'Very well,' answered the Sowkar; 'the box shall be yours, and\nwhatever it contains shall belong to me.'\n\nSo the Fisherman cast his net in that part of the river, and dragged the box\nashore.\n\nI don't know which was most astonished, the Merchant or the Fisherman, when\nthey saw what a prize they had found. For the box was composed entirely of\ngold and precious stones, and within it lay the most lovely little child that\never was seen.\n\nShe seemed a little Princess, for her dress was all made of cloth of gold, and\non her feet were two anklets that shone like the sun.\n\nWhen the Sowkar opened the box, she smiled, and stretched out her little arms\ntowards him. Then he was pleased, and said, 'Fisherman, the box is yours, but\nthis child must belong to me.' The Fisherman was content that it should be so,\nfor he had many children of his own at home, and wanted no more, but was glad\nto have the golden box; while the Sowkar, who had only his one little son, and\nwas rich, did not care for the box, but was well pleased to have the baby.\n\nHe took her home to his wife, and said, 'See, wife, here is a pretty little\ndaughter-in-law for us. Here is a wife for your little son.' And when the\nSowkar's wife saw the child looking so beautiful and smiling so sweetly, her\nheart was glad, and she loved her, and from that day took the greatest care of\nher, just as if the baby-girl had been her own daughter. And when Chandra\nRanee was a year old, they married her to their son, Koila.\n\nYears wore on, and the Sowkar and his wife were in a good old age gathered to\ntheir fathers. Meantime, Koila and Chandra had grown up the handsomest couple\nin all the country: Koila tall and straight, with a face like a young lion,\nand Chandra as lithe and graceful as a palm-tree, with a face calm and\nbeautiful like the silver moonlight.\n\nMeantime, 'Moulee,' the Nautch woman's daughter (and third of the mango\nchildren), had likewise grown up, in the Madura Tinivelly country, and was\nalso very fair, fairer than any one in all the land around. Moreover, she\ndanced and sang more beautifully than any of the other Nautch girls. Her voice\nwas clear as the voice of a quail, and it rang through the air with such power\nthat the sound could be heard a twelve-days' journey off. The Nautch people\nused to travel about from place to place, staying one day in one town and the\nnext in another, and so it happened that in their wanderings they reached the\nborders of the land where Koila and Chandra lived.\n\nOne morning Koila heard the sound of singing in the distance, and it pleased\nhim so well that he determined to try and discover who it was that possessed\nsuch an exquisite voice. For twelve days he journeyed on through the jungle,\neach day hearing the singing repeated louder and louder, yet still without\nreaching the place whence it came. At last, on the twelfth day, he got close\nto the Nautch people's encampment, not far from a large town, and there saw\nthe singer (who was none other than Moulee), singing and dancing in the midst\nof a great crowd of people who had collected around her. In her hand she held\na garland of flowers, which she waved over her head as she danced.\n\nKoila was so charmed with the sound of her voice that he felt spell-bound, and\nstood where he was, far off on the outskirts of the jungle, listening, without\ngoing any nearer.\n\nWhen the entertainment was over, all the people crowded round Moulee, saying,\n'Why should you, who have such a beautiful voice, go away and leave our city?\nMarry one of us, and then you will stay here always.' Then, the number of her\nsuitors being so great that she did not know whom to choose, she said, 'Very\nwell, he on whose neck this garland falls shall be my husband.' And waving the\nflowers she held two or three times round her head, she threw them from her\nwith her utmost force.\n\nThe impetus given to the garland was so great that it swang through the air\nbeyond the crowd and fell upon the neck of Koila as he stood by the borders of\nthe jungle. All the people ran to see who was the fortunate possessor, and\nwhen they saw Koila they were astonished, for he looked more beautiful than\nany of the sons of men; it was as if an Immortal had suddenly come among them.\nAnd the Nautch people dragged him back to their camp, crying, 'You have won\nthe garland; you must be Moulee's husband.' He answered, 'I only came here to\nlook on; I cannot stay. This is not my country; I have a wife of my own at\nhome.'--'That is nothing to us,' they said; 'it is your destiny to marry\nMoulee,--Moulee the beautiful one, Moulee whose voice you heard, and who\ndances so well. You must marry her, for the garland fell on you'\n\nNow so it was, that though Koila was very kind to his wife, he did not love\nher as well as she loved him (perhaps it was that having been accustomed to\nher from a child, Chandra's goodness and beauty struck him less than it did\nother people), and instead of thinking how unhappy she would be if he did not\nreturn, and go back at once, he stopped, and hesitated, and debated what to\ndo. And the Nautch people gave him a drink that was a very powerful spell,\ninsomuch that he soon totally forgot about his own home, and was married to\nMoulee, the Nautch girl, and lived among the Nautch people for many months. At\nlast, one day, Moulee's mother (the very Nautch woman who had gone with\nCoplinghee Ranee and the Sowkar's wife to find Mahadeo) said to Koila, 'Son-\nin-law, you are a lazy fellow; you have been here now for a long time, but you\ndo nothing for your support; it is we who have to pay for your food, we who\nhave to provide your clothes--go now and fetch us some money, or I will turn\nyou out of the house and you shall never see your wife Moulee again. Koila had\nno money to give his mother-in-law; then, for the first time, he bethought him\nof his own country and of Chandra, and he said, 'My first wife, who lives in\nmy own country, has on her feet two bangles of very great value; let me return\nhome and fetch one of them to sell, which will more than pay whatever I owe\nyou.' The Nautch people consented. So Koila returned to his own home, and told\nChandra what he wanted the money for, and asked her to let him have one of her\nbangles, but she refused, saying, 'You have been away a long, long time and\nleft me all alone, and chosen for your second wife one of the Nautch people,\nand become one of them, and now you want to take one of my bangles, the\nbangles that I had when a little child, that have grown with my growth, and\nnever been taken off, and to give it to your other wife. This shall not be; go\nback if you will to your new friends, but I will not give you my bangle.'\n\nHe answered, 'They gave me an enchanted drink which made me forget you for a\ntime, but I am weary of them all; let me but go and pay my mother-in-law the\nmoney I owe her for food and clothes, and I will return and live in my own\nland, for you are my first wife.'\n\n'Very well,' she said, 'you may take tile bangle and sell it, and give the\nmoney to your second wife's mother, but take me also with you when you go; do\nnot leave me here all alone again.' Koila agreed, and they both set off\ntogether towards the Madura Tinivelly country.\n\nAs they journeyed, Krishnaswami,  12who was playing at cards with his three\nwives, saw them, and when he saw them he laughed. Then his wives said to him,\n'Why do you laugh? You have not laughed for such a long time, what amuses you\nso much now?' He answered, 'I am laughing to see Koila and his wife Chandra\nRanee journeying towards the Madura Tinivelly country. He is going to sell his\nwife's bangle, and he will only be killed, and then she in anger will burn up\nall the country. O foolish people!' The goddesses answered, 'This is a very\ndreadful thing; let us go in disguise, and warn him not to enter the\ncountry.'--' It would be useless,' said Krishnaswami; 'if you do, he will only\nlaugh at you and get angry with you.' But the goddesses determined to do their\nbest to avert the threatened calamity. So they disguised themselves as old\nfortune-tellers, and went out with little lamps and their sacred books, to\nmeet Koila as he came along the road followed by his wife. Then they said to\nhim, 'Come not into the Madura Tinivelly country, for if you come you will be\nkilled, and your wife in her fury will burn all the land with fire.' At first,\nKoila would not listen to them; then he bade them go away; and lastly, when\nthey continued warning him, got angry, and beat them out of his path, saying,\n'Do you think I am to be frightened out of the country by a parcel of old\ncrones like you?'\n\nThen Krishnaswami's three wives returned to him, much enraged at the treatment\nthey had received, but he only said to them, 'Did not I tell you not to go,\nwarning you that it would be useless?'\n\nOn getting near the Rajah's capital, Koila and Chandra came to the house of an\nold milk-seller, who was very kind to them, and gave them food and shelter for\nthe night. Next morning Koila said to his wife, 'You had better stay here;\nthis good old woman will take care of you, while I go into the town to sell\nyour bangle.' Chandra agreed, and remained at the old woman's house while her\nhusband went into the town. Of course he did not know that the Rajah and his\nwife (the Coplinghee Ranee) were Chandra's father and mother, any more than\nthey, or Chandra herself, knew it, or than the three Mango children knew the\nstory of their mothers' journey in search of Mahadeo.\n\nNow a short time before Koila and Chandra reached the Madura Tinivelly\ncountry, Coplinghee Ranee had sent a very handsome pair of bangles to a\nJeweller in the town to be cleaned. It chanced that in a high tree close to\nthe Jeweller's house two eagles had built their nest, and the young eagles,\nwho were very noisy birds, used to scream all day long, and greatly disturb\nthe Jeweller's family. So one day when the old birds were away, the Jeweller's\nson climbed the tree, and pulled down the nest, and put the young eagles to\ndeath. When the old birds returned home and saw what was done, it grieved them\nvery much, and they said, 'These cruel people have killed our children, let us\npunish them.' And seeing in the porch one of Coplinghee Ranee's beautiful\nbangles, which the Jeweller had just been cleaning, they swooped down and flew\naway with it.  13\n\nThe Jeweller did not know what to do; he said to his wife, 'To buy such a\nbangle as that would cost more than all our fortune, and to make one like it\nwould take many, many years; I dare not say I have lost it, or they would\nthink I had stolen it, and put me to death. The only thing I can do is to\ndelay returning the other as long as possible, and try somehow to get one like\nit.' So next day when the Ranee sent to inquire if her bangles were ready, he\nanswered, 'They are not ready yet; they will be ready to-morrow.' And the next\nday, and the next, he said the same thing. At last the Ranee's messengers got\nvery angry at the continued delays; then, seeing he could no longer make\nexcuses, the Jeweller sent the one bangle by them to the palace, beautifully\ncleaned, with a message that the other also would shortly be ready, but all\nthis time he was hunting for a bangle costly enough to take the Ranee as a\nsubstitute for the one the eagles had carried away. Such a bangle, however, he\ncould not find.\n\nWhen Koila reached the town, he spread out a sheet in the corner of a street\nnear the market-place, and, placing Chandra's bangle upon it, sat down close\nby, waiting for customers. Now, he was very, very handsome. Although dressed\nso plainly, he looked like a Prince, and the bangle he had to sell flashed in\nthe morning light like seven suns. Such a handsome youth, and such a beautiful\nbangle, the people had never seen before; and many passers-by, with chattees\non their heads, for watching him let the chattees tumble down and break, they\nwere so much astonished; and several men and women, who were looking out of\nthe windows of their houses, leant too far forward, and fell into the street,\nso giddy did they become from wonder and amazement!\n\nBut no one could be found to buy the bangle, for they all said 'We cannot\nafford such jewels; this bangle is fit only for a Ranee to wear.' At last,\nwhen the day had nearly gone, who should come by but the Jeweller who had been\nemployed to clean Coplinghee Ranee's bangles, and who was in search of one to\nreplace that which the eagles had stolen. No sooner did he see the one\nbelonging to Chandra, which Koila was trying to sell, than he said to himself,\n'That is the very thing I want, if I can only get it.' So he called his wife,\nand said to her, 'Go to that bangle-seller and speak kindly to him; say that\nthe day is nearly gone, and invite him to come and lodge at our house for the\nnight. For if we can make friends with him and get him to trust us, I shall be\nable to take the bangle from him, and say he stole it from me. And as he is a\nstranger here, every one will believe my word rather than his. This bangle is\nexactly the thing for me to take Coplinghee Ranee, for it is very like her\nown, only more beautiful.'\n\nThe Jeweller's wife did as she was told, and then the Jeweller himself went up\nto Koila and said to him, 'You are a bangle-seller, and I am a bangle-seller;\ntherefore I look upon you as a brother. Come home, I pray you, with us, as my\nwife begs you to do, and we will give you food and shelter for the night,\nsince you are a stranger in this country.' So these cunning people coaxed\nKoila to go home with them to their house, and pretended to be very kind to\nhim, and gave him supper, and a bed to rest on for the night; but next morning\nearly the Jeweller raised a hue and cry, and sent for the police, and bade\nthem take Koila before the Rajah instantly, since he had stolen and tried to\nsell one of Coplinghee Ranee's bangles which he (the Jeweller) had been given\nto clean. It was in vain that Koila protested his innocence, and declared that\nthe bangle he had belonged to his wife; he was a stranger--nobody would\nbelieve him. They dragged him to the palace, and the Jeweller accused him to\nthe Rajah, saying, This man tried to steal the Ranee's bangle (which I had\nbeen given to clean) and to sell it. If he had done so, you would have thought\nI had stolen it, and killed me; I demand, therefore, that he in punishment\nshall be put to death.'\n\nThen they sent for the Ranee to show her the bangle, but as soon as she saw it\nshe recognised it as one of the bangles which had belonged to Chandra, and\nburst into tears, crying, 'This is not my bangle. O my lord, no jeweller on\nearth made this bangle! See, it is different from mine; and when any one comes\nnear it, it tinkles, and all the little bells begin to ring. Have you\nforgotten it? This was my beauty's bangle! my diamond's! my little darling's!\nmy lost child's! Where did it come from? How did it come here? How into this\nland, and into this town and bazaar, among these wicked people? For this\nJeweller must have kept my bangle and brought this one in its place. No human\ngoldsmith's hands made this; for it is none other than Chandra's.' Then she\nbegged the Rajah to inquire further about it.\n\nBut they all thought her mad; and the Jeweller said, 'It is the Ranee's fancy,\nfor this is the same bangle she gave me to clean.' The other people also\nagreed that both the bangles were almost exactly alike, and must be a pair;\nand it being certain that Koila had had the bangle when he was seized by the\npolice, the Rajah ordered him to be instantly executed. But the Ranee took\nChandra's bangle and locked it away in a strong cupboard, apart from all her\nother jewels.\n\nThen they took Koila out into the jungle and would have cut off his head, but\nhe said to his guards, 'If I must die, let me die by my own hands,' and\ndrawing his sword he fell upon it, and as the sword was very sharp it cut his\nbody in two--one half fell on one side of the sword, and the other half on the\nother side--and they left his body where it fell.\n\nWhen news of what had taken place came to the town, many people who had seen\nKoila selling his bangle the day before began to murmur, saying, 'There must\nbe some injustice here--the Rajah has been over-hasty. Most likely the poor\nman did not steal the bangle. He would not have tried to sell it openly before\nus all in the bazaar if it had been stolen property. How cruel of the Rajab to\nput such a handsome, gentle, noble-looking youth to death--and he was a\nstranger too!' And many wept at thought of his hard fate. When the Rajah heard\nof this he was very angry, and sent and commanded that the matter should be no\nfurther discussed in the town, saying, 'If any one speaks another word of what\nhas been done, or laments or sheds tears for the dead, he shall be instantly\nhanged.' Then the people all felt very frightened, and not a soul dared to\nspeak of Koila, though every one thought about him much.\n\nEarly the very morning that this happened, the old milk-seller (at whose\nhouse, which was a little out of the town, Chandra had been sleeping), took\nher guest a bowl full of milk to drink; but no sooner had Chandra tasted it\nthan she began to cry, saying, 'Good mother, what have you done? my mouth is\nfull of blood!'--'No, no, my daughter,' answered the old woman; 'you must have\nbeen dreaming some bad dream. See, this is pure, fresh, warm milk I have\nbrought you; drink again.' But when Chandra tasted it for the second time, she\nanswered, 'Oh no! Oh no! it is not milk that I taste, but blood. All last\nnight I had a dreadful dream, and this morning when I woke I found that my\nmarriage necklace had snapped in two; and now this milk tastes to me as blood.\nLet me go! let me go! for I know my husband is dead.'\n\nThe good old woman tried to comfort her, saying, 'Why should you fancy he is\ndead? He was quite well yesterday, when he went to sell your bangle; and he\nsaid he would come back to you soon; in a little while, very likely, he will\nbe here.' But she answered, 'No, no; I feel sure that he is dead! Oh, let me\ngo! for I must find him before I die.' Then the old woman said, 'You must not\ngo; you are too beautiful to run about through the streets of this strange\ntown alone; and your husband would be very angry if he saw you doing so, and\nwho knows but that you might lose your way, and get carried off as a slave?\nremember, he told you to stay here till he returned. Be patient; remain where\nyou are, and I will go quickly into the town and seek your husband. If he is\nalive I will bring him back to you, and if he is dead I will bring you word.'\nSo, taking a chattee full of milk on her head, as if to sell, she went to the\ntown to find Koila, while every minute seemed an hour to Chandra, until her\nreturn.\n\nWhen the old milk-seller reached the town, she went up and down all the\nstreets, looking for Koila, or expecting to hear some one mention the handsome\nstranger who had gone to sell such a wonderful bangle the day before. But she\ncould not find him, nor did she hear him spoken of; for all were afraid to say\na word about him, on account of the Rajah's decree. Being unable to trace him,\nthe old woman got suspicious, and began to search more carefully than before,\ndown all the streets near the marketplace, where she thought he was most\nlikely to have gone; but, lest people should wonder at her errand, she called\nout each time as if she had some different thing to sell. First, 'Buy some\nmilk--who 'll buy milk--who 'll buy?' Then, on going for a second time down\nthe same street, 'Buy butter--butter! very fine butter!' and so on. At last\none woman, who had been watching her with some curiosity, said, 'Old woman,\nwhat nonsense you talk! you have been half a dozen times up and down this same\nstreet, as if you had half a dozen different things to sell in that one\nchattee. Any one would think you had as little sense as that pretty young\nbangle-seller yesterday, who spent all the day trying to sell it, and got put\nto death for his pains.'\n\n'Of whom do you speak?' asked the old woman. 'Oh!' said the other, 'I suppose\nas you're a milk-seller from the country you know nothing about it. But that's\nnot to be talked about, for the Rajah has said that whoever speaks of him, or\nmourns him, shall be instantly hanged. Ah! he was very handsome.'\n\n'Where is he now?' whispered the old woman. 'There, answered the other; 'you\ncan see the place where that crowd of people has collected. The Rajab's\nJeweller accused him of having stolen the bangle; so he was executed; many\nthought unjustly, but do not say I said it.' And so saying, she pointed\ntowards the jungle some way off. The old woman ran to the place; but when she\nthere saw the two halves of Koila's body lying side by side, stiff and cold,\nshe threw her earthen chattee down on the ground, and fell on her knees,\ncrying bitterly. The noise attracted the attention of the Rajab's guards, some\nof whom immediately seized her, saying, 'Old woman, it is against the law to\nlament that dead man, or murmur at the Rajah's decree; you deserve to be put\nto death.' But she answered quickly, 'The dead man! I do not cry for the dead\nman; can you not see that my chattee is broken, and all the milk spilt? Is it\nnot enough to make one weep?' And she began to cry again. 'Hush! hush!' they\nanswered; 'don't cry; come, the chattee wasn't worth much; it was only an\nearthen thing. Stop your tears, and may be we'll give you a chattee of gold.'\n\n'I neither care for your golden chattees, nor for silver,' she said angrily.\n'Go away; go away! my earthen chattee was worth them all. My grandfather's\ngrandfather and my grandmother's grandmother used this chattee; and to think\nthat it should now be broken and all the milk spilt.' And picking up the\nbroken pieces, she went home sobbing, as if the loss of her chattee was all\nher grief. But when she got to her own house, she ran in to where Chandra was,\ncrying, 'Alas, my pretty child! alas, my daughter! your fears are true!' and\nas gently as she could she told her what had happened.\n\nNo sooner did Chandra hear it than she ran away straight to the Rajah's Palace\nin the midst of the town, and rushing into the room where he was, said, 'How\ndid you dare to kill my husband?'\n\nNow, at the sound of her voice, her bangle, which the Ranee had locked up in\nthe cupboard, broke through all the intervening doors, and rolled to Chandra's\nfeet.\n\nThe Rajah was unable to answer her a word. Then she fell on her knees, and\nrent her clothes, and tore her hair; and when she tore it all the land began\nto burn, and all her hair burned too.\n\nThen the old milk-seller, who bad followed her, ran and put a lump of butter\non her head, thinking to cool it; and two other women who were by fetched\nwater to pour upon her hair, but by this time nineteen lines of houses were in\nflames. Then the old woman cried, 'Oh! spare the Purwari  14 lines; don't burn\nthem down, for I did all I could for you.' So Chandra did not burn that part\nof the town near which the old woman and her friends lived. But the fire burnt\non and on in the other direction; and it killed the Rajah and the Ranee, and\nall the people in the palace; and the wicked Jeweller and his wife--and, as he\nwas dying, Chandra tore out his heart and gave it to the eagles who hovered\noverhead, saying, 'Here is vengeance for the death of your little ones.' And\nthe Nautch girl, Moulee, and her mother, who were watching the fire from far\noff, were smothered in the flames.  15\n\nThen Chandra went to where Koila's dead body lay, and wept over it bitterly;\nand as she was weeping, there fell down to her from heaven a needle and\nthread; and she took them, saying, 'Oh that I could by any means restore you!'\nand, placing the two halves of his body side by side, she sewed them together.\n\nAnd when she had done this, she cried to Mahadeo, saying, 'Sire, I have done\nthe best I can; I have joined the body; give it life.' And as she said these\nwords Mahadeo had pity on her, and he sent Koila's spirit back, and it\nreturned to his body again. Then Chandra was glad, and they returned and lived\nin their own land.\n\nBut to this day in the Madura Tinivelly country you can trace where all the\nland was burnt\n\n![](img/47.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd26.htm#fr_79) Merchant's.\n\n[2](odd26.htm#fr_80) The Creator.\n\n[3](odd26.htm#fr_81) See Notes.\n\n[4](odd26.htm#fr_82) Two provinces of the Madras Presidency on the mainland\nopposite Ceylon.
