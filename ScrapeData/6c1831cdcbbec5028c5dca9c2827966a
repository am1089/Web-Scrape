 3  \nAnd thus in meditation he  \nEntered the path of poesy.  \nThen clearly, through his virtue's might,  \nAll lay discovered to his sight,  \nWhate'er befell, through all their life,  \nRama, his brother, and his wife:  \nAnd Das'aratha and each queen  \nAt every time, in every scene:  \nHis people too, of every sort;  \nThe nobles of his princely court:  \nWhate'er was said, whate'er decreed,  \nEach time they sate each plan and deed:  \nFor holy thought and fervent rite  \nHad so refined his keener sight  \nThat by his sanctity his view  \nThe present, past, and future knew,  \nAnd he with mental eye could grasp,  \nLike fruit within his fingers clasp,  \nThe life of Rama, great and good,  \nRoaming with Sita in the wood.  \nHe told, with secret piercing eyes,  \nThe tale of Rama's high emprise.  \nEach listening ear that shall entice,  \nA sea of pearls of highest price.  \nThus good Valmiki, sage divine,  \nRehearsed the tale of Raghu's line,  \nAs Narad, heavenly saint, before  \nHad traced the story's outline o'er.  \nHe sang of Rama's princely birth,  \nHis kindness and heroic worth;  \nHis love for all, his patient youth,  \nHis gentleness and constant truth,  \nAnd many a tale and legend old  \nBy holy Vis'vamitra told.  \nHow Janak's child he wooed and won,  \nAud broke the bow that bent to none.  \nHow he with every virtue fraught  \nHis namesake Rama  4 met and fought.  \nThe choice of Rama for the throne;  \nThe malice by Kalseyi shown,  \nWhose evil counsel marred the plan  \nAnd drove him forth a banisht man.  \nHow the king grieved and groaned,and cried,  \n\nAnd swooned away and pining died.  \nThe subjects' woe when thus bereft;  \nAnd how the following crowds he left:  \nWith Guha talked, and firmly stern  \nOrdered his driver to return.  \nHow Ganga's farther shore he gained;  \nBy Bharadvaja entertained,  \nBy whose advice be journeyed still  \nAnd came to Chitrakuta's hill.  \nHow there he dwelt and built a cot;  \nHow Bharat journeyed to the spot;  \nHis earnest supplication made;  \nDrink-offerings to their father paid;  \nThe sandals given by Rama's hand,  \nAs emblems of his right to stand:  \nHow from his presence Bharat went  \nAnd years in Nandigrama spent.  \nHow Rama entered Dandak wood  \nAnd in Sutikhna's presence stood.  \nThe favour Anasuya showed,  \nThe wondrous balsam she bestowed.  \nHow Sarabhanga's dwelling place  \nThey sought; saw Indra face to face;  \nThe meeting with Agastya gained;  \nThe heavenly bow from him obtained.  \nHow Rama with Viradha met;  \nTheir home in Panchavata set.  \nHow S'urpanakha underwent  \nThe mockery and disfigurement.  \nOf Trigira's and Khara's fall,  \nOf Ravan roused at vengeance call,  \nMaricha doomed, without escape;  \nThe fair Videhan  1b lady's rape.  \nHow Rama wept and raved in vain,  \nAnd how the Vulture-king was slain.  \nHow Rama fierce Kabandha slew;  \nThen to the side of Pampa drew.  \nMet Hanuman, and her whose vows  \nWere kept beneath the greenwood boughs.  \nHow Raghu's son the lofty-souled,  \nOn Pampa's bank wept uncontrolled,  \nThen journeyed, Rishyamuk to reach,  \nAnd of Sugriva then had speech.  \nThe friendship made, which both had sought:  \nHow Bali and Sugriva fought.  \nHow Bali in the strife was slain,  \nAnd how Sugriva came to reign.  \nThe treaty, Tara's wild lament;  \nThe rainy nights in watching spent.  \nThe wrath of Raghu's lion son;  \nThe gathering of the hosts in one.  \nThe sending of the spies about,  \nAnd all the regions pointed out.  \nThe ring by Rama's hand bestowed;  \nThe cave wherein the bear abode.  \nThe fast proposed, their lives to end;  \nSampati gained to be their friend.  \n\np. 10  \n\nThe scaling of the hill, the leap  \nOf Hanuman across the deep.  \nOcean's command that bade them seek  \nMainaka of the lofty peak.  \nThe death of Sinhika, the sight  \nOf Lanka with her palace bright  \nHow Hanuman stole in at eve;  \nHis plan the giants to deceive.  \nHow through the square he made his way  \nTo chambers where the women lay,  \nWithin the As'oka garden came  \nAnd there found Rama's captive dame,  \nHis colloquy with her he sought,  \nAnd giving of the ring he brought.  \nHow Sita gave a gem o'erjoyed;  \nHow Hanuman the grove destroyed,  \nHow giantesses trembling fled,  \nAnd servant fiends were smitten dead.  \nHow Hanuman was seized; their ire  \nWhen Lanka blazed with hostile fire.  \nHis leap across the sea once more;  \nThe eating of the honey store,  \nHow Rama he consoled, and how  \nHe showed the gem from Sita's brow,  \nWith Ocean, Rama's interview;  \nThe bridge that Nala o'er it threw.  \nThe crossing, and the sitting down  \nAt night round Lanka's royal town.  \nThe treaty with Vibhishan made:  \nThe plan for Ravan's slaughter laid.  \nHow Kumbhakarna in his pride  \nAnd Meghanada fought and died.  \nHow Ravan in the fight was slain,  \nAnd captive Sita brought again.  \nVibhishan set upon the throne;  \nThe flying chariot Pushpak shown.  \nHow Brahma and the Gods appeared,  \nAnd Sita's doubted honour cleared.  \nHow In the flying car they rode  \nTo Bharadvaja's cabin abode,  \nThe Wind-God's son sent on afar;  \nHow Bharat met the flying car.  \nHow Rama then was king ordained;  \nThe legions their discharge obtained.  \nHow Rama cast his queen away;  \nHow grew the people's love each day.  \nThus did the saint Valmiki tell  \nWhate'er in Rama's life befell,  \nAnd in the closing verse all  \nThat yet to come will once befall  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[8:1b](ry004.htm#fr_48) Sita, daughter of Janak king of Mithila.\n\n[8:2b](ry004.htm#fr_49) 'I congratulate myself,' says Schlegel in the preface\nto his, alas, unfinished edition of the Ramayan, 'that, by the favour of the\nSupreme Deity, I have been allowed to begin so great a work;
