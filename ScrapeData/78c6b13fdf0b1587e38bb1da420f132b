Harish Kundu was extorting the expenses from his tenantry. Pandits\nKaviratna and Vidyavagish had been commissioned to compose a hymn with a\ndouble meaning.\n\nMy master has just had a passage at arms with Sandip over this. "Evolution is\nat work amongst the gods as well," says Sandip. "The grandson has to remodel\nthe gods created by the grandfather to suit his own taste, or else he is left\nan atheist. It is my mission to modernize the ancient deities. I am born the\nsaviour of the gods, to emancipate them from the thraldom of the past."\n\nI have seen from our boyhood what a juggler with ideas is Sandip. He has no\ninterest in discovering truth, but to make a quizzical display of it rejoices\nhis heart. Had he been born in the wilds of Africa he would have spent a\nglorious time inventing argument after argument to prove that cannibalism is\nthe best means of promoting true communion between man and man. But those who\ndeal in delusion end by deluding themselves, and I fully believe that, each\ntime Sandip creates a new fallacy, he persuades himself that he has found the\ntruth, however contradictory his creations may . be to one another.\n\nHowever, I shall not give a helping hand to establish a liquor distillery in\nmy country. The young men, who are ready to offer their services for their\ncountry\'s cause, must not fall into this habit of getting intoxicated. The\npeople who want to exact work by drugging methods set more value on the\nexcitement than on the minds they intoxicate.\n\nI had to tell Sandip, in Bimala\'s presence, that he must go. Perhaps both will\nimpute to me the wrong motive. But I must free myself also from all fear of\nbeing misunderstood. Let even Bimala misunderstand me ...\n\nA number of Mahomedan preachers are being sent over from Dacca. The Mussulmans\nin my territory had come to have almost as much of an aversion to the killing\nof cows as the Hindus. But now cases of cow-killing are cropping up here and\nthere. I had the news first from some of my Mussulman tenants with expressions\nof their disapproval. Here was a situation which I could see would be\ndifficult to meet. At the bottom was a pretence of fanaticism, which would\ncease to be a pretence if obstructed. That is just where the ingenuity of the\nmove came in!\n\nI sent for some of my principal Hindu tenants and tried to get them to see the\nmatter in its proper light. "We can be staunch in our own convictions," I\nsaid, "but we have no control over those of others. For all that many of us\nare Vaishnavas, those of us who are Shaktas go on with their animal sacrifices\njust the same. That cannot be helped. We must, in the same way, let the\nMussulmans do as they think best. So please refrain from all disturbance."\n\n"Maharaja," they replied, "these outrages have been unknown for so long."\n\n"That was so," I said, "because such was their spontaneous desire. Let us\nbehave in such a way that the same may become true, over again. But a breach\nof the peace is not the way to bring this about."\n\n"No, Maharaja," they insisted, "those good old days are gone. This will never\nstop unless you put it down with a strong hand."\n\n"Oppression," I replied, "will not only not prevent cow-killing, it may lead\nto the killing of men as well."\n\nOne of them had had an English education. He had learnt to repeat the phrases\nof the day. "It is not only a question of orthodoxy," he argued. "Our country\nis mainly agricultural, and cows are ..."\n\n"Buffaloes in this country," I interrupted, "likewise give milk and are used\nfor ploughing. And therefore, so long as we dance frantic dances on our temple\npavements, smeared with their blood, their severed heads carried on our\nshoulders, religion will only laugh at us if we quarrel with Mussulmans in her\nname, and nothing but the quarrel itself will remain true. If the cow alone is\nto be held sacred from slaughter, and not the buffalo, then that is bigotry,\nnot religion."\n\n"But are you not aware, sir, of what is behind all this?" pursued the English-\nknowing tenant. "This has only become possible because the Mussulman is\nassured of safety, even if he breaks the law. Have you not heard of the Pachur\ncase?"\n\n"Why is it possible," I asked, "to use the Mussulmans thus, as tools against\nus? Is it not because we have fashioned them into such with our own\nintolerance? That is how Providence punishes us. Our accumulated sins are\nbeing visited on our own heads."\n\n"Oh, well, if that be so, let them be visited on us. But we shall have our\nrevenge. We have undermined what was the greatest strength of the authorities,\ntheir devotion to their own laws. Once they were truly kings, dispensing\njustice; now they themselves will become law-breakers, and so no better than\nrobbers. This may not go down to history, but we shall carry it in our hearts\nfor all time ..."\n\nThe evil reports about me which are spreading from paper to paper are making\nme notorious. News comes that my effigy has been burnt at the river-side\nburning-ground of the Chakravartis, with due ceremony and enthusiasm; and\nother insults are in contemplation. The trouble was that they had come to ask\nme to take shares in a Cotton Mill they wanted to start. I had to tell them\nthat I did not so much mind the loss of my own money, but I would not be a\nparty to causing a loss to so many poor shareholders.\n\n"Are we to understand, Maharaja," said my visitors, "that the prosperity of\nthe country does not interest you?"\n\n"Industry may lead to the country\'s prosperity," I explained, "but a mere\ndesire for its prosperity will not make for success in industry. Even when our\nheads were cool, our industries did not flourish. Why should we suppose that\nthey will do so just because we have become frantic?"\n\n"Why not say plainly that you will not risk your money?"\n\n"I will put in my money when I see that it is industry which prompts you. But,\nbecause you have lighted a fire, it does not follow that you have the food to\ncook over it."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII](hw39.htm)\n\n'
