It is to be accomplished, Badaraya _n_ a holds, on account of scriptural\nstatement of equality.\n\nBadaraya _n_ a is of opinion that, in the same way as the condition of\nhouseholdership, those other conditions of life also are obligatory; since in\nthe section beginning 'there are three branches of sacred duty' all the three\nconditions of life are equally referred to, with a view to glorifying him who\nis firmly grounded in Brahman. The reference there made to the condition of\nthe householder necessarily presupposes that condition to be already\nestablished and\n\np. 695\n\nobligatory, and the same reasoning then holds good with regard to the other\nconditions mentioned. Nor must it be said that the special duties mentioned at\nthe beginning of the section--sacrifice, study, charity, austerity, Brahma _k_\narya--all of them belong to the state of the householder (in which case the\ntext would contain no reference to the other conditions of life); for on that\nsupposition the definite reference to a threefold division of duties,\n'Sacrifice, &c. are the first, austerity the second, Brahma _k_ arya the\nthird,' would be unmeaning. The proper explanation is to take the words '\nsacrifice, study, and charity' as descriptive of the condition of the\nhouseholder; the word 'austerity' as descriptive of the duties of the\nVaikhanasa and the wandering mendicant, who both practise mortification; and\nthe word 'Brahma _k_ arya' as referring to the duties of the Brahma _k_ arin.\nThe term 'Brahmasa _m_ stha' finally, in the concluding clause, refers to all\nthe three conditions of life, as men belonging to all those conditions may be\nfounded on Brahman. Those, the text means to say, who are destitute of this\nfoundation on Brahman and only perform the special duties of their condition\nof life, obtain the worlds of the blessed; while he only who at the same time\nfounds himself on Brahman attains to immortality.--In the text 'and those who\nin the forest,' &c. the mention made of the forest shows that the statement as\nto the path of the gods has for its presupposition the fact that that stage of\nlife which is especially connected with the fotest is one generally\nrecognised.--So far it has been shown that the other stages of life are no\nless obligatory than that of the householder, whether we take the text under\ndiscussion as containing merely a reference to those stages (as established by\nindependent means of proof) or as directly enjoining them. The next Sutra is\nmeant to show that the latter view is after all the right one.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 20. Or an injunction, as in the case of the carrying](sbe48467.htm)\n\n"
