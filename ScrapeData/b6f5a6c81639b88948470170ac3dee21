The \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas seem to have been from\nthe beginning the proper repositories of the ancient Upanishads, though it is\ndifficult at first sight to find out in what relation the Upanishads stood to\nthe \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas. The \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas are to be read and studied, not in the\nvillage (grame), but in the forest, and so are the Upanishads. But the\nsubjects treated in the Upanishads belong to a very different order from those\ntreated in the other portions of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas, the former being\nphilosophical, the latter liturgical.\n\nThe liturgical chapters of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas might quite as well have formed\npart of the Brahma _n_ as, and but for the restriction that they are to be\nread in the forest, it is difficult to distinguish between them and the Brahma\n_n_ as. The\n\np. xcii\n\nfirst chapter of the Aitareya-ara _n_ yaka is a mere continuation of the\nAitareya-brahma _n_ a, and gives the description of the Mahavrata, the last\nday but one of the Gavamayana, a sattra or sacrifice which is supposed to last\na whole year. The duties which are to be performed by the Hot _ri_ priests are\ndescribed in the Aitareya-ara _n_ yaka; not all, however, but those only which\nare peculiar to the Mahavrata day. The general rules for the performance of\nthe Mahavrata are to be taken over from other sacrifices, such as the Vi _s_\nva _g_ it, Katurvi _m_ sa, &c., which form the type (prak _ri_ ti) of the\nMahavrata. Thus the two _s_ astras or recitations, called agya-prauga, are\ntaken over from the Vi _s_ va _g_ it, the _s_ astras of the Hotrakas from the\nKaturvi _m_ _s_ a. The Mahavrata is treated here as belonging to the\nGavamayana sattra, which is described in a different _S_ akha, see Taittiriya\nSa _m_ hita VII, 5, 8, and partly in other Vedas. It is the day preceding the\nudayaniya, the last day of the sattra. It can be celebrated, however, by\nitself also, as an ekaha or ahina sacrifice, and in the latter case it is the\ntenth day of the Ekada _s_ aratra (eleven nights sacrifice) called Pu _n_ _d_\narika.\n\nSayana does not hesitate to speak of the Aitareya-\xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka as a part of\nthe Brahma _n_ a 1; and a still earlier authority, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, by calling the\nAitareya-upanishad by the name of Bahvrika-brahma _n_ a-upanishad 2, seems to\nimply that both the Upanishad and the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka may be classed as Brahma\n_n_ a.\n\nThe Aitareya-\xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka appears at first sight a miscellaneous work,\nconsisting of liturgical treatises in the first, fourth, and fifth \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyakas, and of three Upanishads, in the second and third \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas. This,\nhowever, is not the case. The first \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka is purely liturgical, giving\na description of the Mahavrata, so far as it concerns the Hot _ri_ priest. It\nis written in the ordinary Brahma _n_ a style. Then follows the first\nUpanishad, \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka II, 1-3, showing\n\np. xciii\n\nhow certain portions of the Mahavrata, as described in the first \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka,\ncan be made to suggest a deeper meaning, and ought to lead the mind of the\nsacrificer away from the purely outward ceremonial to meditation on higher\nsubjects. Without a knowledge of the first \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka therefore the first\nUpanishad would be almost unintelligible, and though its translation was\nextremely tedious, it could not well have been omitted.\n\nThe second and third Upanishads are not connected with the ceremonial of the\nMahavrata, but in the fourth and fifth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas the Mahavrata forms again\nthe principal subject, treated, however, not as before in the style of the\nBrahma _n_ as, but in the style of Sutras. The fourth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka contains\nnothing but a list of the Mahanamni hymns 1, but the fifth describes the\nMahavrata again, so that if the first \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka may be looked upon as a\nportion of the Aitareya-brahma _n_ as, the fifth could best be classed with\nthe Sutras of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana.\n\nTo a certain extent this fact, the composite character of the Aitareya-\xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka, is recognised even by native scholars, who generally do not trouble\nthemselves much on such questions. They look both on the Aitareya-brahma _n_ a\nand on the greater portion of Aitareya-\xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka as the works of an\ninspired Rishi, Mahidasa Aitareya 2, but they consider the fourth and fifth\nbooks of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka as contributed by purely human authors, such as \xc3\x82\n_s_ valayana and Saunaka, who, like other Sutrakaras, took in verses belonging\nto other _S_ akhas, and did not confine their rules to their own _S_ akha\nonly.\n\nThere are many legends about Mahidasa, the reputed author of the Aitareya-\nbrahma _n_ a and \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. He is\n\np. xciv\n\nquoted several times as Mahidasa Aitareya in the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka itself, though\nnot in the Brahma _n_ a. We also meet his name in the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad\n(III, 16, 7), where we are told that he lived to an age of 116 years 1. All\nthis, however, would only prove that, at the time of the composition or\ncollection of these \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas and Upanishads, a sage was known of the name\nof Mahidasa Aitareya, descended possibly from Itara or Itara. and that one\ntext of the Brahma _n_ as and the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas of the Bahvrikas was handed\ndown in the family of the Aitareyins.\n\nNot content with this apparently very obvious explanation, later theologians\ntried to discover their own reasons for the name of Aitareya. Thus Sayana, in\nhis introduction to the Aitareya-brahma _n_ a 2, tells us that there was once\na Rishi who had many wives. One of them was called Itara, and she had a son\ncalled Mahidasa. His father preferred the sons of his other wives to Mahidasa,\nand once he insulted him in the sacrificial hall, by placing his other sons on\nhis lap, but not Mahidasa. Mahidasa's mother, seeing her son with tears in his\neyes, prayed to her tutelary goddess, the Earth (sviyakuladevata Bhumi _h_ ),\nand the goddess in her heavenly form appeared in the midst of the assembly,\nplaced Mahidasa on a throne, and on account of his learning, gave him the gift\nof knowing the Brahma _n_ a, consisting of forty adhyayas, and, as Sayana\ncalls it, another Brahma _n_ a, 'treating of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka duties' (ara _n_\nyakavratarupam brahma _n_ am).\n\nWithout attaching much value to the legend of Itara, we see at all events that\nSayana considered what we call the Aitareyara _n_ yaka as a kind of Brahma _n_\na, not however the whole of it, but only the first, second, and third \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyakas (atha mahavratam ityadikam a _k_ arya a _k_ arya ityantam). How easy it\nwas for Hindu theologians to invent such legends we see from another account\nof Mahidasa, given by \xc3\x82nandatirtha in his notes on the Aitareya-upanishad.\n\np. xcv\n\n[paragraph continues] He, as Colebrooke was the first to point out, takes\nMahidasa 'to be an incarnation of Naraya _n_ a, proceeding from Vi _s_ ala,\nson of Ab _g_ a,' and he adds, that on the sudden appearance of this deity at\na solemn celebration, the whole assembly of gods and priests (suraviprasa\xe1\xb9\x85gha)\nfainted, but at the intercession of Brahma, they were revived, and after\nmaking their obeisance, they were instructed in holy science. This avatara was\ncalled Mahidasa, because those venerable personages (mahin) declared\nthemselves to be his slaves (dasa) 1.\n\nIn order properly to understand this legend, we must remember that\n\xc3\x82nandatirtha, or rather Vi _s_ ve _s_ varatirtha, whose commentary he\nexplains, treated the whole of the Mahaitareya-upanishad from a Vaish _n_ ava\npoint of view, and that his object was to identify Mahidasa with Narayana. He\ntherefore represents Narayana or Hari as the avatara of Visala, the son of\nBrahman (ab _g_ asuta), who appeared at a sacrifice, as described before, who\nreceived then and there the name of Mahidasa (or Mahidasa), and who taught\nthis Upanishad. Any other person besides Mahidasa would have been identified\nwith the same ease by Vi _s_ ve _s_ varatirtha with Vish _n_ u or Bhagavat.\n\nA third legend has been made up out of these two by European scholars who\nrepresent Mahidasa as the son of Vi _s_ ala and Itara, two persons who\nprobably never met before, for even the Vaish _n_ ava commentator does not\nattempt to take liberties with the name of Aitareya, but simply states that\nthe Upanishad was called Aitareyi, from Aitareya.\n\nLeaving these legends for what they are worth, we may at all events retain the\nfact that, whoever was the author of the Aitareya-brahma _n_ a and the first\nthree books of the Aitareya-\xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, was not the author of the two\nconcluding \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas. And this is confirmed in different ways. Sayana,\nwhen quoting in his commentary on the Rig-veda from the last books, constantly\ncalls it a Sutra of _S_ aunaka, while the fourth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka is specially\nascribed\n\np. xcvi\n\nto \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, the pupil and successor of Saunaka 1. These two names of\n_S_ aunaka and \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana are frequently intermixed. If, however, in\ncertain MSS. the whole of the Aitareya-ara _n_ yaka is sometimes ascribed\neither to \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana or _S_ aunaka, this is more probably due to the\ncolophon of the fourth and fifth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas having been mistaken for the\ntitle of the whole work than to the fact that such MSS. represent the text of\nthe \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, as adopted by the school of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana.\n\nThe Aitareya-ara _n_ yaka consists of the following five \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas:\n\nThe first \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka has five Adhyayas:\n\n1\\. First Adhyaya, Atha mahavratam, has four Kha _n_ _d_ as, 1-4.  \n2\\. Second Adhyaya, \xc3\x82 tva ratham, has four Kha _n_ _d_ as, 5-8.  \n3\\. Third Adhyaya, Hi\xe1\xb9\x85kare _n_ a, has eight 2 Kha _n_ _d_ as, 9-16.  \n4\\. Fourth Adhyaya, Atha sudadoha _h_ , has three Kha _n_ _d_ as, 17-19.  \n5\\. Fifth Adhyaya, Va _s_ a _m_ sa _m_ sati, has three Kha _n_ _d_ as, 20-22.\n\nThe second \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka has seven Adhyayas:\n\n6\\. First Adhyaya, Esha pantha _h_ , has eight Kha _n_ _d_ as, 1-8.  \n7\\. Second Adhyaya, Esha ima _m_ lokam, has four Kha _n_ _d_ as, 9-12.  \n8\\. Third Adhyaya, Yo ha va atmanam, has eight (not three) Kha _n_ _d_ as,\n13-20.  \n9\\. Fourth Adhyaya, \xc3\x82tma va idam, has three Kha _n_ _d_ as, 21-23.  \n10\\. Fifth Adhyaya, Purushe ha va, has one Kha _n_ _d_ a, 24  \n11\\. Sixth Adhyaya, Ko 'yam atmeti, has one Kha _n_ _d_ a, 25.  \n12\\. Seventh Adhyaya, Va\xe1\xb9\x85 me manasi, has one Kha _n_ _d_ a, 26.\n\nThe third \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka has two Adhyayas:\n\n13\\. First Adhyaya, Athata _h_ sa _m_ hitaya upanishat, has six Kha _n_ _d_\nas, 1-6.  \n14\\. Second Adhyaya, Pra _n_ o va _m_ sa iti sthavira _h_ _S_ akalya _h_ , has\nsix Kha _n_ _d_ as, 7-12.\n\nThe fourth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, has one Adhyaya:\n\n15\\. First Adhyaya, Vida maghavan, has one Kha _n_ _d_ a (the Mahanamni's).\n\nThe fifth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka has three Adhyayas:\n\n16\\. First Adhyaya, Mahavratasya pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ avi _m_ satim, has six Kha _n_ _d_\nas, 1-6.  \n17\\. Second Adhyaya, (Griva _h_ )Yasyedam, has five Kha _n_ _d_ as, 7-11.  \n18\\. Third Adhyaya, (\xc3\x9bru) Indragni, has four Kha _n_ _d_ as, 11-14\n\n(9-11 are labelled Aitareya-upanishad and 6-14 are labelled Bahv _ri_ _k_\na-upanishad by vertical brackets in the original)\n\np. xcvii\n\nWith regard to the Upanishad, we must distinguish between the Aitareya-\nupanishad, properly so-called, which fills the fourth, fifth, and sixth\nadhyayas of the second \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, and the Mahaitareya-upanishad 1, also\ncalled by a more general name Bahv _ri_ _k_ a-upanishad, which comprises the\nwhole of the second and third \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas.\n\nThe Persian translator seems to have confined himself to the second \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka 2, to which he gives various titles, Sarbsar, Asarbeh, Antrteheh. That\nAntrteheh  ![](img/i09700.jpg) is a misreading of  ![](img/i09701.jpg) was\npointed out long ago by Burnouf, and the same explanation applies probably to\n![](img/i09702.jpg), asarbeh, and if to that, then to Sarbsar also. No\nexplanation has ever been given why the Aitareya-upanishad should have been\ncalled Sarvasara, which Professor Weber thinks was corrupted into Sarbsar. At\nall events the Aitareya-upanishad is not the Sarvasara-upanishad, the\nOupnek'hat Sarb, more correctly called Sarvopanishatsara, and ascribed either\nto the Taittiriyaka or to the Atharva-veda 3.\n\nThe Aitareya-upanishad, properly so called, has been edited and translated in\nthe Bibliotheca Indica by Dr. Roer. The whole of the Aitareya-ara _n_ yaka\nwith Sayana's commentary was published in the same series by Rajendralal\nMitra.\n\nThough I have had several MSS. of the text and commentary at my disposal, I\nhave derived little aid from them, but have throughout endeavoured to restore\nthat text which _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara (the pupil of Govinda) and Sayana had before them.\nSayana, for the Upanishad portion, follows _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's commentary, of which\nwe have a gloss by \xc3\x82nandag\xc3\xb1ana.\n\nColebrooke in his Essays (vol. ii, p. 42) says that he\n\np. xcviii\n\npossessed one gloss by Naraya _n_ endra on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's commentary, and\nanother by \xc3\x82nandatirtha on a different gloss for the entire Upanishad. The\ngloss by Naraya _n_ endra 1, however, is, so Dr. Rost informs me, the same as\nthat of \xc3\x82nanda _g_ \xc3\xb1ana, while, so far as I can see, the gloss contained in\nMS. E. I. H. 2386 (also MS. Wilson 401), to which Colebrooke refers, is not a\ngloss by \xc3\x82nandatirtha at all, but a gloss by Visvesvaratirtha on a commentary\nby \xc3\x82nandatirthabhagavatpada _k_ arya, also called Pur _n_ apra _g_ \xc3\xb1akarya,\nwho explained the whole of the Mahaitareya-upanishad from a Vaish _n_ ava\npoint of view.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xcii:1](sbe01019.htm#fr_54) Aitareyabrahma _n_ e 'sti ka _n_ _d_ am ara _n_\nyakabhidham (introduction), a remark which he repeats in the fifth \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka.
