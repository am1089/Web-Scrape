Where the getting rid (of good and evil) is mentioned (the obtaining of\nthis good and evil by others has to be added) because the statement about the\nobtaining is supplementary (to the statement about the getting rid of), as in\nthe case of the ku _s_ as, the metres, the praise and the singing. This (i.e.\nthe reason for this) has been stated (in the Purva Mima _m_ sa).\n\nIn the text of the Ta _n_ _d_ ins we meet with the following passage: 'Shaking\noff all evil as a horse shakes his hair, and shaking off the body as the moon\nfrees herself from the mouth of Rahu, I obtain self made and satisfied the\nuncreated world of Brahman' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 13). Again, in the text of the\n\xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas, we read, 'Then knowing, shaking off good and evil he reaches\nthe highest oneness, free from passion' (Mu. Up. III. 1, 3). The Sa _t_\nyayanins read, 'His sons obtain his inheritance, his friends the good, his\nenemies the evil he has done.' And the Kaushitakins, 'He shakes off his good\nand his evil deeds. His beloved relatives obtain the good, his unbeloved\nrelatives the evil he has done' (Kau. Up. I, 4).--Of these texts two state\nthat the man who has reached true knowledge rids himself of his good and evil\ndeeds; one, that his friends and enemies obtain his good and evil deeds\nrespectively; and one finally declares that both things take place.\n\np. 226\n\nThis latter text calls for no remark; nor again that one which refers only to\nhis friends and enemies obtaining his good and evil deeds; for in order that\nthey may obtain those he must necessarily first have got rid of them, and the\nact of getting rid of them has therefore to be supplied in the text. Those\npassages, however, which merely mention a man's shaking off his deeds, give\nrise to a discussion whether those deeds, when shaken off, are obtained by his\nfriends and enemies, or not. Here the purvapakshin maintains that the latter\ncircumstance is not to be supplied in the two passages mentioned--firstly\nbecause the text does not state it; secondly because what other _S_ akhas say\nabout it falls within the sphere of a different vidya; and thirdly because the\ngetting rid of the evil and good deeds is something done by the man himself,\nwhile the obtaining of them is the work of others. As thus there is no\nnecessary connexion between the two, we have no right to supply the latter on\nthe basis of the former.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. Although the text mentions only the\ngetting rid of the deeds, yet the obtaining of them by others must necessarily\nbe added, because the statement concerning the latter is merely supplementary\nto the statement about the former, as appears from the text of the\nKaushitakins.--In reply to the arguments brought forward by the purvapakshin\nwe offer the following remarks.\n\nThe separation of the different passages would indeed have to be insisted\nupon, if anybody intended to introduce an injunction about something to be\ndone, which is contained in one text only, into some other text also. But in\nthe passages under discussion the act of getting rid of--and the act of\nobtaining--the good and evil deeds are not mentioned as something to be\nperformed, but merely as implying a glorification of knowledge; the intended\nsense being, 'Glorious indeed is that knowledge through whose power the good\nand evil deeds, the causes of the sa _m_ sara, are shaken off by him who\nknows, and are transferred to his friends and enemies.' The passage thus being\nglorificatory only, the teacher is of opinion that,\n\np. 227\n\nto the end of strengthening the glorification, the obtaining of the good and\nevil deeds by the friends and enemies--which in some passages is represented\nas the consequence of their being shaken off by the man who knows--must be\nsupplied in those passages also which mention only the shaking off. That one\narthavada-passage often depends on another arthavada-passage is a well-known\nfact; the following passage, e.g. 'The twenty-first indeed from this world is\nthat sun,' would be unintelligible if no regard were paid to the other\npassage, 'Twelve are the months, five the seasons, three these worlds; that\nsun is the twenty-first.' Similarly the passage, 'The two Trish _t_ ubh verses\nare for strengthening,' necessarily requires to be taken in connexion with the\nother passage, 'Strength of the senses indeed is Trish _t_ ubh.' And as the\nstatement about the obtaining of the good and evil deeds has only the purpose\nof glorifying knowledge (and is not made on its own account), we need not\ninsist too much on the question how the results of actions done by one man can\nbe obtained by others. That the obtaining of the deeds by others is connected\nwith their being got rid of by the man who knows, merely for the purpose of\nglorifying knowledge, the Sutrakara moreover indicates by making use of the\nexpression, 'because the statement about obtaining is supplementary to,' &c.;\nfor if he wished to intimate that the actual circumstance of other persons\nobtaining a man's good and evil deeds is to be inserted in those vidyas where\nit is not mentioned he would say, 'because the fact of obtaining.' &c. The\nSutra therefore, availing itself of the opportunity offered by the discussion\nof the combination of particular qualities, shows how mere glorificatory\npassages have to be inserted in texts where they are wanting.\n\nThe remaining part of the Sutra, 'Like the ku _s_ as the metres, the praise\nand the singing, 'introduces some analogous instances.--The case under\ndiscussion is analogous to the case of the ku _s_ as 1. Those, a mantra of the\nBhallavins\n\np. 228\n\n[paragraph continues] ('You ku _s_ as are the children of the tree, do you\nprotect me!') represents as coming from trees in general, without any\nspecification. The corresponding mantra of the Sa _t_ yayanins on the other\nhand is, 'You ku _s_ as are the children of the Udumbara-tree;' a\nparticularizing statement which must be considered as valid for the ku _s_ as\nin general.--Another analogous case is that of the metres. In some places no\nspecial statement is made about their order of succession; but the text of the\nPai\xe1\xb9\x85gins, 'The metres of the Devas come first,' determines the general\npriority of the metres of the Devas to those of the Asuras 1.--Similarly the\ntime of the stotra accompanying the performance of the Sho _d_ a _s_ in-rite\nwhich in some texts is left undefined is settled by the text of the _Ri_\ng-vedins (ar _k_ a _h_ ), 'when the Sun has half risen.'--And similarly a\nparticularizing text of the Bhallavins defines what priests have to join in\nthe singing; a point left unsettled in other _S_ rutis 2.--As in these\nparallel cases, so we have to proceed in the case under discussion also. For\nif we refused to define a general text by another more particular one, we\nshould be driven to assume optional procedure (vikalpa), and that the latter\nis if possible to be avoided is a well-known principle. This is stated in the\nPurva Mima _m_ sa-sutras X, 8, 15.\n\nThe passages about the shaking (off) can be viewed as giving rise to a\ndifferent discussion also, and the Sutra can accordingly be explained in a\ndifferent manner. The question can be raised whether the 'shaking' means the\ngetting rid of one's good and evil deeds or something else.--The purvapaksha\nwill in that case have to be established in the following manner. Shaking\n(dhu) here does not mean 'getting rid of,' since the root 'dhu' according to\ngrammar means shaking in an intransitive sense or trembling; of flags\nstreaming in the wind we say, for\n\np. 229\n\ninstance, 'the flags are shaking' (dodhuyante). We therefore take the word in\nthe same sense in the passages under discussion and understand by the\n'trembling' of the good and evil deeds the fact of their not meeting, for a\ncertain time, with their results.\n\nTo this purvapaksha we make the following reply. The word 'shaking' has to be\ntaken in the sense of 'getting rid of,' because it is supplemented by the\nstatement of others obtaining the good and evil deeds. For those deeds cannot\nbe obtained by others unless they are got rid of by their former owner. Hence\nalthough it is not easily imaginable that the deeds got rid of by one man\nshould be obtained by others, we yet, on the ground of its being mentioned,\nmay determine accordingly that 'shaking' means 'getting rid of.' And although\nonly in some passages the statement about the obtaining is actually found in\nproximity to the statement about the shaking, it yet has, on the ground of the\nlatter, to be supplied everywhere and thus becomes a general reason of\ndecision (viz. that 'shaking' means 'getting rid of). Against the\npurvapakshin's view we further remark that good and evil deeds cannot be said\nto 'tremble' in the literal sense of the word, like flags in the wind, since\nthey are not of substantial nature.--(Nor must it be said that of the horse\nwhich exemplifies the shaking, the text only says that it shakes its hair, not\nthat it casts anything off, for) the horse when shaking itself shakes off dust\nand also old hairs. And with that shaking (which at the same time is a shaking\noff) the text expressly compares the shaking (off) of evil.--Nor do we when\nassigning different meanings to one and the same root enter thereby into\nconflict with Sm _ri_ ti (grammar). The clause 'this has been stated' we have\nalready explained.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[227:1](sbe38169.htm#fr_147) I.e. according to the commentators, small wooden\nrods used by the Udgat _ri_ s in counting the stotras.\n\n[228:1](sbe38169.htm#fr_148) Metres of less than ten syllables belong to the\nAsuras, those of ten and more to the Devas.\n\n[228:2](sbe38169.htm#fr_149) The general text is, according to the\ncommentators, 'The priests join in the singing;' the defining text of the\nBhallavins, 'The adhvaryu does not join in the singing.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 27](sbe38170.htm)\n\n"
