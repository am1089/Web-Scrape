But all the same he (who is desirous of knowledge) must be possessed of\ncalmness, subjection of the senses, &c., since those (states) are enjoined as\nauxiliaries to that (viz. knowledge), and must (on that account) necessarily\nbe accomplished.\n\np. 308\n\nPerhaps somebody might think that we have no right to look upon sacrifices and\nthe like as means of knowledge because there is no injunction to that effect.\nFor a passage like 'By sacrifice they seek to know' is of the nature of an\nanuvada, and therefore does not aim at enjoining sacrifices but rather at\nglorifying knowledge,' so glorious is knowledge that they seek to obtain it\nthrough sacrifices and the like.'\n\nBut even should this be so the seeker for knowledge must possess calmness of\nmind, must subdue his senses and so on; for all this is enjoined as a means of\nknowledge in the following scriptural passage, 'Therefore he who knows this,\nhaving become calm, subdued, satisfied, patient, and collected, sees self in\nSelf (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 23). And what is enjoined must necessarily be carried\nout.--But in the above passage also we observe only a statement as to\nsomething actually going on--'Having become calm, &c,, he sees,' not an\ninjunction!--Not so, we reply. The introductory word 'therefore' which\nexpresses praise of the subject under discussion makes us understand that the\npassage has an injunctive character 1.\n\nMoreover the text of the Madhyandinas directly reads 'let him see' (not 'he\nsees'). Hence calmness of mind and so on are required even if sacrifices, &c.,\nshould not be required.--Sacrifices and so on, however, are required likewise,\nbecause (as said in Sutra 26) scripture teaches them.--But it has been said\nthat in the passage,' Him they seek to know by sacrifices,' no injunction is\nobserved!--True; but nevertheless we must assume the passage to be an\ninjunction, because the connexion of the search for knowledge with sacrifices\nand so on is something new; i.e. is not established by another text, and\ntherefore the\n\np. 309\n\npassage under discussion cannot be an anuvada referring to it. The case is\nanalogous to that of passages such as 'therefore Pushan\n[1](sbe38237.htm#fn_197) receives a well-crushed share of food, for he is\ntoothless.' There also no injunction is directly stated; but as the matter of\nthe passage is new we assume an injunction and understand that the grains for\nPushan are to be crushed at all vik _ri_ tis of the dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa; as\nwas explained in the Purva Mima _m_ sa.\n\nAn analogous conclusion was arrived at under Sutra 20.--Sm _ri_ tis also such\nas the Bhagavadgita explain that sacrifices and the like if undertaken without\na view to their special results become for him who is desirous of final\nrelease a means of knowledge. Hence sacrifices and the like, on the one hand,\nand calmness of mind and so on, on the other hand, according to the a _s_\nramas, i.e. all works enjoined on the a _s_ ramas must be had regard to with a\nview to the springing up of knowledge. Calmness of mind, &c., are, on account\nof the expression 'he who knows this' connecting them with knowledge, to be\nviewed as approximate--direct--means of knowledge, while sacrifices and so on\nwhich scripture connects with the search of knowledge are to be looked upon as\nremote--indirect--means.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[308:1](sbe38236.htm#fr_196) For if there were no injunction, the praise would\nbe without meaning. The 'therefore' connects the passage with the preceding\nclause, 'he is not sullied by any evil deed.' The sense then is, 'Because he\nwho knows the Self as described before is not sullied by any evil deed,\ntherefore let him, after having become calm, &c., see the Self, and so on.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 28](sbe38237.htm)\n\n"
