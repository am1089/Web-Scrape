When he returned some time later, there was\na decided change in his mood. It had been his custom to rise early in the\nmorning and follow the daily ceremonies of his religion, but now instead of\npracticing his usual habits of worship, he sat in the Padma posture and\nassumed an indifferent attitude to all things.\n\nRaja Rishi Viswamitra arrived at the King\'s palace (Ram\'s father\'s place). The\nKing saluted the Raja Rishi and paid him great respect. He then bestowed\ngreater marks of honor upon him, by saying: "By thy visit all my sins, misery\n\np. 12\n\nand unhappiness have been removed. Tell me, what is thy need?"\n\nTherefore, Raja Rishi said: "O King of Kings, true to your Master, Rishi\nVashisht, an embodiment (in the cause) of justice, I came seeking the services\nof your son, Ram. I cannot bear the injustice forced upon me by the Rakshasan,\nfor they do not permit me to do any good work."\n\nThe King answered him thus: "My son is indeed very young and is not trained in\nthe art of fighting. He does not seem to be himself at this time and has\nbecome indifferent to the world. Life would become bitter and unhappy, to me\nand my family, should anything happen to my son, Ram. Therefore, in his stead,\nI will go with thee, and with my army I shall meet the Rakshasan in battle."\n\nRaja Rishi Viswamitra with great anger said: "Tell me truthfully and without\nfaltering, if you, the King, will perform such beastly acts of deception, who\nwill keep his word? I shall go back from where I came to endure (or submit to)\nthe injustice of the Rakshasan. You may live happily with your son and\nothers."\n\nThe Rishi Vashisht said: "O King of Kings, keep thy word, for thy sacred duty\nis to protect\n\np. 13\n\nthy subjects, and let there be no injustice at any price. Thy son will be safe\nwith the Rishi Viswamitra. Thy son is impassive and unconcerned toward worldly\nthings, and his association with this Great Raja Rishi will be a great\nenlightenment to him. Send him forth and do not reveal the knowledge of his\ndeparture to his brothers. His indifferent state of mind, toward the world and\nlife, is not the result of disappointment in his desires, but is a longing for\nliberation, which is a stepping-stone toward self-realization. When all the\ndelusions have been removed from his mind, he will attain the highest Brahmic\nstate and will then perform his daily duties, as we are now doing."\n\nRam came and paid his respect to all. Although his father, the King, tried to\npersuade him to sit on the throne with him, he refused and sat quietly among\nthe crowd.\n\nRaja Rishi Viswamitra then said to Ram: "O Brave Enemy of Sensual Objects, why\nart thou drowning thyself in the Ocean of Delusion, which is only fit for the\nAjnani (ignorant)? If thou wilt tell us the cause of thy suffering, then thou\nshalt be relieved of it; thou wilt then be able to attain that for which thou\nart longing. Therefore,\n\np. 14\n\nI beseech thee to speak to us the truth."\n\nRam answered:\n\n"O Great Rishi, embodiment of Grace, thou hast allowed me to tell the cause of\nmy suffering, and I beseech thee to please listen to my story. I was born in\nmy father\'s home (the King\'s palace), studied and attained an education and\ngained much knowledge. I have journeyed around the earth visiting all Holy and\nSacred places. When I returned from this pilgrimage, I found that my desires\nfor this Universe had ceased; that life was full of delusion, without an iota\nof bliss within it. This world is illusion from birth to death, and from death\nto birth. The worldly things are nothing except seeds of all unhappiness\n(pains). What is wealth or a kingdom? If we are seeking happiness, we find all\nunreal except Atma. When I try to learn what generates all worldly things,\nthen I have no love for any of it. It is like the traveler who, when he has\nlearned of the unreality of the wave of the mirage in the desert, does not\ncrave it. I am trying to set myself free of the sensual fire, but I am burning\nwithin like the old tree which has burned within by heat generated\n\np. 15\n\nby itself. The load of delusion is pressing me down. I cannot bear it longer.\nI have tried to please my relatives, that they may not condemn me for my\ngrief, but I cannot find a way out of it, though I have cried from the house-\ntop.\n\n**The Wealth:**\n\n"Wealth causes the mind of men to roam--seeking joy but bringing dangers. I\nhave not seen anyone whose mind does not melt like snow, at the sight of\nwealth. This wealth not only destroys peace and joy which arises from the\nspiritual wisdom, but it also produces hate, dishonesty, envy, jealousy and\nthe like. All people, whether rich or poor, wise or foolish, peaceful or\nwarlike, bow down to the degrading wealth. It causes people to be unjust,\nalthough it is useless as a flower under the hood of a Cobra.\n\n**The Prana:**\n\n"The Prana (vital force) is like water pouring from a jar: it is going out of\nthe body with the five senses; it is cutting short the lives of the ignorant.\nI am not enjoying this life of mine as my body is unreal. It is easy to\ncontrol the ether, the winds, the waves of the ocean that\n\np. 16\n\nrise and fall, but it is hard to control Prana (vital force). This body is not\npermanent. It is like winter cold and summer heat----it comes and goes. If we\ntry to find its fruits, we only find bitter disappointments and sorrows . The\nlife most worthwhile is that of those who have attained the highest Atmic\nwisdom, blessed with liberation, and freed from sorrows (pains). Life is\nworthwhile only to those who have freed themselves from rebirth. Others are\nonly lives of folly--lives of the foolish. People without the power of\ndiscrimination, find that learning is only a burden to them. The person\nwithout peace of mind, finds that his mind is only a burden to him. The person\nwho is full of passion, finds that the Atmic wisdom is only a burden to him.\nThe person who has not found the blissful joy within himself finds that the\nbody, the mind, the egoism and the actions are only burdens to him. Prana\nstays awhile in the body but often departs when the person is young, like the\nwise who do not stay in the company of the wicked.\n\n**The Egoism:**\n\n"I am terrified by this harmful enemy of\n\np. 17\n\nmine, egoism, which was born by illusion. It is the mother of many dangers.\nThere is no worse danger than that of egoism. I fear this egoism will not\nleave me, as I have had to contend with it for a long time. I do not eat food\nwith water. What is the use to speak of the other enjoyments? Doing anything\nthrough egoism is unreal. The sooner this egoism is given up, the better. As\nlong as we tolerate egoism, just so long are desires created within us. I have\ngiven up all active thoughts that I may be free from egoism, but unhappiness\n(pain) is still clinging to me. I have not realized my own self. May thou, O\nRishi, be kind enough to bless me, that I may liberate myself of this enemy,\negoism, which is the mother of all dangers in the universe. Its home is in the\nmind. It is false in its nature and is without intelligence or discrimination.\n\n**The Mind:**\n\n"My mind is flying to sensual objects, resistless as though drawn by a magnet.\nThis baneful mind does not like the real joy that comes from within, but\ntravels outward (to\n\np. 18\n\nworldly pleasures). It is like a torrent, seething, writhing, uncontrolled,\ndestroying in its onward rush, all the finer sensibilities. As a straw is\ntossed into the air, and a tree is shaken by the wind, so is the action of the\nmind. It lifts me up to the highest realm, then drops me unmercifully to the\nlowest depths of the earth. This terrible state of mind is more dangerous than\na consuming flame. It is possible to dry up the ocean, to root out the\nHimalaya Mountains, or to eat fire, but it is harder, by far, to control the\nmind. It is the creator of all objects. This universe appeared when the mind\ncame into existence, then disappeared with the absence of mind. Hence the mind\nshould be controlled. With the control of mind, all pains and all sorrows will\nperish.\n\n**The Desires:**\n\n"The desires, like owls of the air (anger, passion, etc.), fly into the sky of\nthe Atma. During the night\'s slumber, these restless desires are mingled with\nthe gloom of delusion. All my longing for good works is defeated by my\ndesires. Without spiritual mind, I am caught\n\np. 19\n\nby desires, like a bird in a trap. The fire of my desires is burning me up,\nand I think that even a bath in ambrosia will not cool me. This owl of desires\nstirs up vain hopes within a person to strive for wealth, to attain- joy, or\nlikes an old woman who dances for remuneration, rather than the joy of\ndancing. Likewise, all my desires try to roach for that which is impossible,\nbecause it is within. Desires, like monkeys, roam about without any place in\nview, passing over objects of desire, then longing for them again. It is these\ndesires which bring the disease of re-birth--the worst of all diseases. This\ndisease of desire can reach into well guarded forts. It is such desires as\nthese that make the inner man manifest outwardly, like the rays of sunshine\nwhich cause the lotus buds to burst into blossom. These desires of the mind\nare like a two edged sword or like a red hot iron which consumes the greatest\nof men into nothingness\n\n"The body is made of five elements which vary in form--some lean and others\nfat. It is a house of ill, oscillating between pleasures and pains. What good\ncan be gained through this body, except joys and sorrows? \'It is the house of\negoism. The owner of the house has ten mischievous\n\np. 20\n\nmonkeys (the organs). The servant of this house is the mind which produces\nthoughts. If this body should exist forever, then it would be worthy of the\nlonging, but it will perish at the sight of death. What is this body? "It Is a\ncomposition of blood, tissues, and bones. It is subject to diseases and decay,\nand alike it serves for the poor, and for the rich. He, who believes in the\nillusory as the real, will cling to the body in delusion.\n\n**Childhood:**\n\n"Anyone who is born in the ocean of the universe will keep rolling to and fro\nwith its waves. Childhood is possessed of dangers, helplessness, and is unable\nto express thoughts, ideas, etc.. This stage of life is so filled with fears\nincurred by the parents, relatives, and elders, that none can enjoy it.\n\n**Youth:**\n\n"The fearful and helpless time rolls out to the. next dangerous step as youth,\nwhen he receives hard blows dealt by the devil known as, The\n\np. 21\n\n[paragraph continues] God of Love, whose hiding place is in the mind. The\nbroadening of his view, the achievements of knowledge, the help of the\nteacher, and all good works, could not save the youth when he falls blindly\ninto the pit of the sensual, or is caught by the Hunter known as The God of\nLove. The pleasures of youth increase until he finds that the youthful period\nis over; that he is only a man who has attained Nirvana while in the youthful\nage. Such a man is fit to be worshipped. Is there any period in the life of\nman which is safe from surrounding dangers? Yes, if we find a tree in the sky\nabove.\n\n**The Lusts:**\n\n"There are lusts for women, gold and wine. When man has indulged in any of the\nabove lusts, then his body and mind burns without fuel, so that it produces\nheat. Men are caught through greediness for these lusts, as fish are caught\nwith bait. If the lust for the above ceases, then men are free from all\nworldly bondage, which has its seat in the mind. Without giving up lust there\nis no chance of obtaining the Brahmic state, which is the highest state of\nexistence.\n\np. 22\n\n**The Old Age:**\n\n"The time of childhood is past, the youth is spent, and now the worst time of\nall, that of old age must step into reign. If it arrives in company with\ndisease and sorrow, then the Atma will bid it adieu. Like the love which\nceases for the old wife when the husband finds a new mate, so the Atma gives\nup the old body full of diseases, for the new one. In old age, one suffers\nmore and more as he has no power to gratify his desires. He is helpless to\naccomplish his desires, and quivers with old age while those about are\nlaughing at him. If he happens to possess yellow dust (gold), then his\nchildren and relatives are praying for his death--that his gold may become\ntheirs). Old age, which is beset with dangers and helplessness, is burning\nwithin and has no power to cope with the desires. The longing for various\nlusts will increase with old age but the power to gratify the thirst for more\nwill leave. Day and night the fear of death seizes him from all sides. It is\nmore difficult\n\np. 23\n\nto control the desires in old age, for they have increased with the\nexperiences of life.\n\n**The Time:**\n\n"As all pains arise through ignorance, so is the end of life at the sight of\ndeath, which comes to all. As certain as fish die without water, so sure is\ndeath to the rich and the poor, to the powerful and to the weak. The forest,\nthe mountains, the whole universe will die at its given time, and the whole\nwill be born again after that time (the cycle) is over.\n\nThe Sakti: (Power)\n\n"This destructive Sakti (power) puts an end to all things. It melts this\nuniverse to nothingness and draws the whole to it for a time. There is no one\nwho can withstand its victorious bow and near its arrows, for this great Sakti\n(powers is superior to them all. Its head is the Heaven its feet are the\nHells, its body is the earth, its eyes are the sun and the moon, etc..\nSometimes it takes the form of Rudra (the God of Death), another time it is\nVishnu (one of the Hindu Trinity\n\np. 24\n\nwho Preserve), another time it became Brahma (the Creator), and the **Pralay**\n(at the time this universe melted to water) it took the shape of a terrific\nBhairava (a powerful woman). All these things or objects which I hays\ndescribed, are not real, but have arisen through egoism and the mind. I do not\nknow the object or aim of this birth or the reason of disease of desires\nwithin the heart of every being. It is very hard to find one who has freed\nhimself from the diseases of desires, but a great spiritual enlightenment is\ngained through the contact with such a one. The wise are few and for that\nreason the means of liberation are not known. The mind which is deluded by\nillusion lacks the kindness of heart, has no compassion for good and is\nindifferent to good or bad. When it realizes what is good, then cowardice is\nreplaced by courage; this world by Heaven. It is seldom we meet the blessed\none whose mind is controlled, but we meet the ignorant often. All baneful\nthoughts produce bondage. All desires and egos will leave the body and go to\nthe Heavens or other worlds or planets. All countries will change, all\nmountains become dust, all three worlds will perish, the oceans, the stars,\nthe sun, the people, with\n\np. 25\n\nor without power, the Trinity (Brahma--Creator, Vishnu--Preserver and Rudra--\nDestroyer) will be absorbed up to the highest reality. Brahma who creates by\nHis will and along with its law, comes to an end; all the Akasa (matter) and\nthe Macrocosm merge into the [Paramesuara](errata.htm#0) [i.e., Parameshwara--\nJBH.] (non-dual; the highest God), that which is the liberator from the\ndelusion of illusions . Ono reality, above thought or speech, is the pure\nwisdom. People are always anxious to engage in such thoughts as: "This is the\ntime for good works" "When will be a good time to visit the Holy Places?"\n"Relatives are a great help." "I cannot do as I use to do." "I cannot enjoy\nthe things that I once enjoyed." These people want to follow the Great One,\nbut are too engrossed in home, wife, comforts of life, and obtaining wealth.\nThey are always between the two. When a child is born, they are happy; when\ndeath claims another, they are grieved. Should one succeed in obtaining a\ngreat amount of wealth he is called the King of Riches. But lo! There comes\ndeath who puts an end to all!\n\n"Lead me to the path by which I shall be free from all delusions. Surrounded\nby great danger, the brave hero dies at the hands of a coward.\n\np. 26\n\n[paragraph continues] Hundreds of people die at the mercy of a man. This is\nthe play of Sakti (power). My mind is burned by earthly fire. I have no desire\nfor wealth. I prefer death to the pleasures of life. I prefer to live without\nsorrow and disappointments, but I find it impossible to free my mind. If you,\nwith your well controlled mind, will not remove my grief, then to whom shall I\ngo? The dangers of poison are not poisonous to me, but the sensual objects are\nmy woe. The former kills only the body, but the latter ruins many bodies of\nfuture birth. Free from objects of love or hate, the sages, like thee, with\nquietness of mind are ever engaged in seedless Samadhi (highest meditation).\nMy mind is indifferent toward the material or the spiritual. Please show me\nthe way to bliss that is above pain or pleasure, doubt or delusion. That\neternal state can\'t be reached by the five senses. I desire the path by which\nthe Great Righteous ones manage to escape, from the suffering\'s of this world.\nPlease be kind enough to tell me--is there not a higher state of existence? Is\nthere not a state of quietness? If there is no one who will unlock that door\nfor me, then may I not attain that peaceful state by my own efforts alone? I\nam\n\np. 27\n\nwithout doubt and egoism, I do not care for food, water, nor fine clothes. I\nwill not perform my daily duties. I do not care to read scrildure, nor do I\ncare for pleasures or pains. Above love and hate, I shall always be silent and\ndesireless."\n\nThus Ram ended his story of misery and darkness, and asked for light.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: How the Wise Ought to Live](yvhf04.htm)\n\n'
