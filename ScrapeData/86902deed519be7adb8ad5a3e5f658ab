Vyasa said :-- O King! Then, on hearing his daughter\xc2\x92s words, that high\nsouled king of Benares, Subahu, came to the spot where the kings were staying\nand said :-- \xc2\x93O kings! Now you can go to your own camps; tomorrow I will\nperform my daughter\xc2\x92s marriage ceremony.\n\n\n\n2\\. Let you all be pleased with me and graciously accept the food and drink,\ngiven by me. Tomorrow let you all come here and perform my daughter\xc2\x92s marriage\nceremony.\n\n\n\n3\\. O Kings! My daughter is not coming today to this hall of Svayamvara; what\ncan I do now; I will console her and bring her here tomorrow. Therefore do you\nall go now to your own camps respectively.\n\n\n\n4\\. Intelligent persons should not quarrel with the members of their own\nfamily. But they should always shew kindness towards their own sons and\ndaughters who are under their protection. However, I will make my daughter\nunderstand and bring her tomorrow morning. You may all go now to your places\nas you desire.\n\n\n\n5\\. Tomorrow morning we will settle about the pledge, whether by choice or by\nfulfilling a promise, that requires strength, and have the marriage\ncelebrated; or better you all together would decide what mode of Svayamvara is\nto be adopted.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n6\\. The kings heard Subahu and trusted him. Then seeing that the city is well\nguarded on all sides, they went to their own camps and performed their mid-day\nduties.\n\n\n\n7-8. The king Subahu on this side began to perform all the duties regarding\nthe marriage of his daughter, after duly consulting with all the chief members\nof the family. At the appointed time of marriage he brought his daughter in a\nwell concealed and guarded chamber, had the bathing ceremony of the bridegroom\nelect performed by the priests, versed in the Vedas, and had him well dressed\nand did other requisite things. Then he brought the bridegroom in the house,\nmade him seat on a Vedi (platform) and duly worshipped him.\n\n\n\n9\\. Then the large-hearted king gave to the bridegroom seat, \xc3\x82chamaniya (water\nfor rinsing the mouth and such articles of food as require rinsing one\xc2\x92s mouth\nafter eating them), Arghya (articles for worshipping deservedly, padyam, e.g.,\nwater for washing the feet with an offer of green grass, rice, etc., made in\nworshipping a God or a Brahma _n_ ), the two silken cloths and sheet, cows,\nand two ear-rings and then wanted to give Sudars\xc2\x92ana his daughter.\n\n\n\np. 210\n\n\n\n10\\. The high minded Sudars\xc2\x92ana accepted all the offerings given by the king.\nSeeing this, Manorama was relieved of her anxiety. Manorama began to think\nthat beautiful and well adorned daughter as if the daughter of Kuvera (the God\nof wealth); and thanked herself and thought as if all her duties were over.\n\n\n\n11\\. Then the royal ministers carried gladly and fearlessly the beautiful\nSudars\xc2\x92ana, worshipped with ornaments and clothings, in a good nice carriage\nto the centre of the amusement court.\n\n\n\n12\\. On the other hand, the elderly female members, who knew all about the\nprescribed rules, performed the dressing of the princess in a befitting manner\nand placing her in a beautiful conveyance took her before the bridegroom\nelect, in the marriage hall, where there was the platform regularly built.\n\n\n\n13-14. The Sacred Fire was then lit, the royal priest began to perform the\nHoma ceremony duly; when the amusement ceremony of the bridegroom and bride\nunited in love was duly performed, the priest called them there. After this\nthe bridegroom and bride performed duly the Laja Homa ceremony and\ncircumambulated the Sacred Fire. Thus all the ceremonies, befitting the gotra\nand family, were all fully performed according to the prescribed rules.\n\n\n\n15-17. Then the king Subahu, excited by feelings of love, in the marriage\ntime, gave to the prince Sudars\xc2\x92ana the following presents: well adorned two\nhundred chariots, with horses and the arrow cases filled with arrows, one\nhundred and twenty five elephants, dressed with golden ornaments, looking like\nso many mountains, one hundred beautiful female elephants and one hundred maid\nservants, all dressed in golden ornaments.\n\n\n\n18-20. The king gave the bridegroom also one thousand servants well adorned,\nbearing the complete set of all sorts of weapons, many gems and jewels,\nclothings, nice variegated woolen clothes, beautiful capacious rooms to live\nin, and two thousand excellent horses born in the Sindhu country, three\nhundred good camels able to carry sufficient loads, and two hundred carriages,\nfilled with grains, etc.\n\n\n\n21\\. Then the king bowed to the king\xc2\x92s daughter Manorama and with clasped\nhands, said :-- \xc2\x93O royal daughter! I am now become your servant; now kindly\nsay what is your desire?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n22\\. Hearing these beautiful words of the king, Manorama said :-- \xc2\x93O king! all\ngood to you and let your family increase in sons and grandsons. You have\nincreased my honour by giving in marriage your daughter (jewel) to my son. I\nhave no other desire than to see your welfare constant and the increase in\nyour family, posterity and prosperity.\n\n\n\np. 211\n\n\n\n23\\. O king! Your are the chief amongst the kings. Your have made my son great\nand strong like the Sumeru mountain by giving him your daughter in marriage.\nYou are high and my related. I am not the daughter of a panegyrist or a bard;\nhow can I then praise you for this noble act of yours.\n\n\n\n24-25. O king! Your character is wonderful and pure. What more shall I say to\nyou than this that you all, in the face of many other kings, have given your\ndaughter to my son in marriage, who is banished from his kingdom, is deprived\nof his father and is living in the forest, penniless, armyless, subsisting\nhimself on roots and fruits only.\n\n\n\n26\\. In these cases the kings as a rule make relations with those only, who\nare their equals in rank and position, of noble families of equal grade,\nhaving forces and wealth equal to each other. No other king would have offered\nhis beautiful well-qualified daughter in marriage to my prince who is without\nany wealth.\n\n\n\n27\\. O king! On your this act, all the other kings, holding great influence\nand possessing armies, have turned out your enemies. I, being a woman am\nunable to describe the amount of patience in you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n28\\. The king Subahu of Benares, hearing the sweet words of Manorama was\nhighly pleased and, with folded hands, began to say, \xc2\x93O Devi, you better take\nmy this celebrated kingdom; I will become the commander of your forces and\nwill try my best to guard this city.\n\n\n\n29\\. Or you can take half of my kingdom and remain here with your son. It is\nnot my desire that you leave this Benares and go and live in the forest.\n\n\n\n30-31. The kings have become very offended; I will first try to appease them;\nif they be not satisfied, I will adopt the means of \xc2\x93gift\xc2\x94 or sowing\ndissensions amongst them; and even, if, in that, I fail, I will ultimately\ntake to war. O Devi! Victory or defeat is under the hands of the Destiny;\nstill victory comes to those who are in the right path and defeat to those who\nare in the wrong path. How then can the victor arise to those sinful kings?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n32\\. Hearing the king\xc2\x92s words, pregnant with meaning, Manorama felt herself\nhighly respected; and, with a cheerful heart, said the following good words.\n\n\n\n33\\. \xc2\x93O king! let all good come on you! you better discard all fear and reign\nwith your sons here; my son Sudars\xc2\x92ana, too, will become the king of Ayodhya\nby the Grace of S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavati Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, the Supreme Cause of the\ninnumerable worlds, and will roam in this world; there is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\np. 212\n\n\n\n34\\. May Bhagavati Bhavani bring all good unto you; now kindly permit us to\ndepart to our homes, O king! I always contemplate the Highest Goddess Ambika;\nand I have no time to indulge in other thoughts.\xc2\x94\n\n35\\. Thus, on various subjects, Manorama and the king Subahu began to talk\nwith each other, causing satisfaction to both like nectar, when the morning\nbroke out.\n\n\n\n36\\. The kings, knowing early in the morning, that the princess had been given\naway in marriage, became very much enraged and went out of the city and began\nto discuss with one another.\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93We will kill today the king Subahu, the disgrace amongst the kings as well\nthat boy Sudars\xc2\x92ana, totally unfit to marry the princess, and take away the\nkingdom and the princess S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala. How can we return to our homes, with this\nsevere disgrace, stamped on our heads.\n\n\n\n37\\. Hear, O kings! the sound of the drums, mridangas, other instruments; the\nsounds of the conchshells have even been overpowered. Hark! The various\nmusical sounds and the chanting of the Vedas. It is then certain that the King\nSubahu has finished the marriage ceremony of his daughter S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala with\nSudars\xc2\x92ana.\n\n\n\n38\\. Oh! This king has deceived us with his words and performed the marriage\nceremony, according to ordinary religious rules.\n\n\n\n39\\. Now O kings! decide unanimously what to do and come to a definite\nconclusion.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nWhen the kings were thus discussing, the king of Benares, of indomitable\nprowess, the king Subahu, after finishing his daughter\xc2\x92s marriage, came there\nwith his famous friends to invite them.\n\n\n\n40\\. Seeing the King of Benares present, all the other kings did not utter a\nsingle word, but they remained silent, beaming with anger.\n\n\n\n41\\. Subahu then approached to the kings, bowed down, and, with folded hands,\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93Be kind enough to come to my house for dinner.\n\n42\\. O kings! My daughter S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala after all has selected Sudars\xc2\x92ana; I\ncould not help in this. You are all kind and noble; therefore you all be\npeaceful and let the matter drop.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n43\\. The kings hearing him were filled with rage and said, \xc2\x93We have all taken\nfood; our desires have been fulfilled; you better now go back to your own\nhome.\n\n\n\n44-45. Your behaviour with us is all right and proper; now do your other\nduties and let the kings go back to their homes.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of the\nkings, the king of Benares was very much terrified and returned home, thinking\nthat the kings were all filled with rage and might do serious harm to him.\nThus he began to pass away his time in dire anxiety.\n\n\n\np. 213\n\n\n\n46\\. Then the king Subahu disappeared; the kings united made this resolve that\nthey would block the passage of Sudars\xc2\x92ana, kill him, and take the girl away.\n\n\n\n47\\. Some of these kings rather said :-- \xc2\x93What is the use in killing the\nking\xc2\x92s son. We will all go willingly to see the fun.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n48\\. Thus the kings went and remained blocking the path of Sudars\xc2\x92ana; and the\nking Subahu, on returning home, began to make arrangements for the departure\nof the bridegroom and the bride.\n\n\n\nThus ends the 22nd Chapter on Sudars\xc2\x92ana's marriage in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 23](bk03ch23.htm)\n\n"
