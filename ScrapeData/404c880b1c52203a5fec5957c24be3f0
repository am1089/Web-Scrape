The  \nwealth-possessing Gods supported Agni.  \n3 The Sapient One arrays himself in every form: for quadruped  \nand biped he hath brought forth good.  \nExcellent Savitar hath looked on heaven's high vault: he  \nshineth after the outgoings of the Dawn.  \n4 Thou art the goodly-pinioned Bird: thou hast the Trivrit for  \nthy head.  \nGayatra is thine eye, thy wings are Brihat and Rathantara.  \nThe hymn is self, the metres are his limbs, the formulas his  \nname.  \nThe Vamadevya Saman is thy form, the Yaj\xc3\xb1ayaj\xc3\xb1iya thy  \ntail, the fire-hearths are thy hooves.  \nThou art the goodly-pinioned Bird: go skyward, soar to  \nheavenly light.\n\np. 101\n\n5 Thou art the riyal-slaying stride of Vishnu. Mount the  \nGayatra metre: stride along the earth.  \nThou art the foe-destroying stride of Vishnu. Mount the  \nTrishtup metre: stride along mid-air.  \nThou art the traitor-slaying stride of Vishnu. Mount the  \nJagati metre: stride along the sky.  \nThou art the foeman-slaying stride of Vishnu. Mount  \nAnushtup metre: stride along the Quarters.  \n6 Agni roared out like Dyaus what time he thunders: licking  \nfull oft the earth round plants he flickered.  \nAt once, when born, he looked about, enkindled: he shineth  \nforth between the earth and heaven.  \n7 Return to me, thou still-returning Agni, with life, with  \nlustre, progeny, and treasure,  \nWith profit, wisdom, riches, and abundance.  \n8 A hundred, Agni Angiras! be thy ways, a thousand thy  \nreturns.  \nWith increment of increase bring thou back to us what we  \nhave lost. Again bring hitherward our wealth.  \n9 Return again with nourishment; Agni, again with food and  \nlife. Again preserve us from distress.  \n10 Agni, return with store of wealth. Swell with thine overflowing  \nstream that feedeth all on every side.  \n11 I brought thee: thou hast entered in. Stand stedfast and  \nimmovable.  \nLot all the people long for thee. Let not thy kingship fall  \naway.  \n12 Varuna, from the upmost bond release us, let down the  \nlowest and remove the midmost.  \nSo in thy holy law may we made sinless belong to Aditi, O  \nthou \xc3\x82ditya.\n\np. 102\n\n13 High hath the Mighty risen before the Mornings, and come  \nto us with light from out the darkness.  \nFair-shapen Agni with white-shining splendour hath filled  \nat birth all human habitations.  \n14 The Hamsa homed in light, the Vasu in mid-air, the Priest  \nbeside the altar, Guest within the house,  \nDweller in noblest place, mid men, in truth, in sky, born  \nof flood, kine, truth, mountain, he is holy Law. The Great.  \n15 Knowing all holy ordinances, Agni, be seated in the lap of  \nthis thy mother.  \nDo not with heat or glowing flame consume her: shine thou  \nwithin her with refulgent lustre.  \n16 Within this Fire-pan with thy light, O Agni, in thy proper seat,  \nGlowing with warmth, be gracious thou, O Jatavedas, unto her.  \n17 Being propitious unto me, O Agni, sit propitiously.  \nHaving made all the regions blest, in thine own dwelling  \nseat thyself.  \n18 First Agni sprang to life from out of heaven, the second  \ntime from us came Jatavedas.  \nThirdly the Manly-souled was in the waters. The pious  \nlauds and kindles him Eternal.  \n19 Agni, we know thy three powers in three stations, we know  \nthy forms in many a place divided.  \nWe know what name supreme thou hast in secret: we know  \nthe source from which thou hast proceeded.  \n20 The Manly-souled lit thee in sea and waters, Man's Viewer  \nlit thee in the breast of heaven.  \nThere as thou stoodest in the third high region the Bulls  \nincreased thee in the waters\xc2\x92 bosom.\n\np. 103\n\n21 Agni roared out, etc. (verse 6 repeated).  \n22 The spring of glories and support of riches, rouser of  \nthoughts and guardian of the Soma,  \nGood Son of Strength, a King amid the waters, in forefront  \nof the Dawns he shines enkindled.  \n23 Germ of the world, ensign of all creation, he sprang to life  \nand filled the earth and heaven.  \nEven the firm rock he cleft when passing over, when the  \nFive Tribes brought sacrifice to Agni.  \n24 So among mortals was immortal Agni stablished as cleansing,  \nwise, and eager envoy.  \nHe waves the red smoke that he lifts above him, striving  \nto reach the heaven with radiant lustre.  \n25 Far hath he shone, etc. (verse 1 repeated).  \n26 Whoso this day, O God whose flames are lovely, makes thee  \na cake, O Agni, mixed with butter,  \nLead thou and further him to higher fortune, to bliss bestowed  \nby Gods, O thou Most Youthful.  \n27 Endow him, Agni, with a share of glory, at every, song of  \npraise sung forth enrich him.  \nDear let him be to Surya, dear to Agni, preeminent with son  \nand children's children.  \n28 While, Agni, day by day men pay thee worship they win  \nthemselves all treasures worth the wishing.  \nAllied with thee, eager and craving riches, they have disclosed  \nthe stable filled with cattle.  \n29 Agni, man's gracious Friend, the Soma's keeper, Vaisvanara,  \nhath been lauded by the Rishis.  \nWe will invoke benignant Earth and Heaven: ye Deities,  \ngive us wealth with hero children.  \n30 Pay service unto Agni with your fuel, rouse your Guest  \nwith oil:  \nIn him present your offerings.\n\np. 104\n\n31 May all the Gods, O Agni, bear thee upward with their earnest  \nthoughts:  \nNot to be looked on, rich in light, be thou propitious unto us,  \n32 Agni, go forth resplendent, thou with thine auspicious flames  \nof fire.  \nShining with mighty beams of light harm not my people  \nwith thy form.  \n33 Agni roared out, etc. (verse 21 repeated.)  \n34 Far famed is this the Bharata's own Agni: he shineth like  \nthe Sun with lofty splendour.  \nHe who hath vanquished Puru in the battle, the heavenly  \nGuest hath shone for us benignly.  \n35 Receive these ashes, ye celestial Waters, and lay them in a  \nfair place full of fragrance.  \nTo him bow down the nobly-wedded Matrons! Bear this on  \nwaters as her son a mother.  \n36 Agni, thy home is in the floods: into the plants thou forcest  \nway,  \nAnd as their child art born anew.  \n37 Thou art the offspring of the plants, thou art the offspring  \nof the trees:  \nThe offspring thou of all that is, thou, Agni, art the Waters\xc2\x92  \nChild,  \n38 With ashes having reached the womb, the waters, Agni  \nand the earth,  \nUnited with the mothers, thou blazing hast seated thee again.  \n39 Seated again upon thy seat, the waters, Agni! and the earth,  \nIn her, thou, most auspicious One, liest as in a mother's lap\n\np. 105\n\n40, 41 Return again, etc. Agni, return, etc. (verses 9 and 10  \nrepeated).  \n42 Mark this my speech, Divine One, thou Most Youthful,  \noffered to thee by him who gives most freely:  \nOne hates thee, and another sings thy praises. I thine  \nadorer laud thy form, O Agni.  \n43 Be thou for us a liberal Prince, Giver and Lord of precious  \nthings.  \nDrive those who hate us far away.  \nTo the Omnific One All-hail!  \n14 Again let the \xc3\x82dityas, Rudras, Yams, and Brahmans with  \ntheir rites light thee, Wealth-bringer!  \nIncrease thy body with presented butter: effectual be the  \nSacrificer's wishes.  \n45 Go hence, depart, creep off in all directions, both ancient  \nvisitors and recent comers:  \nYama hath given a place on earth to rest in. This place  \nfor him the Fathers have provided.  \n46 Knowledge art thou: accomplishment of wishes. In me be  \nthe fulfilment of thy wishes.  \nThou art the ashes, thou the mould of Agni. Rankers are  \nye, rankers around. Rankers right upward, be ye fixed.\n\np. 106\n\n47 This is that Agni where the longing Indra took the pressed  \nSoma deep within his body.  \nWinner of spoils in thousands like a courser, with prayer art  \nthou exalted, Jatavedas.  \n48 The splendour which is thine in heaven, O Agni, in earth, O  \nHoly One, in plants, in waters,  \nWherewith thou hast o\xc2\x92erspread mid-air's broad region, that  \nlight is brilliant, billowy, man-surveying.  \n49 O Agni, to the flood of heaven thou mountest, thou tallest  \nhither Gods, the thought-inspirers.  \nThe waters, those beyond the light of Surya, and those  \nthat are beneath it here, approach thee.  \n50 May the Purishya Agnis in accord with those that spring  \nfrom floods,  \nMay they, benevolent, accept the sacrifice, full, wholesome  \ndraughts.  \n51 As holy food, Agni, to thine invoker give wealth in cattle,  \nlasting, rich in marvels.  \nTo us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this  \nthy gracious will to us-ward.  \n52 This is thine ordered place of birth whence, sprung to life,  \nthou shonest forth.  \nKnowing this, Agni, mount on high and cause our riches to  \nincrease.  \n53 Ranker art thou: Angiras-like sit steady with that Deity.  \nRanker-round art thou: Angiras-like sit steady with that  \nDeity.\n\np. 107\n\n54 Fill up the room, supply the void, then settle steady in thy  \nplace.  \nIndr-\xc3\x82gni and Brihaspati have set thee down in this abode.  \n55 The dappled kine who stream with milk prepare his draught  \nof Soma juice\xc2\x97  \nClans in the birthplace of the Gods, in the three luminous  \nrealms of heaven.  \n56 All sacred songs have magnified Indra expansive as the sea,  \nThe best of warriors borne on cars, the Lord, the very Lord  \nof Strength.  \n57 Combine ye two and harmonize together, dear to each other,  \nbrilliant, friendly-minded,  \nAbiding in one place for food and vigour.  \n58 Together have I brought your minds, your ordinances, and  \nyour thoughts.  \nBe thou our Sovran Lord, Agni Purishya; give food and  \nvigour to the Sacrificer.  \n59 Thou art Purishya Agni, thou art wealthy, thou art prosperous.  \nHaving made all the regions blest, here seat thee in thine  \nown abode.  \n60 Be ye one-minded unto us, both of one thought, free from  \ndeceit.  \nHarm not the sacrifice, harm not the Patron of the sacrifice.  \nBe gracious unto us to-day, ye knowers of all things that be.  \n61 Even as a mother bears her son, Earth, Ukha hath borne  \nwithin her womb Purishya Agni.  \nMaker of all, accordant with the All-Gods and Seasons, may  \nPrajapati release her.  \n62 Seek him who pours not, offers not oblation; follow the  \ngoing of the thief and robber.\n\np. 108\n\nThis is thy way; leave us and seek some other. To thee,  \nO Goddess Nirriti, be homage.  \n63 To thee, sharp-pointed Nirriti, full homage! Loose and  \ndetach this iron bond that binds him.  \nUnanimous with Yama and with Yami to the sublimest  \nvault of heaven uplift him.  \n64 Thou, Awful One, thou in whose mouth I offer for the unloosing  \nof these binding fetters,  \nWhom people hail as Earth with their glad voices, as Nirriti  \nin every place I know thee.  \n65 The binding noose which Nirriti the Goddess hath fastened  \non thy neck that none may loose it,  \nI loose for thee as from the midst of \xc3\x82yus. Sped forward  \nnow, eat thou the food we offer:  \nTo Fortune, her who hath done this, be homage.  \n66 Establisher, the gatherer of treasures, he looks with might  \non every form and figure.  \nLike Savitar the God whose laws are constant, like Indra,  \nhe hath stood where meet the pathways.  \n67 Wise, through desire of bliss with Gods, the skilful bind the  \ntraces fast, and lay the yokes on either side.  \n68 Lay on the yokes and fasten well the traces; formed is the  \nfurrow sow the seed within it.  \nThrough song may we find hearing fraught with plenty:  \nnear to the ripened grain approach the sickle.\n\np. 109\n\n69 Happily let the shares turn up the ploughland, happily go  \nthe ploughers with the oxen!  \nSuna and Sira, pleased with our oblation, cause ye our  \nplants to bear abundant fruitage.  \n70 Approved by Visvedevas and by Maruts, balmed be the  \nfurrow with sweet-flavoured fatness.  \nSucculent, teeming with thy milky treasure, turn hitherward  \nto us with milk, O Furrow.  \n71 The keen-shared plough that bringeth bliss, good for the  \nSoma-drinker's need,  \nShear out for me a cow, a sheep, a rapid drawer of the car,  \na blooming woman, plump and strong!  \n72 Milk out their wish, O Wishing-Cow, to Mitra and to Varuna,  \nTo Indra, to the Asvins, to Pushan, to people and to plants.  \n73 Be loosed, inviolable, Godward-farers! We have attained  \nthe limit of this darkness: we have won the light.  \n71 The year together with the darksome fortnights; Dawn with  \nthe ruddy-coloured cows about her; the Asvins with  \ntheir wonderful achievements; the Sun together with his  \ndappled Courser; Vaisvanara with Ida and with butter.  \nSvaha!  \n75 Herbs that sprang up in time of old, three ages earlier than  \nthe Gods,\xc2\x97  \nOf these, whose hue is brown, will I declare the hundred  \npowers and seven.\n\np. 110\n\n76 Ye, Mothers, have a hundred homes, yea, and a thousand are  \nyour growths.  \nDo ye who have a thousand powers free this my patient from  \ndisease.  \n77 Be glad and joyful in the Plants, both blossoming and bearing  \nfruit,  \nPlants that will lead us to success like mares who conquer in  \nthe race.  \n78 Plants, by this name I speak to you, Mothers, to you the  \nGoddesses:  \nSteed, cow, and garment may I win, win back thy very self,  \nO man.  \n79 The Holy Fig tree is your home, your mansion is the Parna  \ntree:  \nWinners of cattle shall ye be if ye regain for me this man.  \n80 He who hath store of Herbs at hand like Kings amid a crowd  \nof men,\xc2\x97  \nPhysician is that sage's name, fiend-slayer, chaser of disease.  \n81 Herbs rich in Soma, rich in steeds, in nourishment in strengthening  \npower,  \nAll these have I provided here, that this man may be whole  \nagain.  \n82 The healing virtues of the Plants stream forth like cattle  \nfrom the stall,\xc2\x97  \nPlants that shall win me store of wealth, and save thy vital  \nbreath, O man.  \n83 Reliever is your mother's name, and hence Restorers are ye  \ncalled.  \nRivers are ye with wings that fly: keep far whatever brings  \ndisease.  \n84 Over all fences have they passed, as steals a thief into the fold.  \nThe Plants have driven from the frame whatever malady was  \nthere.  \n85 When, bringing back the vanished strength, I hold these herbs  \nwithin my hand,  \nThe spirit of disease departs ere he can seize upon the life.  \n86 He through whose frame, O Plants, ye creep member by  \nmember, joint by joint,  \nFrom him ye drive away disease like some strong arbiter of  \nstrife.  \n87 Fly, Spirit of Disease, begone, with the blue jay and kingfisher.  \nFly, with the wind's impetuous speed, vanish together with  \nthe storm.\n\np. 111\n\n88 Help every one the other, lend assistance each of you to  \neach,  \nAll of you be accordant, give furtherance to this speech of  \nmine.  \n89 Let fruitful Plants, and fruitless, those that blossom, and  \nthe blossomless,  \nUrged onward by Brihaspati, release us from our pain and  \ngrief;  \n90 [Release](errata.htm#4) me from the curse's plague and woe that comes from  \nVaruna;  \nFree me from Yama's fetter, from sin and offence against the  \nGods.  \n91 What time, descending from the sky, the Plants flew earthward,  \nthus they spake:  \nNo evil shall befall the man whom while he liveth we  \npervade.  \n92 Of all the many Plants whose King is Soma, Plants of hundred  \nforms,  \nThou art the Plant most excellent, prompt to the wish, sweet  \nto the heart.  \n93 O all ye various Herbs whose King is Soma, that o\xc2\x92erspread  \nthe earth,  \nUrged onward by Brihaspati, combine your virtue in this  \nPlant.  \n94 All Plants that hear this speech, and those that have  \ndeparted far away,  \nCome all assembled and confer your healing power upon  \nthis Herb.  \n95 Unharmed be he who digs you up, unharmed the man for  \nwhom I dig:  \nAnd let no malady attack biped or quadruped of ours.  \n96 With Soma as their Sovran Lord the Plants hold colloquy  \nand say:  \nO King, we save from death the man whose cure a Brahman  \nundertakes.  \n97 Most excellent of all art thou, O Plant: thy vassals are the  \ntrees.  \nLet him be subject to our power, the man who seeks to  \ninjure us.  \n98 Banisher of catarrh art thou, of tumours and of hemorrhoids;  \nThou banished Pakaru and Consumption in a hundred  \nforms.\n\np. 112\n\n99 Thee did Gandharvas dig from earth, thee Indra and  \nBrihaspati.  \nKing Soma, knowing thee, O Plant, from his Consumption  \nwas made free.  \n100 Conquer mine enemies, the men who challenge me do thou  \nsubdue.  \nConquer thou all unhappiness: victorious art thou, O Plant.  \n101 Long-lived be he who digs thee, Plant, and he for whom I  \ndig thee up.  \nSo mayst thou also, grown long-lived, rise upward with a  \nhundred shoots.  \n102 Most excellent of all art thou, O Plant; thy vassals are the  \ntrees.  \nLet him be subject to our power, the man who seeks to  \ninjure us.  \n103 May he not harm me who is earth's begetter, nor he whose  \nlaws are faithful, sky's pervades;  \nNor he who first begot the lucid waters. To Ka the God  \nlet us present oblation.  \n104 Turn thyself hitherward, O Earth, to us with sacrifice and  \nmilk.  \nThy covering skin Agni, urged forth, hath mounted.  \n105 All, Agni, that in thee is bright, pure, cleansed, and meet  \nfor sacrifice,  \nThat do we bring unto the Gods.  \n106 I from this place have fed on strength and vigour, the  \nwomb of holy Law, stream of the mighty.  \nIn cows let it possess me and in bodies. I quit decline and  \nlack of food, and sickness.  \n107 Agni, life-power and fame are thine: thy fires blaze mightily,  \nthou rich in wealth of beams!  \nSage, passing bright, thou givest to the worshipper, with  \nstrength, the food that merits laud.  \n108 With brilliant, purifying sheen, with perfect sheen thou  \nliftest up thyself in light.  \nThou, visiting both thy Mothers, aidest them as Son: thou  \njoinest close the earth and heaven.\n\np. 113\n\n109 O Jatavedas, Son of Strength, rejoice thyself, gracious, in  \nour fair hymns and songs.  \nIn thee are treasured various forms of strengthening food,  \nborn nobly and of wondrous help.  \n110 Agni, spread forth, as Ruler, over living things: give wealth  \nto us, Immortal God.  \nThou shinest out from beauty fair to look upon: thou  \nleadest us to conquering power.  \n111 To him, the wise, who orders sacrifice, who hath great riches  \nunder his control,  \nThou givest blest award of good, and plenteous food, givest  \nhim wealth that conquers all.  \n112 The men have set before them for their welfare Agni, strong,  \nvisible to all, the Holy.  \nThee, Godlike One, with ears to hear, most famous, men's  \ngenerations magnify with praise-songs.  \n113 Soma, wax great. From every side may vigorous powers  \nunite in thee.  \nBe in the gathering-place of strength.  \n114 In thee be juicy nutriments united, and power and mighty  \nfoe-subduing vigour.  \nWaxing to immortality, O Soma, win highest glory for  \nthyself in heaven.  \n115 Wax, O most gladdening Soma, great through all thy  \nfilaments, and be  \nA friend of most illustrious fame to prosper us.  \n116 May Vatsa draw thy mind away, even from thy loftiest  \ndwelling-place,  \nAgni, with song that yearns for thee.  \n117 Agni, best Angiras, to thee all people who have pleasant  \nhomes  \nApart have turned to gain their wish.  \n118 In dear homes, Agni, the desire of all that is and is to be,  \nShines forth the One Imperial Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XIII](wyvbk13.htm)\n\n"
