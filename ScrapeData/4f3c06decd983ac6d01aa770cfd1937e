[1885], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 411\n\n4:5:7\n\n### SEVENTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n4:5:7:11\\. Now, there are here thirty-four utterances, called expiations 1.\nPra _g_ apati, forsooth, is that sacrifice which is performed here, and from\nwhich these creatures have been produced,--and in like manner are they\nproduced therefrom even to this day.\n\n4:5:7:22\\. There are eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve \xc3\x82dityas; and these\ntwo, Heaven and Earth, are the (thirty-second and) thirty-third. And there are\nthirty-three gods, and Pra _g_ apati is the thirty-fourth;--thus he makes him\n(the sacrificer, or Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a) to be Pra _g_ apati 2: now that 3 is, for\nthat is immortal, and what is immortal that is. But what is mortal that also\nis Pra _g_ apati; for Pra _g_ apati is everything: thus he makes him to be Pra\n_g_ apati, and hence there are these thirty-four utterances, called\nexpiations.\n\n4:5:7:33\\. Now some call these (formulas) the 'forms of the sacrifice;' but,\nindeed, they are rather the joints of the sacrifice: this same sacrifice, in\nbeing performed, is continually becoming those deities.\n\n4:5:7:44\\. Now should the cow, which supplies the gharma 4, fail (to give\nmilk), let them go to another; and at the same place where they otherwise make\nthat gharma (milk) flow 5, let them place her with her\n\np. 412\n\nhead towards the north, or in front of the hall with her face to the east.\n\n4:5:7:55\\. And that which is the right one of the two bones with hair-tufts\nwhich protrude on both sides of her tail-bone,--thereon he offers those\nthirty-four oblations of ghee; for as much as are those thirty-four\nutterances, so much is the sacrifice: thus he lays the whole sacrifice\nentirely into her; for therefrom she lets the gharma (milk) flow, and this is\nthe atonement therefore.\n\n4:5:7:66\\. And if any part of the sacrifice were to fail, let him make an\noblation with regard thereto on the \xc3\x82havaniya during the consecration and the\nUpasads, and on the \xc3\x82gnidhra during the Soma feast--for whatever point of the\nsacrifice fails, that breaks--and whichever then is the deity in that (special\noffering), through that one he heals it, through that he puts it together\nagain.\n\n4:5:7:77\\. And if anything 1 be spilt, let him pour water thereon--everything\nhere being pervaded (or obtained) by water--for the obtainment of everything\n2; with a verse to Vish _n_ u and Varu _n_ a,--for whatsoever distress one\nundergoes here on earth, all that Varu _n_ a inflicts 3,--(Va _g_. S. VIII,\n59; Atharva-veda VII, 25, 1),\n\np. 413\n\n[paragraph continues] 'They by whose vigour the spheres were propped up, who\nare in strength the strongest and mightiest; who sway with powers unresisted,\nto Vish _n_ u and Varu _n_ a hath it gone at the morning prayer!' For Vish _n_\nu is the sacrifice, and it is that (sacrifice) of his which now undergoes\ndistress; and Varu _n_ a is the inflicter: thus by both these deities--that\nwhose (sacrifice) undergoes distress, and that which inflicts it--he heals\n(the joint of the sacrifice), by both he puts it together.\n\n4:5:7:88\\. And let him then touch (the spilt material) with (Va _g_. S. VIII,\n60), 'To the gods, to the sky hath the sacrifice gone: may wealth thence\naccrue to me! to the men, to the air hath the sacrifice gone: may wealth\nthence accrue to me! to the Fathers, to the earth hath the sacrifice gone: may\nwealth thence accrue to me!'--'To whatever world the sacrifice has gone,\nthence happiness has come to me 1!' this is what he thereby means to say.\n\n4:5:7:99\\. Here now \xc3\x82ru _n_ i said, 'Why should he sacrifice who would think\nhimself the worse for a miscarriage of the sacrifice? I, for one, am the\nbetter for a miscarriage of the sacrifice 2!' This, then, he said with\nreference to the adoption of those benedictions.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[411:1](sbe2666.htm#fr_959) Viz. the formulas, Va _g_. S. VIII, 54-58,\nemployed for making good any mishaps during the Soma-sacrifice. Cf. _S_ at.\nBr. XII, 6, 1, 1 seq. In the Ka _n_ va recension, V, 7, 4, ka _n_ _d_ ikas\n5-10 correspond to the present Brahma _n_ a, while ka _n_ _d_ ikas 1-4 contain\nthe account of the Mahavratiya graha corresponding to M. IV, 6, 4.\n\n[411:2](sbe2666.htm#fr_960) ? Or, this then he makes Pra _g_ apati to be; but\nsee [IV, 6, 1, 5](sbe2670.htm#4:6:1:5).\n\n[411:3](sbe2666.htm#fr_961) ? I.e. that divine race or element. The Ka _n_ va\ntext reads, etavad va idam asty, etad dhy am _ri_ tam, yad dhy am _ri_ ta _m_\ntad asti.\n\n[411:4](sbe2666.htm#fr_962) See [p. 104](sbe2617.htm#page_104), note\n[3](sbe2618.htm#fn_272).\n\n[411:5](sbe2666.htm#fr_963) That is, when they milk the cow with the Mantras\n'Flow thou p. 412 for the A _s_ vins!' &c., see [IV, 2, 1,\n11](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:11) seq. Perhaps yasya _m_ velayam has to be taken in\nthe sense of 'at the same time at which they make it flow,' as is done in the\nSt. Petersb. Dict. Compare, however, the Ka _n_ va reading, tad yam upasa _m_\nkrameyus tam agre _n_ a va dikshita _s_ ala _m_ yatra vainam etat pinvayanti\ntad enam pra _k_ i _m_ vodi _k_ i _m_ va sthapayitavai bruyat.\n\n[412:1](sbe2666.htm#fr_964) Viz. any Soma, according to Katy. XXV, 2, 9; or\nany clotted ghee (p _ri_ shada _g_ ya), according to the Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[412:2](sbe2666.htm#fr_965) For this construction, see [p.\n15](sbe2605.htm#page_15), note [3](sbe2605.htm#fn_55).\n\n[412:3](sbe2666.htm#fr_966) Or, whatsoever undergoes (suffering) here on\nearth, all that Varu _n_ a causes to undergo it.\n\n[413:1](sbe2666.htm#fr_967) This last sentence ('To whatever world . . .') is\ntreated as if it belonged to the sacrificial formula, to which it is attached\nin the Sa _m_ hita. The mistake (which doubtless there is) probably arose from\nthe omission of the 'iti' in the Brahma _n_ a. In the Ka _n_ va text of the\nBrahma _n_ a, the analogous sentence appears clearly as belonging to the\nexposition, and not to the Sa _m_ hita.\n\n[413:2](sbe2666.htm#fr_968) Ki _m_ sa ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ena ya _g_ eteti yo ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a _h_ syat tena vy _ri_ ddhena _s_ reyo nabhiga _kh_ ed iti. Ka _n_ va\ntext.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 5, 8. Eighth Brahma _n_ a](sbe2667.htm)\n\n"
