If it be said (that Brahman is not meant) on account of characteristic\nmarks of the individual soul and the chief vital air; we say no, on account of\nthe threefoldness of meditation; on account of (such threefold meditation)\nbeing met (in other texts also); and on account of (such threefold meditation)\nbeing appropriate here (also).\n\nAn objection is raised. 'Let none try to find out what speech is, let him know\nthe speaker'; 'I slew the three-headed son of Tvash _tri_ ; I delivered the\nArunmukhas, the devotees, to the wolves'; these passages state characteristic\nmarks of an individual soul (viz. the god Indra).--'As long as Pra _n_ a\ndwells in this body, so long there is life'; 'Pra _n_ a alone is the conscious\nSelf, and having laid hold of this body, it makes it rise up.'--These passages\nagain mention\n\np. 254\n\ncharacteristic attributes of the chief vital air. Hence there is here no\n'multitude of attributes belonging to the Self.'--The latter part of the Sutra\nrefutes this objection. The highest Self is called by these different terms in\norder to teach threefoldness of devout meditation; viz. meditation on Brahman\nin itself as the cause of the entire world; on Brahman as having for its body\nthe totality of enjoying (individual) souls; and on Brahman as having for its\nbody the objects and means of enjoyment.--This threefold meditation on\nBrahman, moreover, is met with also in other chapters of the sacred text.\nPassages such as 'The True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman,' 'Bliss is\nBrahman,' dwell on Brahman in itself. Passages again such as 'Having created\nthat he entered into it. Having entered it he became _sat_ and _tyat_ ,\ndefined and undefined,' &c. (Taitt. Up. II, 6), represent Brahman as having\nfor its body the individual souls and inanimate nature. Hence, in the chapter\nunder discussion also, this threefold view of Brahman is quite appropriate.\nWhere to particular individual beings such as Hira _n_ yagarbha, and so on, or\nto particular inanimate things such as prak _ri_ ti, and so on, there are\nattributed qualities especially belonging--to the highest Self; or where with\nwords denoting such persons and things there are co-ordinated terms denoting\nthe highest Self, the intention of the texts is to convey the idea of the\nhighest Self being the inner Self of all such persons and things.--The settled\nconclusion, therefore, is that the being designated as Indra and Pra _n_ a is\nother than an individual soul, viz. the highest Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Second Pada](sbe48066.htm)\n\n"
