He follows her, stepping into seven foot-prints of hers 2; he\nthereby takes possession of her: that\n\np. 59\n\nis why he steps into seven of her foot-prints. For when the metres were\nproduced from Va _k_ (speech), the one consisting of seven feet, the _S_\nakvari, was the last (highest) of them. It is that (metre) he now draws down\ntowards himself from above: this is why he steps into seven of her foot-\nprints.\n\n3:3:1:22\\. It is as Va _k_  1 that he steps into them; (with the text, Va _g_.\nS. IV, 21), \'Thou art a Vasvi, thou art Aditi, thou art an \xc3\x82ditya, thou art a\nRudra, thou art _K_ andra; for she is indeed a Vasvi and Aditi, an \xc3\x82ditya, a\nRudra, _K_ andra. \'May B _ri_ haspati make thee rest in happiness!\'--B _ri_\nhaspati being the Brahman, he thereby means to say, \'May B _ri_ haspati lead\nthee hither by means of the good (work) 2!\' \'Rudra, together with the Vasus,\nis well-pleased with thee:\' this he says to secure her (the cow\'s) safety, for\ncattle cannot pass beyond Rudra.\n\n3:3:1:33\\. They now sit down 3 round the seventh footprint; and having laid\ndown the piece of gold in the foot-print, he offers. For offering is made on\nnothing but fire, and the gold has sprung from Agni\'s seed: and thus that\noffering of his is indeed made over\n\np. 60\n\nthe fire. And the clarified butter being a thunderbolt, he now delivers her\n(the cow) by means of that thunderbolt, the butter; and by delivering her he\nmakes her his own.\n\n3:3:1:44\\. He (the Adhvaryu) offers (with the text, Va _g_. S. IV, 22), \'On\nAditi\'s head I pour thee;\' for Aditi being this earth, it is on the head of\nthe latter that he offers;--\'on the worshipping-ground of the earth\'--for on\nthe worshipping-ground of the earth he indeed offers;--\'Thou art I _d_ a\'s\nfootprint, filled with butter, Hail!\' for I _d_ a being the cow 1, he indeed\noffers on the cow\'s foot-print; and \'filled with butter, Hail!\' he says,\nbecause it indeed becomes filled with butter when offered upon.\n\n3:3:1:55\\. Thereupon he takes the wooden sword and draws lines round (the\nfoot-print): the wooden sword being a thunderbolt, it is with the thunderbolt\nthat he draws round it. Thrice he draws round it, so that he encompasses it on\nall sides with a threefold thunderbolt, for no one to trespass upon it.\n\n3:3:1:66\\. He draws the lines (with the texts), \'Rejoice in us!\' whereby he\nmeans to say, \'Rejoice in the sacrificer!\' Having then, by tracing, cut out\nthe foot-print all round 2, he throws it into the pan, with, \'In us is thy\nkinship,\' whereby he means to say, \'In the sacrificer is thy kinship.\'\n\n3:3:1:77\\. He then pours some water on (the place whence the earth has been\nremoved). Wherever in digging they hurt her (the earth) and knock off anything\n\np. 61\n\nfrom her,--water being (a means of) soothing,--that he now soothes by means of\nwater, that he heals by means of water: that is why he pours water thereon.\n\n3:3:1:88\\. He then hands (the dust of) the foot-print to the sacrificer, with,\n\'In thee is wealth,\'--wealth meaning cattle, he thereby means to say, \'in thee\nis cattle.\' The sacrificer receives it with, \'With me 1 is wealth,\'--wealth\nmeaning cattle, he thereby means to say, \'with me is cattle.\'\n\n3:3:1:99\\. The Adhvaryu then touches himself (near the heart), with, \'May we\nnot be deprived of prosperity!\' Thus the Adhvaryu does not exclude himself\nfrom (the possession of) cattle.\n\n3:3:1:1010\\. Thereupon they hand (the dust of) the footprint over to the\n(sacrificer\'s) wife. The house being the wife\'s resting-place, he thereby\nestablishes her in that safe resting-place, the house: for this reason he\nhands over the (earth of the) foot-print to the wife.\n\n3:3:1:1111\\. The Nesh _t_ _ri_ makes her say, \'Thine, thine 2 is wealth;\'\nwhereupon he causes her to be looked at by the Soma-cow. Now, Soma is a male,\nand the wife is a female, and that Soma-cow becomes here (exchanged for) Soma:\na productive union is thus effected;--this is why he causes her to be looked\nat by the Soma-cow.\n\n3:3:1:1212\\. He causes her to be looked at (while she pronounces the text, Va\n_g_. S. IV, 23), \'I have seen eye to eye with the divine intelligence, with\nthe far-seeing Dakshi _n_ a: take\n\np. 62\n\nnot my life from me, neither will I take thine; may I obtain a hero 1 in thy\nsight!\' She thereby asks a blessing: a hero meaning a son, she thereby means\nto say, \'May I obtain a son in thy sight!\'\n\n3:3:1:1313\\. One that is brown, with red-brown eyes, is (fit to be) a Soma-\ncow. For when Indra and Vish _n_ u divided a thousand (cows) into three parts,\nthere was one left 2, and her they caused to propagate herself in three kinds;\nand hence, even now, if any one were to divide a thousand by three, one would\nremain over.\n\n3:3:1:1414\\. The brown one, with red-brown eyes, is the Soma-cow; and that\nruddy one is the V _ri_ tra-killer\'s (India\'s) own, whom the king here chooses\nfor himself 3 after winning the battle; and the ruddy one with reddish-white\neyes 4 is the Fathers\' own whom they slay here for the Fathers.\n\n3:3:1:1515\\. Let, then, the brown one, with red-brown eyes, be the Soma-cow.\nAnd if he be unable to obtain a brown one with red-brown eyes, let it be a\ndark-red 5 one. And if he be unable to obtain a dark-red one, let it be a\nruddy one, one of the\n\np. 63\n\n[paragraph continues] V _ri_ tra-killer\'s own. But let him nowise turn his\nfancy upon a ruddy one with reddish-white eyes.\n\n3:3:1:1616\\. Let it be one that is not impregnated. For that Soma-cow is in\nreality Va _k_ , and this Va _k_ (speech) is of unimpaired vigour; and of\nunimpaired vigour is one not (yet) impregnated: let it therefore be one not\nimpregnated. Let it be one that is neither tailless, nor hornless, nor one-\neyed, nor ear-less 1, nor specially marked, nor seven-hoofed 2;--for such a\none is uniform, and uniform is this speech.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[58:2](sbe2611.htm#fr_158) Viz. into seven foot-prints of her right fore-foot.\nAccording to p. 59 Taitt. S. VI, 1, 8, 1 he steps into six foot-prints and\noffers on the seventh. According to Katy. VII, 6, 17 they pass (or overstep,\natikram) six foot-prints and sit down round the seventh.\n\n[59:1](sbe2611.htm#fr_159) Literally, \'by a form (rupe _n_ a) of Va _k_\n(speech),\' viz. the text which is pronounced.\n\n[59:2](sbe2611.htm#fr_160) This can scarcely be the correct reading. The Ka\n_n_ va text has the more acceptable reading, \'B _ri_ haspati being the\nBrahman, and felicity the sacrifice, he thereby says, "May the Brahman make\nthee rest (or delight, ramayatu) in the good (work), the sacrifice!"\'\n\n[59:3](sbe2611.htm#fr_161) According to the comm. on Katy. VII, 6, 17 the\nBrahman and the Sacrificer are to sit on the south, the Adhvaryu on the west,\nand the Nesh _t_ _ri_ on the north side of the foot-print.\n\n[60:1](sbe2611.htm#fr_162) See the legend, part i, p. 216 seq.; especially I,\n8, 1, 7; 20; and p. 226, note 3.\n\n[60:2](sbe2611.htm#fr_163) According to the comm. on Katy. VII, 6, 20, it\nwould rather seem that he scratches with the sphya all over the foot-print and\nthen takes out the loose dust (pa _m_ sun) and throws it into the pan.\n\n[61:1](sbe2611.htm#fr_164) The Ka _n_ va text (Sa _m_ hita and Br.) has asme\ninstead of me.\n\n[61:2](sbe2611.htm#fr_165) See St. Petersb. Dict. s. v. totas. The Ka _n_ va\ntext explains it similarly: \'tvayi tvayi pa _s_ ava _h_.\' The Taitt. S. VI, 1,\n8, 5 has \'Tote raya _h_ \'--"Thine (?) is wealth" thus for the wife, for she,\nthe wife, is one half of himself.\'\n\n[62:1](sbe2611.htm#fr_166) The Ka _n_ va text reads \'may I obtain heroes.\'\n\n[62:2](sbe2611.htm#fr_167) This arithmetical feat of Indra and Vish _n_ u is\napparently already referred to in Rig-veda VI, 69, 8, though nothing is said\nthere as to the difficulty regarding the odd cow. The threefold division seems\nto refer to Vish _n_ u\'s three steps, by which (as the sun) he measures the\nsky; or to the division of the universe into the three worlds (?). See also\nAit. Br. VI, 15.\n\n[62:3](sbe2611.htm#fr_168) Or, drives forth (from the enemy\'s stables). The\nred cows are compared with the red clouds, which appear after the thunderstorm\n(i.e. after king Indra\'s battle with V _ri_ tra).\n\n[62:4](sbe2611.htm#fr_169) Saya _n_ a takes \' _s_ yetakshi\' as \'black-eyed (k\n_ri_ sh _n_ alo _k_ ana).\'\n\n[62:5](sbe2611.htm#fr_170) \'Aru _n_ a;\' the Ka _n_ va text adds, \'for that one\nnearest to it (the brown one, or Soma-cow proper) in appearance.\'\n\n[63:1](sbe2611.htm#fr_171) \'Akar _n_ a;\' the Ka _n_ va text has \'anuparsh _t_\nakar _n_ a (one whose ears are not perforated?),\' and instead of \'alakshita\n(not specially marked),\' it reads \'a _s_ ro _n_ a (a _s_ lo _n_ a), not lame.\'\n\n[63:2](sbe2611.htm#fr_172) That is, with one hoof undivided (seven-toed).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 2.
