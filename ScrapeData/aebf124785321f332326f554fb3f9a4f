Apart fromImportance of B _ri_ haspati. their\nintrinsic value and interest, as containing a very full exposition of the\nwhole range of the Hindu law, their close connexion with the Code of Manu\ngives them a special claim to consideration, and renders them a valuable link\nin the chain of evidence 1 by which the date of the most authoritative code of\nancient India has been approximately determined 2.\n\nThe connexion between the Manu and B _ri_ haspati Sm _ri_ tis appears first\nfrom the way in which B _ri_ haspati refers to,He refers to Manu. and quotes\nfrom, the Code of Manu. In the chapter on Gambling and Betting, B _ri_ haspati\nsays (XXVI, I), 'Gambling has been prohibited by Manu, because it destroys\ntruth, honesty, and wealth. It has been permitted by others, when conducted so\nas to allow the king a share (of every stake).' The observation that Manu\ndisagrees with the other legislators as to the permissibility of gambling is\nperfectly just. See Manu IX, 221-228; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 199-203;\n\xc3\x82pastamba II, 25, 12, 13; Narada XVII, 1-8; Katyayana XXV, 1. B _ri_ haspati\ngoes on to say (XXVI, 2) that 'Gambling shall take place under the\nsuperintendence of keepers of gaming-houses, for the purpose of discovering\nthieves.' This rule agrees almost literally with Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 203,\nand the fact that B _ri_ haspati does not refer to Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya by name,\nalthough he names Manu, can only be accounted for by his very particular\nveneration for the latter, as the fountain-head of Sacred Law.\xc2\x97On the\n\np. 272\n\nsubject of weights or coins, B _ri_ haspati says (X, 10), 'The quantities\nbeginning with a floating particle of dust and ending with a Karshapa _n_ a\nhave been declared by Manu.' The statements of Manu which are thus referred to\nby B _ri_ haspati may be found, Manu VIII, 132-137.\xc2\x97In speaking of the Niyoga\nor appointment of a widow to raise offspring to her deceased husband, B _ri_\nhaspati says (XXIV, 12), 'The Niyoga has been declared by Manu, and again\nprohibited by the same; on account of the successive deterioration of the\n(four) ages of the world, it must not take place (in the present or Kali\nage).' This text shows that the conflicting statements of Manu (IX, 57-68)\nwith regard to the Niyoga, which have been the matter of so much comment among\nEuropean philologists, had already struck his follower B _ri_ haspati, and\nwere ingeniously explained by him, in accordance with the practice of his own\ntimes.\xc2\x97In the chapter on Inheritance (XXV, 33), B _ri_ haspati observes that\nout of the thirteen sons declared by Manu, a legitimate son of the body\n(aurasa) and an appointed daughter (putrika) are the only ones that represent\nreal issue. It is true that Manu (IX, 158, 180) speaks emphatically of twelve\nsons only, but the appointed daughter or her son is not among these, and he\nadvocates in strong terms the rights of an appointed daughter's son (IX,\n127-140), and cuts down very much the rights of all the other substitutes for\na son (IX, 180, 181). This shows that B _ri_ haspati's rules on this head are\nperfectly in keeping with the teaching of Manu.\xc2\x97In the chapter on Sale without\nOwnership (XIII, 1) he refers to Manu (VIII, 197) by the name of Bh _ri_ gu.\n\nSecondly, in a number of other instances, the Code of Manu, though not\nappealed to by name, is neverthelessIndirect references. distinctly referred\nto by B _ri_ haspati. Thus, in the chapter on Inheritance (XXV, 79), he\nobserves that 'those by whom clothes and so forth have been declared\nimpartible have not decided properly.' The well-known versus memorialis\nconcerning impartible property, the contents of which are further discussed in\nthe sequel by B _ri_ haspati, occurs both in the Code of Manu (IX, 219) and\n\np. 273\n\nin the Vish _n_ u-sm _ri_ ti; and it may be presumed either that the authors\nof these two works are the authorities referred to by B _ri_ haspati, or that\nManu is referred to in the pluralis majestatis, as is often the case with\nteachers. The reason why Manu is not referred to by name may be sought in the\nfact that B _ri_ haspati does not care to openly avow his dissent from so\neminent an authority.\xc2\x97In the chapter on Debts, B _ri_ haspati remarks (XI, 4)\nthat interest is divided into four species by some, into five by others, and\nby others again into six sorts. Four sorts of interest are mentioned by Manu,\nVIII, 153.\xc2\x97In the chapter on Inheritance (XXV, 35), he declares that an\nappointed daughter or her son has been pronounced equal to a legitimate son of\nthe body. The rights of an appointed daughter, as shown before, are laid great\nstress upon by Manu, and he actually states that an (appointed) daughter is\nequal to a son (IX, 130).\n\nThirdly, B _ri_ haspati, even when not expressly referring to Manu,\npresupposes throughout an acquaintance with Comments on Manu.his Code, and a\nvery large portion of his Sm _ri_ ti is devoted to the interpretation of\ntechnical terms or to the elucidation or amplification of the somewhat laconic\nenunciations of Manu. Thus, for example, in the chapter on Debts (XI, 5-11),\nhe explains, comments on, and amplifies the four sorts of interest mentioned\nby Manu (VIII, 153). In the same chapter (XI, 55-58) he interprets the curious\nterms used by Manu (VIII, 49) to denote the various modes of recovering an\noutstanding debt. In the chapter on Sale without Ownership (XIII, 2), he\nexplains the technical term asvamin, 'another person than the owner,' which\nhad been first used by Manu. From the general maxim of Manu (VIII, 2, 11) that\nthe allotment of shares among partners in any undertaking shall be arranged in\nthe same way as for a company of officiating priests, B _ri_ haspati (XIV,\n20-32) has developed a series of elaborate rules regarding partnership in\ntillage, workmanship, trade, musical performances, and robbery. In the same\nway, the threefold law of breach of promised obedience, non-payment of wages,\nand disputes between the owner of cattle and his servants has been\n\np. 274\n\ndeveloped by B _ri_ haspati (XVI, 1,2) from Manu's two titles of non-payment\nof wages and disputes between master and servant. An analogous course of\ndevelopment may be observed in the chapters on Ordeals, Resumption of Gift,\nand Violation of Agreements, as compared to the scanty provisions of Manu\n(VIII, 114-116, 212-214, 218-221) on the same subjects. In the chapter on\nBoundary Disputes, Manu's technical term maula, 'an original inhabitant of a\nplace,' is interpreted by B _ri_ haspati (XIX, 12). It would be easy to\nmultiply examples. One more analogy between the Manu and B _ri_ haspati Sm\n_ri_ tis seems to be specially deserving of notice. Both agree in arranging\nthe whole field of legal controversies under eighteen heads, and it appears\nfrom the introductory verses to several chapters (XII, I; XIII, 1; XV, 1; XVI,\n1; XVII, 1, &c.) that B _ri_ haspati was anxious to discuss the eighteen\ntitles of law in the same order as Manu. Nevertheless, he applies an\ninteresting new principle of division to the eighteen titles of law by\ndistinguishing fourteen titles relating to civil law, and four titles relating\nto criminal law (II, 3-9), and introduces a number of subdivisions (II, 2, 10;\nXVI, 1-3; XXII, 1, 2).\n\nFourthly, B _ri_ haspati declares emphatically that any Sm _ri_ ti text\nopposed to the teaching of Manu has no validity (XXVII, 4).\n\nUnder these circumstances the tradition preserved in the Skanda-pura _n_ a\nthat there are four versions of the Code of Result.Manu, by Bh _ri_ gu,\nNarada, B _ri_ haspati, and A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, acquires a peculiar significance. Taking\nthe version attributed to Bh _ri_ gu to be identical with the Code of Manu,\nthe soi-disant composition of Bh _ri_ gu, it is impossible to doubt its\nconnexion with the Narada. 1 and B _ri_ haspati Sm _ri_ tis. It is but natural\nto find, therefore, that Narada and B _ri_ haspati agree very closely inter\nse, as e.g. in adding a title called 'Miscellaneous' to Manu's eighteen titles\nof law (B _ri_ haspati XXVII, 1), in enumerating and describing three sorts of\nproof, eleven or twelve kinds of witnesses, eight or ten 'members of a\nlawsuit,' four parts of a judicial proceeding, four sorts of answer in a suit,\n\np. 275\n\nvarious 'defects of a plaint,' three kinds of officiating priests, four\nspecies of gifts, four divisions of violence (sahasa), five modes of recovery\nof a debt, &c. Many other analogies between the two works may be gathered from\na mere cursory comparison of their contents; they agree particularly in the\nuse of many technical terms. One of these, the designation of a gold coin by\nthe Roman or Greek term dinara, i.e. denarius (X, 15), is an important test\nfor the date of both works, and compels us to refer the earlier date of the\ncomposition of B _ri_ haspati's law-book to the first century A.D., the period\nto which belong the earliest Indian coins corresponding in weight to the gold\ndenarius of the Romans 1. As regards the lower limit, one might feel inclined\nto assign an earlier date to B _ri_ haspati than to Narada, on the ground of\nhis being a faithful follower of Manu in a far higher degree than is Narada,\nwho differs from Manu on such important points as the names and order of\nseveral titles of law, the legitimacy of the Niyoga, &c. 2 Nevertheless, the\nenlightened views of B _ri_ haspati on the subject of women's rights 3, and\nthe advanced character of his teaching generally, render it probable that his\nlearned composition belongs to a somewhat more recent period than the Narada-\nsm _ri_ ti.\n\nThe fact that B _ri_ haspati was considered an inspired writer by the very\nearliest commentators of law-books, such as e.g. by Medhatithi (ninth\ncentury), proves him to have preceded those commentators by several centuries.\nAn analogous result may be obtained by comparing the laws of B _ri_ haspati\nwith the corresponding portions of the Burmese The Dhammathats.Dhammathats,\nthe Buddhist Indian originals of which, according to Dr. Forchhammer, were\ncomposed in the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries. The coincidences between\nB _ri_ haspati and the Dhammathats are both numerous and striking 4. It may be\nadded that\n\np. 276\n\nthe judicial proceeding described in the well-known drama M _ri_ _k_ _kh_ aka\n_t_ ika corresponds to the rules laid down by B _ri_ haspati, as has been\nshown elsewhere. For all these reasons, the composition of the B _ri_ haspati-\nsm _ri_ ti cannot be referred to a later period than the sixth or seventh\ncentury A.D.\n\nHitherto, those texts of B _ri_ haspati have been entirely left aside which\nrelate to other parts of the sacred law than Civil Religious texts.and\nCriminal Law and Procedure. Hemadri's _K_ aturvarga _k_ intama _n_ i, Deva _n_\n_d_ abha _t_ _t_ a's Sm _ri_ ti _k_ andrika, and most other standard\nDharmanibandhas contain a number of texts of B _ri_ haspati on Dana, Vrata,\nPraya _s_ _k_ itta, and all other parts of the religious law. However, an\nexamination of these texts has yielded no definite result, and they are not\nsufficiently numerous by far to admit of reconstructing the purely religious\nportion of the ancient B _ri_ haspati-sm _ri_ ti from them. Nor is it at all\nimprobable that the legal texts of B _ri_ haspati may have formed an\nindependent work from the outset, just like the Narada-sm _ri_ ti, or like the\nBurmese Dhammathats, in which forensic law was treated by itself, without any\nadmixture of religious elements.\n\nThe legal texts attributed to B _ri_ haspati are so numerous as to make up in\ntheir entirety a law-book which contains a Arrangement.full exposition of\nforensic law, hardly inferior in size to the Narada-sm _ri_ ti. The principles\non which the texts have been collected and arranged are the same as in the\ncase of the Quotations from Narada. The preservation of the introductory texts\nto several titles of law, and the occurrence of many long series of\nconsecutive texts of B _ri_ haspati in the Dharmanibandhas, facilitate\nconsiderably the task of arrangement, though the original position of many\ntexts in B _ri_ haspati's Dharma _s_ astra must needs remain doubtful. For the\nchapter on Inheritance the following other works have been used, besides those\nconsulted for the Quotations from Narada: G. Sarkar's translation of the\nViramitrodaya on Inheritance (V.); Dr. Burnell's Madhaviya and Varadara _g_ a;\nProfessor Baler's edition of the U _g_ _g_ vala of Haradatta; Haradatta's\nGautamiya Mitakshara (MS.); Nandapa _n_ _d_ ita's Vai _g_ ayanti (MS.).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[271:1](sbe3358.htm#fr_843) Buhler, The Laws of Manu (Sacred Books of the\nEast, vol. xxv), pp. cviii\xc2\x96cx.\n\n[271:2](sbe3358.htm#fr_844) What follows up to p. 275 has been reprinted, with\nmodifications and additions, from a paper on 'Manu and B _ri_ haspati,' in the\nfirst volume of the Vienna Zeitschrift f. d.
