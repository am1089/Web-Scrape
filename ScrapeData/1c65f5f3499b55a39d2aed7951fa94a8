Charm to repel sorceries or spells.\n\n1\\. An eagle found thee out, a boar dug thee out with his snout. Seek thou, O\nplant, to injure him that seeks to injure (us), strike down him that prepares\nspells (against us'!  \n2\\. Strike down the wizards, strike down him that prepares spells (against\nus); slay thou, moreover, O plant, him that seeks to injure us!  \n3\\. Cutting out from the skin (of the enemy) as if (from the skin) of an\nantelope, do ye, O gods, fasten the spell upon him that prepares it, as (one\nfastens) an ornament!  \n4\\. Take hold by the hand and lead away the spell back to him that prepares\nit! Place it in his very presence, so that it shall slay him that prepares the\nspell!  \n5\\. The spells shall take effect upon him that prepares the spells, the curse\nupon him that pronounces the curse! As a chariot with easy-going wheels, the\nspell shall turn back upon him that prepares the spell!  \n6\\. Whether a woman, or whether a man has prepared the spell for evil, we lead\nthat spell to him as a horse with the halter.  \n7\\. Whether thou hast been prepared by the gods, or hast been prepared by men,\nwe lead thee back with the help of Indra as an ally.  \n8\\. O Agni gainer of battles, do thou gain the battles! With a counter-charm\ndo we hurl back the spell upon him that prepares the spell.  \n9\\. Hold ready, (O plant,) thy weapon, and strike him, slay the very one that\nhas prepared (the spell)! We do not whet thee for the destruction of him that\nhas not practised (spells).  \n10\\. Go as a son to his father, bite like an adder that has been stepped upon.\nReturn thou, O spell, to him that prepares the spell, as one who overcomes his\nfetters!  \n11\\. As the shy deer, the antelope, goes out to the mating (buck), thus the\nspell shall reach him that prepares it!  \n12\\. Straighter than an arrow may it (the spell) fly against him, O ye heaven\nand earth; may that spell take hold again of him that prepares it, as (a\nhunter)  \nof his game!  \n13\\. Like fire (the spell) shall progress in the teeth of obstacles, like\nwater along its course! As a chariot with easy-going wheels the spell shall\nturn back upon him that prepares the spell!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 5.
