The nymph obeyed;  \nIn all her loveliest charms arrayed,  \nWith winning ways and witching smile  \nShe sought the hermit to beguile.  \nThe sweet note of that tuneful bird  \nThe saint with ravished bosom heard,  \nAnd on his heart a rapture passed  \nAs on the nymph a look he cast.  \nBut when he heard the bird prolong  \nHis sweet incomparable song,  \nAnd saw the nymph with winning smile,  \nThe hermit's heart perceiv'd the wile.  \nAnd straight he knew the Thousand-eyed  \nA plot against his peace had tried.  \nThen Kus'ik's son indignant laid  \nHis curse upon the heavenly maid:  \n'Because thou wouldst my soul engage  \nWho fight to conquer love and rage,  \nStand, till ten thousand years have flown,  \nIll-fated maid, transformed to stone.  \nA Brahman then, in glory strong,  \nMighty through penance stern and long,  \nShall free thee from thine altered shape;  \nThou from my curse shalt then escape.'  \nBut when the saint had cursed her so,  \nHis breast was burnt with fires of woe,  \nGrieved that long effort to restrain  \nHis mighty wrath was all in vain.  \nCursed by the angry sage's power,  \nShe stood in stone that selfsame hour.  \nKandarpa heard the words he said,  \nAnd quickly from his presence fled.  \nHis fall beneath his passion's sway  \nHad reft the hermit's meed away.  \nUnconquered yet his secret foes,  \nThe humbled saint refused repose:  \n'No more shall rage my bosom till,  \nSealed be my lips, my tongue be still.  \nMy very breath henceforth I hold  \nUntil a thousand years are told:  \nVictorious o'er each erring sense,  \nI'll dry my frame with abstinence,  \nUntil by penance duly done  \nA Brahman's rank be bought and won.  \nFor countless yearn, as still as death.  \nI taste no food, I draw no breath,  \nAnd as I toil my frame shall stand  \nUnharmed by time's destroying hand.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXV.: Vis'vamitra's Triumph](ry065.htm)\n\n"
