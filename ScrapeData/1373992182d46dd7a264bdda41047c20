In music, the melody of the _Sama\nVeda_ is the sweetest, In meditation that of Siva is the noblest.\n\n1002\n\nBurn him, Burn him, cries Pluto. This is more talking like a magpie. He cannot\nsee what the truth is (that he is himself but a component part of creation).\nThey who participate in the deity cannot themselves see god.\n\n1003\n\nLet us adore and glorify the (Pranalinga) prime spirit. But for what offence\ndo ye bind it about your neck. Joy (i.e., the deity) is a witness to us of\nthis folly.\n\n1004\n\nWearing ashes of things that are bhavi (i.e., not lingamite) he calls this a\nform of Siva devoid of shame. But surely all animals are gifted with the\nlinga. (Ye are as proud as a dog with two).\n\n1005\n\nStupid fools are they who hide their wealth in the earth, and again dress\ntheir food in the earthen vessel of the body. Why should ye be so foolish for\nthis muddy life?\n\np. 242\n\n1006\n\nTo the whole of the Siva sect, Hari is Teacher (by a refined explanation) and\nHara (Siva) is Teacher, to the Hari creed. What sort of teacher is the wretch\nvoid of qualities of excellence.\n\n1007\n\nHe that is unborn (Aja, Brahma) shines betwixt Vishnu and Siva, and in the\nmidst of these does the _yoni_ shine; It possesses a peculiar _kala_ which\nhowever is unperceptible.\n\n1008\n\nWhen one life is past the fool shall again be born; again shall he love and\nagain feel affection; again shall he roam the countries and villages like to a\nhomeless monkey.\n\n1009\n\nHow long does the soul, unprotected continue to die and be born again\nnaturally (sahaja is born with us). To live without forgetting him is\nperfection,\n\n1010\n\np. 248\n\nWhen all those who talk of the high deity as in unity, are freed from the\nbody, then shall they be secure from sorrow and sin and enjoy happiness.\n\n1011\n\nTo know the nature of the fluctuating and that of the changeless, is in the\npower of astrologers; who can inspect the body? Like as the swan is said to\ndiscriminate between water and milk.\n\n1012\n\nIn the five faces of Siva the five letters (na-ma-si-va-ya) produced; by them\nis the world supported. Then how is it that they fail to praise the Five\nFaced.\n\n1013\n\nThe Goddess of Earth as they call her is clay, seeing that all men know how\nthat [Goddess](errata.htm#183) was produced, she became very weighty, They\neven call that Goddess equal to Siva as sustaining all.\n\n1014\n\nLime is the best of all matters. Lime displays the present world in the earth,\nand it also shows us heaven.\n\np. 244\n\n1015\n\nIf thy good acts be great they shall not pass away; alas surely fate in a\nfitting place changed Dharmaraj into Kanku Bhattu.\n\n1016\n\nHe puts his gift into the hand and pours the water of donation; thus doth he\nmake fitting benefactions; but knows not that he and that of his neighbours\nare one. (Each is a form of Eswara.)\n\n1017\n\nThey muse on the mantras but know not their meaning; ignorant of that\nsignification they become blind. To become reborn and great let him learn it\nfrom the Teacher.\n\n1018\n\nMaya, that is, Vishnu--is there any other to whom the name applies? \'Cupid\' is\nthe dear son (son of kisses) of Maya; in Maya do his powers originate.\n\n1019\n\np. 245\n\nVishnu, he who hath a burnt body, he, Siva with the burnt throat, Brahma who\nsmeareth over his body--these are allies. When the three thus meet it is a joy\nto the world.\n\n1020\n\nLet us not trust him who walks in another path; consider even his vest as a\nspecies of evil. It is the form of Ravanasura well known.\n\n1021\n\nGadheyudu (Viswamitra, son of Gadhi) formed a world in imitation of that\nformed by Brahma and unable to know the truth gained (he gained only his\npain). Doth the angry man know himself?\n\n1022\n\nDo not Siva (Shambhudu) slay and restore his son Viswamitra to life. Did not\nVishnu revive his son Manmatha? The Vedas give numberless meanings of these\nstories.\n\n1023\n\np. 246\n\nA thousand and thousands of the leaders of fishes who caused the Vedas\n(nigama) to float on the sea, to churn nectar beneath that hill did he place\nthree thousand firm tortoises, a thousand tens of Krishnas to see the\nshepherdesses in the shepherds\' hamlet, four thousands of Narasimha\nincarnations to tear the breast of the Rakshasas, to slay Ravanasura, ten\nthousand Ramas, Parasuramas, ten thousand--if thou ask where is Siva, He who\nin the form of Vishnu underwent the incarnations. He dwelleth in Kasi.\n\n1024\n\nIf the teachers be ruined is not the whole caste destroyed? If Brahmins be\ndestroyed he shall turn to ashes. If thou destroy Hara and Hari far is\nbeatitude from thee.\n\n1025\n\nOur limbs to the God of fire, the bones, when burnt to the Goddess of earth,\nthe excess of wealth to the kings, the entire soul to lovers, stubbornness to\nfools--the Sankara Vismriti to pariars and to the great avenger (Pluto) wrath\nbelong.\n\np. 247\n\n1026\n\nIn whatever direction each man\'s desire is, in proportion to his desire, shall\nVema cause them to attain the blessings of this and the next world. By the\nfavour of Siva shalt thou render them acceptable, O Vema.\n\n1027\n\nThey think on the mantras, but know not their meaning. How are those twice\nborn who are ignorant of the meaning. He who comprehends the signification\nthis is the only Bramha Rishi.\n\n1028\n\nThe wild melon leaf is still more poisonous than the margosa. The heretical\nprathama shakhi (sectory) is more venomous than a serpent and a black\ncomplexioned Brahmin is worse poison than musk.\n\n1029\n\nBy not quitting the assertions (violence) of the eight creeds, the holy have\nall become ruined. If you hold dung in your hand why cleanse it externally.\n\n1030\n\np. 248\n\nSoul and the divinity exist in full force in the (diverse) forms that are in\nthis world. But the Jangams, ignorant of this, cannot find the path.\n\n1031\n\nWhat means "Bramin", what means "devotee", what means "enjoyer", what means\ndonor--however diverse their names, Plato\'s realm is their portion.\n\n1032\n\nThose of the Bouddha sect consider the intellect to be the divinity. They\nreckon, with degraded minds which is highest and which lowest. They have left\nof discriminating both good and bad, the vile calves.\n\n1033\n\nThe unholy wretch who joins the skull-sect is ignorant of the beginning and\nthe end of life; and in folly reviles Siva, alas he is ruined, (This sect is\natheistical and epicurean. They deny both creation and destruction.)\n\n1034\n\nLikewise, by the Shacta creed, men consider power to be the divinity and, void\nof all sense (fitness) they fully perform the rites of pariar generations.\n\np. 249\n\n1035\n\nWhat sort of caste is that of Rishies? Enquire and know; they became lovers of\nGod. They became the divinity. Finally however great they be they are devoured\nby the funeral flame.\n\n1036\n\nBorn in the _rishi_ tribe, thereafter they are exalted in the _gotra_ (tribe).\nThey are not descended from Brahma, how then should they be Brahmins?\n\n1037\n\nThose sinful ones who undertake to walk in luxury eating and resting, and hard\nconduct--these shall not escape being bound in hell and cast into the mills of\nYama.\n\n1038\n\nThe life we enjoy shall not pass in all one manner; wealth and poverty await\nus all in this iron age; even Hari, Hara and Aja look upon evil and good as\none.\n\n1039\n\np. 249\n\nHolding Siva the Lord, the body to be his temple, and attaining rest, he who\nuniteth his soul with Siva, this is the Siva-yogi.\n\n1040\n\nBrahma has given wealth to one man and a liberal disposition in the mind to\nanother. May Brahma perish and his wife\'s marriage cord be broken at the\nwharf.\n\n1041\n\nOn the day when the term expired, it is impossible even for the three (Gods)\nto continue without suffering death. Why do ye dread the limit? Is the life\neternal? It is brief, O Vema!\n\n1042\n\nWhy did Brahma bestow a delightful odour in a ball of ashes; what fault\n(falsehood) had gold committed before him? Let the widow of Brahma have her\ncord broken at the wharf.\n\n1043\n\nHe made the waters of the sea salt. He made the man of wealth avaricious. The\nacts of Brahma are acts of ashes.\n\n1044\n\np. 251\n\nBeholding the craft of women, Bhairu Siva (Dog headed) refrained from\n[marriage](errata.htm#184). So did the Big-bellied. Anjaneya (Hanuman) from\nhis birth bound his _langoti_ tight.\n\n1045\n\nTime and fate are boundless. Let us not oppose them but conduct ourselves as\nthey lead us here on earth. Leave Brahma (Vidhi) in his eternal sleep and\ndream. O! ye idiots all! walk; O! men in the ways of beatitude.\n\n1046\n\nWhile you perform the worship of the shakti (inferior Goddesses) how should\nthe Savitri (holy verse, Gayatri) continue on the earth? Sin is produced. Do\nnot seize and punish it.\n\n1047\n\nIf a noble person comes and kills a cow, his crime-can by no means be evaded,\nand at last, he is surely to Yama as a goat bound for sacrifice.\n\n1048\n\nThe sun and the moon are present. The wind, fire and peacock spangled.\nDivinities are before thee. The earth and air are present. So many divinities\nare before thee. If thou wilt require, O Vema!\n\np. 252\n\n1049\n\nWhy marry? Why beget children? Why suffer this sorrow? It is madness! Like as\nthough a man lifted a rock upon his head.\n\n1050\n\nThe Divinity Himself became the universe. and was born when he hungers he\nshall eat this universe with desire (lit, its noble juice), In contradiction\nto his former acts he shall devour and destroy it. Alas! what do they call\nthis?\n\n1051\n\nThe Deity became man, he became woman leaving sorrow and having those desires\nthat never relinquish in each age he is born. O ye wise! behold this noble\nobject of meditation.\n\n1052\n\nIn the various tribes of animals the deity was repeatedly\n[reborn](errata.htm#185); like as if confused he roamed and roved; were we to\ncall this body eternal? Would not the deity laugh?\n\n1053\n\np. 253\n\nWho is the living man? Who is he who bore him? Who is the dead? No one knows\nthis course! He that is, who produceth, who dieth, is one divinity.\n\n1054\n\nUnited with every living creature, manifest is the deity within them. Consider\nthis deity carefully, whether it is female or male?\n\n1055\n\nBorn, he existeth, unborn he existeth not, awhile he dieth; awhile lives\nagain, This is the mere diceplay of Brahma! Nothing is stable!\n\n1056\n\nWhy first are we born? Why die at last? Why troubled by reason of the ruthless\nYama? Restrain thy mind from longing for birth.\n\n1057\n\nHowever great he be, to let the great sinner duly attain salvation there is\none expedient at the time of death; let him give up all his desires, and think\non God. Thus shall he become beatified.\n\np. 254\n\n1058\n\nThough you impress his image on thee or name thyself his son, or eat his betel\nspittle serving him abjectly, shall any thing be attained by thee beyond thy\ndestiny?\n\n1059\n\nEntangled in vain desires, observing the lives of consanguinity, a man becomes\nmad and roams the world. Where are our fathers and mothers? What are they? and\nwhat do they for us? (lit. why they to us?)\n\n1060\n\nThe hill monkey has (if you look) the monkey for a (p\xc4\x93rant\xc4\x81lu) wife; a banda\n(a poor king) for a minister; (Banda--a [beggar](errata.htm#186) who tortures\nhimself to [extort](errata.htm#187) alms from fools). Look at the Banda;\nvillainous slanderers are his kin.\n\n1061\n\nIgnorant of the term set to the expenditure of life, it is fit for no one to\nwrite or cause to write at any time or in any place never write.\n\n(This folly signifies that what is rendered permanent by writing may become\nfalse.)\n\np. 255\n\n1062\n\nHe who duly reverences Bramins and the Gods, who justly governs the earth, and\nthus gains wealth, which he spends in liberality, he, thus looking to the path\nto the beatitude, and has love to God. This is a king!\n\n1063\n\nConsider the spittle (leavings) of flies, of courtesans--they are acceptable\nto men and gods. Then why is our own spittle unacceptable to us?\n\n1064\n\nAll wealth that is buried falls to the share of the earth; all that is out\nfalls into the hands of others; all that we eat is the gain merely of\nstraining inner system; what is bestowed alone remains ours.\n\n1065\n\nGive or not give, hope will bestow; however unsuccessful we still hope. Give\nor not give, it gives the world. Examine and see this. In this there are no\nfree agents.\n\np. 256\n\n1066\n\nBecoming a foetus it will remain in the womb for a few days. Thereafter it\nwill surely not remain. The foetus is born in the earth; the foetus is the\nprotection of the spirit in the earth, O Vema!\n\n1067\n\nFoulness in the belly, masses of flesh, bones--if you view it there is but a\nfilthy skin over it. What manner of dwelling is this? What manner of comfort\nis this?\n\n1068\n\nIf we eat not [food](errata.htm#188), the fire in the belly devours the\nimpurities of the belly. Thus if he abstain from food, he who fasteth\ndevoureth impurity.\n\n1069\n\nIf the _Carnam_ be a low fellow, the farmers will all join and tell him to bow\ndown whenever they have a mind. But if the _Carnam_ be firm, we are your\nchildren, say they.\n\np. 257\n\n1070\n\nA cat that listens a squeak is annoyed, if while eating its food it sees one\nof its own species (caste). He that hath no caste is considered a god in the\nworld (as impartial).\n\n1071\n\nA fellow on one leg is no saint. If one carries cow-dung she is no slut, if\none sees either of these he is merely astonished (his eyes redden).\n\n1072\n\nIn the Linga sect, a set of hypocrites has arisen and these having handsomely\nreviled one another are all turned to dust by the Turk tribe to whom their\ndiscussion render them easy converts.\n\n1073\n\nA man is distinguished in the world, and becoming himself a great _somayaji_\nis born, a brother to the village god Potarazu. But you may consider him as\nmerely the vile goddess of death to the rams that are sacrificed.\n\n1074\n\nHe who saith this (external) figure is thy form and beholdeth in his internal\nimage, Him that is worthy to be wore slipped of all worlds. In that form in\nwhich he himself exists shall he behold the Lord.\n\np. 258\n\n1075\n\nHe that hath not subdued (slain) his mind as we still further consider, is\nlower than a pariar, O man! death (naraka) shall befall (lit. come to) him\nafter death.\n\n1076\n\nThe chariot has five linch-pins; when the charioteer propels, the car\nproceeds. The car of thy body has five linch pins the senses); seek him who\nevidently guides it.\n\n1077\n\nThose wretches (lives) that artfully destroy animals while either sleeping,\ndrinking waters or standing still and singing shall at the end in the same\nmanner perish.\n\n1078\n\nBecoming free thinkers and ruined just like crows roaming the land wandering\nwithout understanding in them, they devour dung and urine; they die and become\na part of earth.\n\n1079\n\np. 259\n\nThat house that we call the body do we daily sweep, smear with cow-dung,\nplaster, and order; at last we quit it and depart, so deceitful (or fleeting)\nis the soul.\n\n1080\n\nTo what end is all this reading, to what end are all these disputations? If\nthou wouldest remain of one mind, thou shouldest become an accomplished sage\nand attaining absorptions become thyself, the Universe.\n\n1081\n\nSurely these vile tenets (Veda) are mere contention. The words of Vemana are\nknowledge (Veda). Verify none can show you any good. Though good were taught,\nyou would not do it. If a man did well this would be the perfect man.\n\n( ![](img/25900.jpg) is a vocative plural of which  ![](img/25901.jpg) is the\nsingular. )\n\n1082\n\nLike as camphor, burnt in fire loses its fine smelt. Thus the fragrance of\nwisdom in the debased can attain no nobility.\n\n1083\n\np. 260\n\nHe who knows the truth knows the Divinity and this will enable him to slay all\nhis lust (literally vigours). Will he who has swallowed a delicious plantain\nswallow venom?\n\n1084\n\nWonderful is it that the millions of animated beings should behold the great\nspirit, if thou consider in thy heart.\n\n1085\n\nSorrow originates in impurity of heart. Like as the sun shines on all nature,\npure water is in the sanctified body.\n\n1086\n\nYe who [first](errata.htm#189) drove away all your original Gods, ye who drove\naway the succeeding deities, smite with the slipper your present paltry\ndivinities.\n\n1087\n\nHe who has beheld all the glory that is concealed within the veil, and has\nalso fixed his mind on the divinity, that mighty saint who existeth in exalted\nholiness, at where shall we seek him?\n\np. 261\n\n1088\n\nTo know myself is to know thee How should he who knoweth not himself know\nthee. Let us learn from Boya Caannappa the prayer that teaches a knowledge of\n[ourselves](errata.htm#190) and thee (easy and useful in grammatical\n[construction](errata.htm#191)).\n\n1089\n\nThat deity that alone comprehendeth the scriptures is found by constant\nseeking The Lord seeketh the man that seeketh him. Are there any who are wise\nand have learnt to seek him?\n\n1090\n\nIf we love him, he will love us. If we love not him he will not love us (in\nthe world). All our gorgeous apparel any our devils are all of no avail in the\nworld.\n\n1091\n\nWithout self possession the mere favour of learning will never remove the\ndoubts of the aspirant. No more than darkness will be dissipated by a painted\nflame.\n\np. 262\n\n1092\n\nBy gentleness every object is pleasantly attained. It is a true victory; by it\nour vows are performed, I will lay you any bet. How great were the\ndifficulties that Dharmaraj conquered by means of gentleness? (admirable and\neasy),\n\n1093\n\nWhen the men of this world see the exalted saint they will censure him but\ncannot comprehend him. What difference can the hand perceive between nectar\nand any other taste.\n\n1094\n\nFrom his birth onwards how many diverse evil thoughts the sinner entertains.\nLike to a lame dog that is in imagination eating meat.\n\n1095\n\nIf he have learnt to speak prudently (lit. knowing abstracts), why should we\nconsider his youth or age? May not a letter written by a child be respectable?\n\n1096\n\np. 263\n\n[Continuing](errata.htm#192) to live and see (as in houses), listening to\nmodes contrary to sense, do men pass away like an old song, listening to this\nthey go on and go on and become a tale.\n\n1097\n\nAs they who have lost their eyes or legs seek each others aid, and as the\nbeggar unites with beggar alone. Thus wealth and poverty associate together.\n\n1098\n\nIs not the dying of some of our kin before our eyes an evidence/to us? Can we\nlook upon our frail lives as eternal?\n\n1099\n\nLike as the lamp of the sun enters into water, thus does the eye behold the\ndeity. Like as the glistening of the soil of the desert in the mirage.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 1100-1199](vov13.htm)\n\n'
