When\npoured forth, it weighed down the _ri_ _k_ (hymn-verse) and the saman (hymn-\ntune). The Vai _s_ vadeva (offerings) upheld that (A _s_ vamedha): thus, when\nhe offers the Vai _s_ vadevas, it is for the upholding of the A _s_ vamedha.\n\n13:1:8:22\\. With (Va _g_. S. XXII, 20), 'To Ka hail! To the Who hail! To the\nWhoever hail!' he makes the one relating to Pra _g_ apati the first (or chief\none), and thus upholds (the A _s_ vamedha) by means of the deities with Pra\n_g_ apati as their chief.\n\n13:1:8:33\\. 'Hail, meditation (we give) unto him meditated upon! Hail, the\nmind unto the Lord of creatures! Hail, thought unto him, the known 3!' what\nthe mystic sense of the former (utterances 4) was that it is here.\n\np. 293\n\n13:1:8:44\\. 'To Aditi hail! To Aditi, the mighty, hail! To Aditi, the most\nmerciful, hail!' Aditi, doubtless, is this (earth): it is by her that he\nupholds it.\n\n13:1:8:55\\. 'To Sarasvati hail! To Sarasvati, the pure, hail! To Sarasvati,\nthe great, hail!' Sarasvati, doubtless, is speech: by speech he thus upholds\nit.\n\n13:1:8:66\\. 'To Pushan hail! To Pushan, the protector of travellers, hail! To\nPushan, the watcher of men, hail!' Pushan, doubtless, is cattle: by means of\ncattle he thus upholds it.\n\n13:1:8:77\\. 'To Tvash _t_ _ri_ hail! To Tvash _t_ _ri_ , the seminal, hail! To\nTvash _t_ _ri_ , the multiform hail!' Tvash _t_ _ri_ , doubtless, is the\nfashioner of the couples of animals: by means of forms he thus upholds it.\n\n13:1:8:88\\. 'To Vish _n_ u hail! To Vish _n_ u, the protector of what grows 1,\nhail! To Vish _n_ u, the bald 2, hail!' Vish _n_ u, doubtless, is the\nsacrifice: by sacrifice he thus upholds it. With (Va _g_. XXII, 21), 'Let\nevery mortal espouse the friendship of the divine guide, . . . 3,' he offers\nlast of all a full (-spoon)-oblation; for the full-offering is this (earth):\nhe thus finally establishes himself on this (earth).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[292:2](sbe44081.htm#fr_737) See [p. 289](sbe44079.htm#page_289), note\n[1](sbe44080.htm#fn_726). It is here taken to be represented by the Ya _g_\nus:--a _s_ vamedha _m_ ya _g_ uratmakavigrahavanta _m_ s _ri_ sh _t_ avan,\nHarisv.--the larger number of sacrificial formulas used at the performances\nbeing too heavy for the recited and chanted texts.\n\n[292:3](sbe44081.htm#fr_738) Mahidhara takes 'adhim adhitaya' in the sense of\n'adhana _m_ praptaya' (who has obtained a consecrated fire); and 'mana _h_ pra\n_g_ ataye' in the sense of 'manasi vartamanaya p.' (to P. who is in our mind);\nand ' _k_ itta _m_ vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ataya' in the sense of 'sarvesha _m_ _k_\nittasakshi _n_ e' (to the witness, or knower, of all men's thoughts).\n\n[292:4](sbe44081.htm#fr_739) Harisvamin probably is right in supplying 'vyah\n_ri_ tinam;' though possibly 'devatanam' (deities) may be understood.\n\n[293:1](sbe44081.htm#fr_740) The meaning of 'nibhuyapa' is doubtful; Mahidhara\nexplains it by 'nitaram bhutva matsyadyavatara _m_ k _ri_ tva pati.' Perhaps\nit may mean 'condescending protector,' though one expects a direct object with\n'pa.'\n\n[293:2](sbe44081.htm#fr_741) The word ' _s_ ipivish _t_ a,' as applied to Vish\n_n_ u, is likewise of doubtful meaning. The native dictionaries assign both\nthe meaning 'bald' and 'leprous' (or, affected with skin-disease) to it;\nwhilst the first part ' _s_ ipi' is taken variously by commentators as meaning\n'cattle,' or 'ray,' or 'water,' or 'living being.'\n\n[293:3](sbe44081.htm#fr_742) See III, 1, 4, 18; VI, 6, 1, 21; and [p.\n294](sbe44082.htm#page_294), note [1](sbe44082.htm#fn_739).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 1, 9.
