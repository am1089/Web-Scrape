Savitri said :-- \xc2\x93O Dharmarajan! Kindly tell me in detail about those\nworks that lead the meritorious persons to the Heavens and various other\nspheres.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n2-20. Dharmaraj said :-- O Child! He who gives rice and food to the Brahma _n_\nas in India, goes to the S\xc2\x92ivaloka where he dwells with great respect for\nyears equivalent to the measure of that food. This \xc2\x93Anna-dana\xc2\x94 (the giving of\nboiled rice and other eatables) is a great dan (charity) and this can be done\nnot only to the Brahma _n_ as but to the other castes also, where similar\nresults also follow. There is, or will be, no other charity superior to this\ncharity of anna (rice, boiled it may be and other eatables). For here no\ndistinction is made as to what caste will get it or not, nor the\ndiscrimination of time, when to give such a charity. O Child! Seats (\xc3\x82sanas)\ngiven to the Devas and the Brahma _n_ as, carry the donor to the Vi _sn_ u\nLoka, where he dwells for Ayuta years with great respect and love. Giving\nexcellent cows yielding milk to Brahma _n_ as take the donor to Vi _sn_ uloka,\nwhere he is glorified and remains for years equivalent to the number of pores\nin that cow or those cows. And if cows be given on a meritorious day, four\ntimes the merits accrue, and if given in a sacred place of pilgrimage, hundred\ntimes the result occurs; and if given in a tirath, where Naraya _n_ a is\nworshipped, ko _t_ i times the results accrue. He who gives with devotion,\ncows to the Brahma _n_ as in Bharata, remains in the Chandraloka for one Ayuta\nyears and is glorified. He who gives a two-mouthed cow to a Brahma _n_ a, goes\nto Vi _sn_ uloka and remains there for as many years as there exist the\nnumbers of hairs on the body of that cow and is glorified. A gift of a\nbeautiful white umbrella to a Brahma _n_ a makes one go to Varu _n_ aloka for\nAyuta years where he remains with great pleasure. Giving garments to the\ndiseased Brahma _n_ as makes one fit to remain with glory in Vayuloka for one\nayuta years. Giving to a Brahma _n_ a the S\xc2\x92alagrama with garments makes one\nremain with glory in Vaiku _nt_ ha as long as there exist the Sun and Moon.\nGiving a beautiful bedding to a Brahma _n_ a, glorifies a man in the\nChandraloka as long as there exist the Sun and Moon. To give lights to the\nDevas and Brahma _n_ a glorifies a man in Ag _n_ iloka (the region of Fire)\nfor one Manvantara. To give elephants to the Brahma _n_ as in Bharata, makes\none sit in the same throne with Indra for his life period.\n\n\n\np. 919\n\n\n\nGiving horses to the Brahma _n_ as makes one remain in Varu _n_ aloka for\nfourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life periods. Giving a good palanquin to a Brahma _n_ a makes\none remain in the Varu _n_ aloka for fourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life-periods. Giving a\ngood site or a good orchard to a Brahma _n_ a leads one to the Vayuloka where\nhe remains with glory for one Manvantara. Giving a white chamara and fan to a\nBrahma _n_ a, leads the donor to the Vayuloka where he remains for one ayuta\nyears. Giving grains and jewels make one long-lived and both the donors and\nreceivers go certainly to Vaiku _nt_ ha.\n\n\n\n21-40. He who always recites the name of S\xc2\x92ri Hari, lives for ever and Death\ngoes far far away from him. The intelligent man that celebrates the Swinging\nFestival (Dol Jatra) in the last quarter of the Full Moon night in this land\nof Bharata, becomes liberated while living, enjoying pleasures in this world,\ngoes in the end to Vi _sn_ uloka, where he remains for one hundred\nManvantaras; there is no doubt in this. If the Swinging Festival be performed\nunder the influence of the asterism Uttara Phalguni then the fruits become\ndoubled; this is the saying of Brahma Himself. The performer lives to the end\nof a Kalpa. To give til (Sesamum) to a Brahma _n_ , leads one to S\xc2\x92iva Loka,\nwhere one enjoys for a number of years equal to the number of til. Then one is\nborn in a good yoni and becomes longlived and happy. To give a copper plate\nyields double the effect. To give in India a chaste wife with garments and\nornaments to a Brahma _n_ (and then to purchase her with an equivalent in\ngold) leads one to Chandra Loka where one remains for fourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life\nperiods and enjoys day and night the celestial Apsaras. Thence the donor goes\nto the Gandharba Loka for one ayuta years and day and night enjoys Urvas\xc2\x92i.\nThen he gets for thousand births chaste, fortunate, wealthy, gentle and sweet-\nspeaking, beautiful wives. He who gives nice and delicious fruits to the\nBrahma _n_ as, remains with glory in the Indra Loka for a number of years\nequivalent to the fruits. He gets again a good Yoni (birth) and gets excellent\nsons. To give thousand trees while there are fruits on them, or nice fruits\nonly to the Brahma _n_ as, makes one enjoy the Heavens for a long, long time\nand he then comes back to Bharata. To give various things and good edifices\nwith grains, etc., to the Brahma _n_ as leads one to the regions of the Devas\nwhere he remains for one hundred Manvantaras. Then he gets a very good birth\nand becomes the master of abundant wealth. He who gives with devotion to the\nBrahma _n_ as lands certainly goes for one hundred Manvantaras and remains\nthere in glory for one hundred Manvantras; and, coming again to be born in\ngood wombs, they become Kings. The earth does not leave him for hundred\nbirths. He becomes prosperous, wealthy and possesses many sons and\n\n\n\np. 920\n\n\n\nbecomes the lord of his subjects. He who gives a good village with pasture\nland and cows, dwells with glory in Vaiku _nt_ ha for one lakh manvantaras.\nThen he gets a good birth (becomes born in a high caste family) and obtains a\nlakh villages. The earth quits him not even if he be born a lakh times. (This\nis very bad then, to one who does not like to be born again).\n\n\n\n41-60. He who gives a village inhabited by good and obedient subjects with\nripe excellent grains, various tanks, trees and adorned with fruits and leaves\ndwells in Kaila _s_ a with great glory for ten lakh Indra\xc2\x92s life periods.\nGetting again born in a high family, he becomes Raja Dhiraja in Bharata and\nobtains Niyuta towns. There is no doubt in this. The earth quits him not, even\nif he be born ayuta times. Really he gets the highest prosperity in this\nearth. He who gives to a Brahma _n_ a one hundred towns and countries,\ninhabited by good or mediocre subjects, with wells, tanks, and various trees,\nremains with glory in Vaiku _nt_ ha for one ko _t_ i manvantaras. Then he\nbecomes born in this earth in a high caste family, becomes the Lord of\nJambudvipa and attains in this earth great prosperity like Indra. The earth\nquits him not even if he comes here Ko _t_ i times; in reality he is a Mahatma\n(a great soul man), Rajrajes\xc2\x92vara (the Lord of Kings) and lives upto the end\nof a Kalpa. He who gives his whole property to a Brahmi _n_ , gets in the end\nfour times that; there is no doubt in this. He who gives Jambu Dvipa to an\nascetic Brahma _n_ a, gets undoubtedly in the end one hundred times the fruit.\nIf you give away Jambu Dvipa, the whole earth; if you travel all the Tirthas,\nif you perform all sorts of asceticisms, if you give shelter to all, if you\nmake gifts of all sorts, know that you will have to come again to be reborn in\nthis earth; but if you become a devotee of Mula Prakriti, then be sure that\nyou won\xc2\x92t have to come here and be reborn. The devotees of Mula Prakriti go to\nMa _n_ i Dvipa, the highest place of S\xc2\x92ri Bhuvanes\xc2\x92ari Devi and remain there\nand they see the fall of innumerable Brahmas. The worshippers of the Devi\nMantra when they quit their mortal coils, assume divine appearances endowed\nwith Bibhutis (manifestations of powers) and free from birth, death and old\nage, assume the Sarupya (the same form) of the Devi and remain in Her Service.\nThey reside in Ma _n_ idvipa and see the part Pralayas. The Devas die, the\nSiddhas die, the whole universe vanishes; but the Devi Bhaktas never die and\nthey remain free form birth, death, and old age. He who offers Tulasi leaf to\nBhagavan Hari in the month of Kartik resides for three yugas in the temple of\nHari. Getting again a good birth, he acquires the devotion to S\xc2\x92ri Hari and\nbecomes the Foremost of those who restrain their senses. He who bathes in the\nGanges early before the rising of the Sun remains in enjoyment in the temple\nof Hari for sixty thousand yugas. Getting again a good birth, he gets\n\n\n\np. 921\n\n\n\nthe Vi _sn_ u Mantra, and, quitting his mortal coil, becomes united with the\nFeet of S\xc2\x92ri Hari.\n\n\n\n61-77. He has not to come back from Vaiku _nt_ ha to this earth. He remains in\nHari\xc2\x92s Service and gets the same form of Hari. He who bathes daily in the\nGanges, becomes purified like the Sun and gets the result of performing the\nHorse-sacrifice at every step. The earth becomes purified by the dust of his\nfeet and he enjoys in Vaiku _nt_ ha as long as the Sun and Moon exist. Then\nagain he becomes born in a good and beautiful womb, and is liberated by\nacquiring the devotion to Hari. He becomes very energetic and the foremost of\nthe ascetics, pure, religious, learned, and self-restrained. When the Sun\ncomes midway between Pisces and Cancer and heats intensely the earth, the man\nwho in Bharata gives cool water to drink to the people, resides in happiness\nin Kailas\xc2\x92a for fourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life periods. Getting again a good birth\nhere, he becomes beautiful, happy, devoted to S\xc2\x92iva, energetic and expert in\nthe Vedas, and the Vedangas. He who gives to a Brahma _n_ a the S\xc2\x92aktu\n(sattu). in the month of Vais\xc2\x92akhe enjoys in the S\xc2\x92iva temple for as many\nyears as there are number of particles in that quantity of sattu (powders in\nparched oat). He who performs the Kri _sn_ a Janma _st_ ami vow in this\nBharata, is freed from the sins incurred in his hundred births; there is no\ndoubt in this. The observer of the vow remains in great enjoyment in Vaiku\n_nt_ ha for fourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life periods, gets again a good birth here and\nacquires Hari Bhakti. He who performs the S\xc2\x92ivaratri vow in this Bharata Var\n_s_ a, resides with great joy in S\xc2\x92iva Loka for seven manvantaras. He who\noffers the Bel leaves to S\xc2\x92iva in S\xc2\x92ivaratri time, resides with great joy in\nS\xc2\x92iva\xc2\x92s Abode for as many yugas as there are number of leaves. Getting again a\ngood birth here, he acquires the devotion to S\xc2\x92iva and becomes learned,\nprosperous and possesses sons, subjects and lands. He who performs vow and\nworships S\xc2\x92ankara in the month of Chaitra or Magha and who, with a branch of a\ntree in hand, dances day and night for one month, or half a month, for ten\ndays or for seven days, dwells in S\xc2\x92iva Loka for as many yugas as the number\nof days he dances. He who performs the vow of S\xc2\x92ri Rama Navami, lives in the\nabode of Vi _sn_ u for seven Manvantaras in great joy. Getting again a good\nbirth, he becomes devoted to S\xc2\x92ri Rama, the foremost of those who have self\nrestraint and he becomes very wealthy.\n\n\n\n78-87. He who performs the Saradiya Puja (the great Durga Puja in the month of\nautumn) of the Mula Prakriti with incense, lights, offerings of food, and\nanimal sacrifices of buffaloes, goats, sheep, rhinoceros, frogs or other\nanimals, together with dancing, music, and various other aus-\n\n\n\np. 922\n\n\n\npicious things, resides in the S\xc2\x92iva Loka for seven Manvantaras. Getting an\nexcellent birth, and a pure understanding, he gets unbounded prosperity, sons\nand, no doubt, grandsons and he becomes a very powerful sovereign possessing\nmany horses and elephants. There is no doubt in this. Again he who worships\ndaily with devotion for a fortnight beginning from the eighth day of the\nbright fortnight the Maha Devi Lak _s_ mi, remains in the region of Goloka for\nfourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life periods. Then, obtaining an excellent birth, he becomes\na sovereign. He who in the full moon night in the month of Kartik prepares a\nRasa ma _nd_ al with one hundred Gopas and Gopis and worships S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a\nand Radha in S\xc2\x92alagrama or in images with sixteen varieties of offerings\nremains in Goloka for Brahma\xc2\x92s life-time and coming again to Bharata acquires\nan unflinching devotion to S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a.\n\n\n\n88-99. And when this Bhakti becomes greatly intensified, ho gets initiated\ninto S\xc2\x92ri Hari mantra and after quitting his mortal coil, he goes to the\nGoloka. Then he gets the Sarupya (the same form) of Kri _sn_ a and becomes the\nchief Pari _s_ ad (attendant of Kri _sn_ a) and, becoming free from old age,\nhe has no fear, to fall again down to this earth. He who observes the Ekadas\xc2\x92i\nday, remains fasting and performing penances in the bright or dark eleventh\nday, remains in Vaiku _nt_ ha in great enjoyment and comfort. Then, again\ncoming into this Bharata he becomes a devotee of Hari. And when that Bhakti is\nintensified he becomes solely devoted to Hari and quitting his mortal coil,\ngoes again to the Goloka and gets the Sarupya of Kri _sn_ a and becomes His\nPari _s_ ada (attendant). Then, freed of old age and death, he does not fall.\nHe who worships Indra in the month of Bhadra in the twelfth day of the white\nfortnight is worshipped in the regions of Indra for sixty thousand years. He\nwho performs in Bharata the worship of the Sun on Sunday Sankranti (when the\nSun goes from one sign to another) and the bright seventh Tithi, according to\ndue rules and ceremonies and eats the food called Havi _s_ yanna (rice boiled\nin ghee), dwells in the Suryaloka for fourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life periods. Then\ncoming to Bharata, he becomes free from all diseases and becomes prosperous.\nHe who worships Savitri on the fourteenth day of the black fortnight dwells in\nthe region of Brahma for seven Manvantaras with great eclat and glory. Coming\nagain to Bharata he enjoys beauty, unequalled valour, long life, knowledge and\nprosperity. He who worships on the fifth day of the bright fortnight in the\nmonth of Magha, with his senses controlled and full of devotion, the Devi\nSarasvati with sixteen articles of food, resides in Ma _n_ i Dvipa for one day\nand one night of Brahma.\n\n\n\n100-140. On getting re-birth, he becomes a poet and a learned man. He who\ndaily gives with devotion for his whole life, cow and gold to a Brahma _n_ a\ndwells in Vi _sn_ u Loka for twice as many years as there are\n\n\n\np. 923\n\n\n\nthe numbers of hairs on the bodies of these cows and plays and jests with Vi\n_sn_ u and doing auspicious things he finds pleasure. In the end he comes\nagain to this Bharata and becomes the King of Kings. He becomes fortunate,\nprosperous, possesses many sons, becomes learned, full of knowledge and happy\nin every way. He who feeds a Brahma _n_ a here with sweetmeats goes to Vi _sn_\nu Loka and enjoys there for as many years as there are hairs on the body of\nthe Brahmi _n_. In the end he comes again to Bharata and becomes happy,\nwealthy, learned, long lived, fortunate and very powerful. He who utters the\nname of Hari or gives the name (i.e., the mantra) of Hari to others, is\nworshipped in Vi _sn_ u loka for as many yugas as the number of times, the\nname or mantra was uttered. Coming again to Bharata, he becomes happy and\nwealthy. And if such things be done in Naraya _n_ a K _s_ ettra, ko _t_ i\ntimes the above results ensue. He who repeats the name of Hari ko _t_ i times\nin Naraya _n_ a K _s_ ettra, becomes, no doubt, freed of all sins and\nliberated while living and he will not get rebirth. He lives always in Vaiku\n_nt_ ha. He gets the Salokya (the same region of Vi _sn_ u), is not liable to\nfall, becomes a Bhakta of Vi _sn_ u. He who daily worships the earthen phallic\nsymbol (after making it daily) for his whole life, goes to the S\xc2\x92iva Loka and\ndwells there, for as many years as there are the number of particles of earth.\nGetting rebirth he becomes the King of Kings. He who worships daily the\nS\xc2\x92alagrama stone and eats the water (after bathing it) is glorified in Vaiku\n_nt_ ha for one hundred Brahma\xc2\x92s lives and becomes born again. When he\nacquires the rare Hari Bhakti and quiting his mortal coil goes to Vi _sn_ u\nLoka, whence he is not to return. He who performs all the Tapasyas\n(asceticims) and observes all the vratas (vows), dwells in Vaiku _nt_ ha for\nfourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life peroids. Getting rebirth in Bharata he becomes the King\nof Kings and then he becomes liberated. He is not to return any more. He who\nbathes in all the Tirthas and makes a journey round the whole world, gets\nNirva _n_ a. He is not reborn. He who performs the Horse-Sacrifice in this\nholy land Bharata enjoys half the Indraship for as many years as there are\nhairs on the body of the horse. He who performs a Rajasuya Sacrifice, gets\nfour times the above result. Of all the sacrifices, the Devi Yaj\xc3\xb1a, or the\nSacrifice before the Devi is the Best. O Fair One! Of old, Vi _sn_ u, Brahma,\nIndra and when Tripurasura was killed, Maha Deva did such a sacrifice. O\nBeautiful One! This sacrifice before the S\xc2\x92akti is the highest and best of all\nthe sacrifices. There is nothing like this in the three worlds. This Great\nSacrifice was done of yore by Dak _s_ a when he collected abundant sacrificial\nmaterials of all sorts. And a quarrel ensued on this account between Dak _s_ a\nand S\xc2\x92ankara. The Brahmi _n_ s\n\n\n\np. 924\n\n\n\nconducting the sacrifice cursed the Nandi and others. And Nandi cursed the\nBrahma _n_ as. Mahadeva, therefore, disallowed the going on of sacrifice and\nbrought it to a dead stop. Of yore the Prajapati Dak _s_ a did this Devi\nYaj\xc3\xb1a; it was done also by Dharma, Kas\xc2\x92yapa; Ananta, Kardama, Svayambhuva\nManu, his son Priyavrata, S\xc2\x92iva, Sanat Kumara, Kapila and Dhruva. The\nperformance of this sacrifice brings fruits equal to performing thousands and\nthousands of Rajasuya sacrifices. Therefore there is no other sacrifice\ngreater than this Devi Yaj\xc3\xb1a. One becomes surely endowed with a long life of\none hundred years and is liberated while living. He becomes equal to Vi _sn_ u\nin knowledge, energy, strength, and asceticism. This is as true as anything. O\nChild! This Devi Yaj\xc3\xb1a is the best and highest of all the sacrifices as Vi\n_sn_ u is the highest amongst the Devas; Narada, amongst the Vai _sn_ avas;\nthe Vedas, amongst all the S\xc2\x92astras; the Brahma _n_ as amongst all the castes;\nthe Ganges amongst the sacred places of pilgrimages, S\xc2\x92iva amongst the Holy of\nHolies, the Ekadas\xc2\x92i vow amongst all the Vratas; Tulasi, amongst all the\nflowers; the Moon, amongst the asterisms; Garu _d_ a, amongst the birds;\nPrakriti, Radha, Sarasvati and Earth amongst the females; the mind, amongst\nthe quick-going and restless senses; Brahma, amongst the Prajapatis; Brahma,\namongst all the subjects; Vrindraban, amongst all the forests; Bharat Var _s_\na, amongst all the Var _s_ as; Lak _s_ mi, amongst the prosperous; Sarasvati,\namongst the learned; Durga, amongst the chaste; Radhika, amongst the\nfortunate. If one hundred horse sacrifices are performed, Indrahood is sure to\nbe obtained. It is by the influence of bathing in all the Tirthas, performing\nall the sacrifices, observing all the Vratas, practising all the austerities,\nstudying all the Vedas and circumambulating the whole earth, that this Highest\nS\xc2\x92akti\xc2\x92s service is obtained and this service of S\xc2\x92akti is the direct cause of\nMukti (liberation). To worship the lotus-feet of the Devi is the best and\nhighest, is stated in all the Pura _n_ as, in all the Vedas, and in all the\nItihasas. To sing the glories of Mula Prakriti, to meditate on Her, to chant\nHer Name and attributes, to remember Her stotras, bow down before Her, to\nrepeat Her Name, and to drink daily Her Padodoka (water after washing Her\nfeet) and the offerings already offered to Her, these are approved of by all;\nand everyone desires this. So worship, worship this Mula Prakriti, Who is of\nthe nature of Brahma, and, lo! Who is again endowed with Maya. O Child! Take\nyour husband and live happily with him in your home. O Child! Thus I have\ndescribed to you the fruition of the Karmas. This is auspicious to every human\nbeing, desired by all and approved of by all. The Real Knowledge springs from\nthis. There is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\np. 925\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirtieth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the conversation between\nSavitri and Yama and on the fruition of Karmas in the Great Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri\nMad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 31](bk09ch31.htm)\n\n'
