The loving (women) have (amorously) excited [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:1:1)\ntheir lover, as wives of the same nest (house) their own husband. The sisters\nhave delighted in the dark and in the red (goddess)\n[2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:1:2), as the cows in the brightly shining dawn.\n\n2\\. Our fathers, the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:2:1), have broken even\nthe strong fortresses by their hymns, the rock by their shouting. They have\nopened to us the path of the great heaven; they have obtained day and sun and\nthe shine of the dawn [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:2:2).\n\n3\\. They founded the _Ri_ ta; they set into motion the thought of it\n[1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:3:1). Thus then the widely-spread (prayers)\n[2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:3:2) of the poor [3](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:3:3) which\nseek to obtain (wealth), which are free from thirst\n[4](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:3:4), the active, approach\n[5](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:3:5) the tribe of the gods\n[6](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:3:6), strengthening them by offering them delight.\n\n4\\. When Matari _s_ van had produced him by attrition, he, the reddish, the\nnoble one, who was brought to many places [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:4:1), has\ncome to every house. Then the Bh _ri_ gu-like [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:4:2)\nhas undertaken the messengership [3](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:4:3) (for the\nmortal) as for a mightier king, being attached to him.\n\n5\\. When he had created sap to the great father Heaven, the knowing one\nstealthily approached the speckled (cows). The archer fiercely shot an arrow\nat him. The god turned his impetuous power against his daughter\n[1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:5:1).\n\n6\\. Augment, O Agni, twofold the strength of\n\np. 75\n\nthe man who worships [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:6:1) thee in his house, or\noffers adoration to the loving one [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:6:2) day by day.\nMay he whom thou incitest be united with riches [3](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:6:3).\n\n7\\. Every nourishment goes towards Agni [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:7:1), as the\nseven young [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:7:2) rivers (flow) into the ocean. Our\nstrength does not shine from kinsmen [3](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:7:3). Do thou\ntherefore who knowest this, procure among the gods kindness for us.\n\n8 [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:8:1). When the sharp splendour\n[2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:8:2) reached the lord of men to incite him\n[3](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:8:3), the bright sperm poured down from Heaven (or,\nfrom the god Dyaus) [4](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:8:4), Agni produced\n[5](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:8:5) and furthered the blameless, young, well-wishing\nhost [6](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:8:6).\n\n9\\. He who traverses the paths quickly [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:9:1) like\nthought, the Sun alone rules over wealth altogether. (There are) the two kings\nMitra and Varu _n_ a with graceful hands [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:9:2), who\nwatch over the beloved ambrosia [3](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:9:3) in the cows.\n\n10\\. Do not forget, O Agni, who art a sage possessed of knowledge\n[1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:10:1), our paternal friendship. Old age impairs the\nappearance (of men) as a cloud (covers the sun or the sky). Before this curse\n(attains us), think thou (of us) [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:10:2).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh.\n\nThough the hymns 71-73 are not composed in the Vira _g_ metre like the\npreceding hymns, it is shown by \'manifold evidence that they had the same\norigin. Verse 8 = VS. XXXIII, 11; TS. I, 3, 14, 6; MS. IV, 14, 15.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Comp. Geldner, Vedische Studien, II, 134.\n\nNote 2. if the text is correct, the \'sisters\' may either\n\np. 76\n\nbe the ten fingers which generate Agni by attrition (III, 29, 13; IV, 6, 8),\nor the streams of water among which Agni grows up, or streams of Gh _ri_ ta or\nthe like (comp. II, 5, 5 see below). Why these sisters are said to delight in\nthe dark and in the bright goddess, the Night and the Dawn, remains doubtful.\n\nBut I think there are reasons which strongly recommend a correction of the\ntext. In III, 55, II we read _s_ ya\xc2\xb4vi _k_ a \xe2\x80\xa6 arushi _k_ a svasarau, \'the two\nsisters, the dark one and the red one.\' Is it not probable that in our passage\nalso it is the sisters who are described as dark and red? The dark goddess and\nthe red goddess of course are Night and Dawn, and Night and Dawn, as is well\nknown, are sisters in Vedic poetry. And furthermore the \'sisters\' are\ndescribed in our verse as amorously exciting the god Agni: for it cannot well\nbe doubted that the svasara _h_ of the third Pada are identical with the u _s_\nati\xc2\xb4 _h_ of the first: similarly it is said in 70, 7--in a hymn belonging to\nthe same collection with out Sukta--that the Nights and Dawns augment Agni\'s\ngreatness; in other passages Agni is represented as beloved by the Dawn, or as\nsuckled by Night and Dawn (Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, II, 14. 15). The\n\'sisters\' then are stated in our verse to delight (a _g_ ushran), probably in\nAgni: now we read in II, 2, 2. abhi tva nakti _h_ ushasa _h_ vava _s_ ire agne\nvatsam na svasareshu dhenava _h_ , \'The Nights and Dawns, Agni, have lowed at\nthee as the milch-cows in their stalls at their calves;\' comp. Bergaigne, II,\n15. Thus everything is clear, if we take the u _s_ ati\xc2\xb4 _h_ and the svasara\n_h_ for the bright and dark goddesses, i. e. for the Dawns and Nights. The\ncorrection of the text to which this interpretation leads, is svasara _h_ _s_\nya\xc2\xb4vi _h_ arushi _h_ a _g_ ushran, \'the dark and the red sisters have\ndelighted (in Agni).\' It is easy to understand that the corruption of the text\nwas occasioned by the simile of the fourth Pada. The words ushasam na _g_ a\xc2\xb4va\n_h_ seemed to demand a parallel nominative and a parallel accusative in the\nthird Pada. The nominative was svasara _h_ , but there was no accusative. Thus\nprobably arose the reading _s_ ya\xc2\xb4vim arushim.\n\np. 77\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. On the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras as the fathers of the priestly tribes, see H. O.,\nReligion des Veda, 278.\n\nNote 2. The phrase ushasa _h_ ketu _h_ occurs several times in the Rig-veda. I\nthink that ketum usra\xc2\xb4 _h_ means exactly the same; it has been shown by Kaegi,\nFestgruss an Boehtlingk, p. 49, and by Bartholomae, Bezzenberger\'s Beitrage,\nXV, 185, that a genitive sing. usra\xc2\xb4 _h_ existed.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Ludwig refers asya to the sacrificer, Bollensen to Agni, and so does\nSaya _n_ a. I believe that asya should be explained as _ri_ tasya; the phrase\n_ri_ tasya dhiti is frequently used, comp. IV, 23, 8; IX, 76, 4; 97, 34; 111,\n2. See also Ludwig\'s note on III, 31, 1 (vol. v, p. 65).--Prof. Max Muller\nrefers _ri_ ta to Agni. \'One might translate it by righteous: They established\nthe righteous (Agni), they moved his mind (made him attend?).\'\n\nNote 2. The substantive (of feminine gender) which is to be supplied to\ndidhishv\xcc\x83a _h_ , at _ri_ shyanti _h_ , &c., seems to me to be gira _h_ or the\nlike. Arya _h_ stands frequently together with gira _h_.--Prof. Max Muller\nwrites: \'Could not ari be a feminine like _k_ arsha _n_ i and vi _s_ ; see\nbefore, I, 70, I. We should then translate, and then the people emulous,\nwidely spread, never flagging [the stones also are called at _ri_ shita _h_ at\n_ri_ sh _n_ a _g_ a _h_ , X, 94, 11], and active go towards the gods.\'\n\nNote 3. See above, 70, 1, note 1.\n\nNote 4. Are the prayers called \'free from thirst\' because they are accompanied\nby libations of Gh _ri_ ta, Soma, &c.?\n\nNote 5. I believe that deva\xc2\xb4n _g_ anma depends both on a _k_ _kh_ a and on\nvardhayanti _h_.\n\nNote 6. Deva\xc2\xb4n, or rather deva\xc2\xb4m, is gen. plur.; see above, 70, 6, with note\n1.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The place in which vibh _ri_ ta _h_ stands would seen to show that it\nis an epithet of Matari _s_ van, and so it is understood by Ludwig and by\nBergaigne (Rel. Ved. I, 54).\n\np. 78\n\n[paragraph continues] But it is Agni himself, not Matari _s_ van, who is very\nfrequently mentioned as vibh _ri_ ta or the like. As we read here, vibh _ri_\nta _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 g _ri_ he-g _ri_ he, it is said in V, II, 4. agnim nara _h_ vi\nbharante g _ri_ he-g _ri_ he, \'the men carry Agni hither and thither, to every\nhouse;\' comp. I, 70, 10; III, 55, 4; X, 1, 2; 45, 2; 80, 4. Thus I believe the\npoet means to say that Matari _s_ van first kindled Agni, in one place of\ncourse, and that Agni then was brought to many places, to all human dwellings.\nI think that the text indeed can be understood in this way, if we suppose that\nthe author, for the sake of the metre, allowed himself a hyperbaton or\nsynchysis.\n\nWe must not omit to mention that the first Pada of I, 148, 1 is nearly\nidentical with our passage: mathit yat im vish _t_ a _h_ matari _s_ va. This\nPada is deficient by one syllable. If we were to read vibh _ri_ ta _h_ , as in\nour passage, this would lead indeed to the conclusion that there is no\nhyperbaton in our verse--for the verse, I, 148, 1, could not be explained in\nthat way--but that vibh _ri_ ta _h_ refers to Matari _s_ van. I think,\nhowever, that it is more than doubtful that the verse, I, 148, 1, really ought\nto be corrected in this way; whatever may have been the original form of that\nverse, it is quite possible, and even probable, that it differed from our\npassage just in that one word.\n\nNote 2. The exact meaning of Bh _r i_gava _n_ a is doubtful. It is, of course,\nderived from Bh _r i_gu as vasavana, takavana, from vasu, taku. Agni is called\nBh _r i_gava _n_ a also in IV, 7, 4. Comp. Bergaigne, I, 54.\n\nNote 3. With the words a\xc2\xb4 duty\xcc\x83am vivaya comp. IV, 9, 6. veshi it u asya\nduty\xcc\x83am.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. This difficult verse evidently treats of the incest which the father\nDyaus has committed with his daughter. Compare on this subject Bergaigne, Rel.\nVed. II, 109 seq. Agni seems to be represented here as stimulating the desire\nof the father; the \'sap\' (rasa) probably is the sperm, comp. I, 105, 2.\n\np. 79\n\nIn the second Pada, Agni, having done, as it seems, some mischief, goes away\nto the speckled cows.\' We cannot say who these speckled cows were; they\nevidently are identical with those mentioned in another passage treating of\nthe same story, X, 61, S.--Bergaigne paraphrases the second Pada of our verse,\nwrongly in my opinion, \'Agni sort furtivement de cette fille, de cette vache,\np _ri_ _s_ ani\xc2\xb4.\'\n\nThe archer who shoots at Agni (third Pada) is not better known to us than the\nspeckled cows. Bergaigne\'s opinion, \'que cet archer n\'est autre que le pere\nlui-meme,\' is not very convincing.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The traditional reading vibha\xc2\xb4ti (\'he who shines for thee in his\nhouse\') gives no satisfactory sense. I propose to read vidha\xc2\xb4ti. Cf. I, 120,\n1. katha\xc2\xb4 vidhati apra _k_ eta _h_.\n\nNote 2. I have some doubts as to the correctness of u _s_ ata _h_ (Sa _m_\nhitapa _th_ a, u _s_ ato) anu dyu\xc2\xb4n. U _s_ at, of course, is an epithet not of\nthe days, but of Agni. But then we expect the dative. Correcting the text (u\n_s_ ate) is all the easier, because before a following vowel the dative and\nthe genitive were, in the original pronunciation, identical (u _s_ ata\xe0\xa4\xbdanu;\nsee my Prolegomena, 447 sqq.); the spellings of the Sa _m_ hitapa _th_ a, u\n_s_ ato anu and u _s_ ate anu, belong to the inventions of Vedic grammarians.\n\nNote 3. Literally, May he whom thou incitest drive on the same chariot with\nriches. Comp. such expressions as rathi\xc2\xb4 _h_ raya _h_ and the like.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Comp. IV, 44, 2. yuvo _h_ vapu _h_ abhi p _r i_ksha _h_ sa _k_ ante;\nVII, 90, 5.\n\nNote 2. Comp. I, 26, 10, note 1.\n\nNote 3. Ludwig: nicht unter unsern freunden ward auszfundig gemacht die\nkraftspeise. Grassmann: nicht bei Verwandten ward uns Nahrung sichtbar.\nWilson: Our food is not partaken of by our kinsmen. Griffith: Not by our\nbrethren was our food discovered.--Ludwig and Grassmann translate as if the\ntext had _g_ amishu. What the\n\np. 80\n\ninstrumental means is shown, I believe, for instance, by IV, 14, 2. vi su\xc2\xb4rya\n_h_ ra _s_ mibhi _h_ _k_ ekitana _h_ , \'the sun shining with his rays.\' Thus\nin our passage the poet seems to me to say, \'We have no strong kinsmen who\nmight add lustre to our strength. Agni, procure thou strength to us.\' Comp. X,\n23, 7. vidma hi te pramatim deva _g_ amivat, \'for we know, O god, thy\nproviding care like that of a kinsman.\'--Prof. Max Muller proposes the\ntranslation: \'Our wealth is not known by our kinsmen, i. e. we cannot support\nthem as we ought.\'\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The poet returns here to the myth of which he had spoken in verse 5.\nShould the order of the verses be changed?--On our verse, compare Geldner,\nVed. Studien, II, 34.\n\nNote 2. Te _g_ as seems to be here a synonym of retas, as in the later\nlanguage.\n\nNote 3. Is the lord of men Agni? See the third Pada.--Ishe I consider, with\nGeldner, as an infinitive.\n\nNote 4. My translation rests on the supposition that dyau _h_ is to he\ncorrected into dyo _h_ ; thus the ablative is obtained, of which the word\nabhi\xc2\xb4ke is usually accompanied (comp. Lanman, 433; Collitz, Bezzenberger\'s\nBeitrage, X, 15). If we leave the reading dyau _h_ , this nominative will be\nthe subject of the verb a\xc2\xb4na _t_. Then te _g_ a _h_ must be accusative\ndependent on a\xc2\xb4na _t_ , and we can scarcely avoid making n _ri_ patim to\ndepend on the infinitive ishe. This is the way which Geldner has followed in\ninterpreting this passage. But I cannot consider this separation of n _ri_\npatim from the verb a\xc2\xb4na _t_ very probable.\n\nNote 5. The exact meaning of _g_ anayat seems to be here, \'he caused them to\nbe born.\' Comp. _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a I, 7, 4, 4. yatha tad deva reta _h_\npra _g_ anayan (comp. Aitareya Brahma _n_ a III, 34; see also Rig-veda X, 61,\n7).\n\nNote 6. This may be the host of the seven _Ri_ shis. Comp. III, 31, 1-5; IV,\n1, 12 seq. (?). Or the Maruts are alluded to (comp. below, 72, 4), though that\nseems to me less probable.\n\np. 81\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Literally, in one day. But sadya _h_ has already in the Rig-veda the\nsecondary meaning \'immediately, quickly.\'\n\nNote 2. Comp. III, 56, 7. ra\xc2\xb4 _g_ ana mitra\xc2\xb4-varu _n_ a supa _n_ i\xc2\xb4.\n\nNote 3. See below, 72, 6.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VII, 18, 2: there the words abhi vidu _h_ kavi _h_ san are\nidentical with our text.\n\nNote 2. Of the second hemistich Prof. Collitz has treated in Bezzenberger\'s\nBeitrage, X, 15, note. He paraphrases the meaning in the following way: \'Der\nSinn des ganzen Verses ist: unsere Freundschaft mit dir, Agni, stammt aus\nalter Zeit. Nun sagt man zwar "im Alter andert sich das Aussehn wie das der\nWolke." Aber stehe du uns bei vor diesem Fluche.\' I do not believe that this\ninterpretation, though very ingenious, gives the real meaning of the Vedic\npoet.--Comp. I, 179, I. mina\xc2\xb4ti _s_ riyam _g_ arima\xc2\xb4 tanu\xc2\xb4nam.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 72](sbe46022.htm)\n\n'
