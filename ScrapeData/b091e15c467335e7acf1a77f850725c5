Naraya _n_ a said:-- \xc2\x93O Devar _s_ i! The egg (born of Mula Prakriti)\nthat was floating in the waters for a period equal to the life period of\nBrahma, now in the fullness of time separated into two parts. Within that egg\nthere was a powerful Child, lustrous like one thousand millions of suns. This\nchild could not suck mother\xc2\x92s milk, as it was forsaken by Her. So being tired\nof hunger, the child for a moment cried repeatedly. The child that will become\nthe Lord of countless Brahma _nd_ as (universes), now an orphan having no\nfather nor mother began to look upwards from the waters. This boy came to be\ndenominated afterwards by the name of Maha Vira _t_ , when he became gross and\n\n\n\np. 816\n\n\n\ngrosser. As there is nothing finer than radium so there is nothing grosser\nthan Maha Vira _t_. The power of this Maha Vira _t_ is one-sixteenth of that\nof S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Highest Self. But this boy, (born of the Prakriti\nRadha) is the Sole Stay of all this Universe and he is denominated by the name\n\xc2\x93Maha-Vi _sn_ u\xc2\x94. In his every pore countless universes are existing. So much\nso that even S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a could not count them. If it were possible to\ncount the number of dust particles, it is impossible to count the number of\nuniverses. So there are endless Brahmas, Vi _sn_ us, and Mahes\xc2\x92varas. In every\nBrahma _nd_ a, there is Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, and Mahes\xc2\x92a. Each Brahma _nd_ a\nextends from Patala to the Brahmaloka. The abode of Vaiku _nt_ ha is higher\nthan that (i. e. it is situated outside of Brahma _nd_ a), again the abode of\nGoloka is fifty ko _t_ i yojanas (50 x 10 x 4 x 2 million miles) higher than\nVaiku _nt_ ha. This Goloka Dhama is eternal and real as S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a is\neternal and real. This world composed of the seven islands is surrounded by\nthe seven oceans. Forty-nine Upa Dvipas (smaller islands adjacent to them) are\nexisting here. Besides there are countless mountains and forests. Higher than\nthis earth is the Brahmaloka with seven heavens and below this are the seven\nPatalas. This is the bounding limit of Brahma _nd_ a. Just above this earth\nthere is the Bhurloka; above is Bhuvarloka; then Svarloka, then Janarloka,\nthen Taparloka, then Satyaloka, and above that is Brahmaloka. The splendour of\nBrahmaloka is like that of molten gold. But all the substances whether outside\nor inside this Brahmaloka, are transient. When this Brahma _nd_ a (cosmos)\ndissolves, everything dissolves and is destroyed. All are temporary like\nbubbles of water. Only Goloka and Vaiku _nt_ ha are eternal. In every pore of\nthis Maha Vira _t_ is existing one Brahma _nd_ a (cosmos). What to speak of\nothers when even Kri _sn_ a cannot count the number of these Brahma _nd_ as.\nIn every Brahma _nd_ a there is Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes\xc2\x92a. O Child Narada!\nIn every Brahma _nd_ a, the number of the gods is three ko _t_ is or 30\nmillions. Some of them are the Dikpatis (the Regents of the quarters); some\nare the Dikpalas (the Rulers of the quarters), some are asterisms, and some\nplanets. In the Bhurloka, there are four Var _n_ as (Brahmi _n_ s, etc.,) and\nin the Patalas there are Nagas. Thus the Universe exists composed of moveable\nand non-moveable things (This is Brahma _nd_ a Vivriti). O Narada! Now the\nVira _t_ Puru _s_ a began to look up to the skies again and again but He could\nnot see anything within that egg except the void. Then distressed with hunger\nHe cried out repeatedly and became merged in anxiety. Next moment getting back\nHis consciousness, He began to think of Kri _sn_ a, the Highest Person and saw\nthere at once the eternal light of Brahma. He saw there His form as deep blue\nlike new rain-cloud;\n\n\n\np. 817\n\n\n\nwith two hands, garment of a yellow colour, sweet smile on His face, flute in\nHis hand and He seemed to be very anxious to show His Grace to Devotees.\nLooking at the Lord, His Father, the boy became glad and smiled. The Lord, the\nBestower of boon granted him boons appropriate for that moment \xc2\x93O Child! Let\nyou possess knowledge like Me; let your hunger and thirst vanish; let you be\nthe holder of innumerable Brahma _nd_ as till the time of Pralaya (the\nuniversal dissolution). Be without any selfishness, be fearless and the\nbestower of boons to all. Let not old age, death, disease, sorrow nor any\nother ailings afflict thee. Thus saying He repeated thrice on his ear the six-\nlettered great Mantra \xc2\x93Om Kri _sn_ aya Svaha\xc2\x94 worshipped by the Vedas with\ntheir A _m_ gas, the Giver of desires and the destroyer of all troubles and\ncalamities. O Brahma\xc2\x92s Son! Thus giving the mantra, S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a arranged\nfor his feeding thus:-- In every universe, whatever offerings will be given to\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, one sixteenth of that will go to Narayana, the Lord of Vaiku\n_nt_ ha and fifteen-sixteenth is to go to this boy, the Vira _t_. S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a did not allot any share for Himself. Himself transcending all the Gun\n_a_ s, and Full, He is always satisfied with Himself. What necessity is there\nfor any further offerings? Whatever the people offer with devotion, the Lord\nof Laksmi, the Vira _t_ eats all these. Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a giving thus\nto the Vira _t_ the boon and the Mantra said:-- \xc2\x93O Child! Say what more you\ndesire; I will give you that instantly. The Vira _t_ boy, hearing thus the\nwords of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, spoke:-- \xc2\x93O Thou Omnipresent! I have got no desires\nwhatsoever, save this that as long as I live, whether for a short time or for\na long time, let me have pure Bhakti towards Thy lotus feet.\n\n\n\n35-41. In this world he is Jivanmukta (liberated whilst living) who is your\nBhakta; and that bewildered fool is dead while living who is devoid of any\nBhakti to Thee. What needs he to perform Japam, asceticism, sacrifice,\nworship, holding fasts and observances, going to sacred places of pilgrimages\nand other virtuous acts if he be without any bhakti to S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a? Vain\nis his life who is devoid of any devotion to S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, under Whose\nGrace he has obtained his life and Whom he does not now pay homage and\nworship. He is endowed with Sakti as long as \xc3\x82tma (Self) resides in his body;\nno sooner the \xc3\x82tma departs from his body all the Saktis accompany him. O Great\nOne! And thou art the Universal \xc3\x82tman (soul) who transcends Prakriti, Who is\nAll will, the Primeval Person and of the nature of the Highest Light. O Child!\nThus saying, the Vira _t_ boy remained silent. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a then, spoke in\nsweet words:-- \xc2\x93O Child! Let you remain as fresh as ever like Me. You will not\nhave any fall even if innumerable Brahmas pass away.\n\n\n\n42-57. Let you divide yourself in parts and turn into smaller Vira _t_ s in\nevery universe. Brahma will spring from your navel and will create\n\n\n\np. 818\n\n\n\nthe cosmos. From the forehead of that Brahma will spring eleven Rudras for the\ndestruction of the creation. But they will all be parts of S\xc2\x92iva. The Rudra\nnamed Kalagni, of these eleven Rudras, will be the destroyer of all this\nVis\xc2\x92vas (cosmos). Besides, from each of your sub-divisions, the Vis\xc2\x92nu will\noriginate and that Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u will be the Preserver of this Vis\xc2\x92vu\nworld. I say that under my favour you will always be full of Bhakti towards Me\nand no sooner you meditate on Me, you will be able to see My lovely form.\nThere is no doubt in this; and your Mother, Who resides in My breast, will not\nbe difficult for you to see. Let you remain here in ease and comfort. I now go\nto Goloka. Saying thus S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Lord of the world disappeared.\nGoing to His own abode He spoke instantly to Brahma and S\xc2\x92ankara, skilled in\nthe works of creation and destruction:-- \xc2\x93O Child Brahma! Go quickly and be\nborn in parts from the navels of each of the smaller Vira _t_ s that will\narise from the pores of the Great Vira _t_. O Child Mahadeva! Go and be born\nin parts from the forehead of each Brahma in every universe for the\ndestruction of the creation; (but be careful that you not forget) and perform\nausterities for a long, long time. O son of the Creator Brahma! Thus saying,\nthe Lord of the Universe remained silent. Brahma and S\xc2\x92iva, the auspicious,\nbowing to the Lord, went to their own duties. On the other hand, the great\nVira _t_ that lay floating in the waters of the Brahma _nd_ a sphere, created\nfrom his every pore each smaller Vira _t_. That youth Janardan of the form of\nthe Great Cosmos, wearing yellow garment of the bluish-green colour of the\nDurba grass, lay sleeping pervading everywhere. Brahma took his birth in His\nnavel. He, then, after his birth, began to travel in that navel-lotus and in\nthe stem of the lotus for one lakh yugas. But he could not find out the place\nwhence the lotus or its stem had sprung up. O Narada! Then your father became\nvery anxious and came back to his former place and began to meditate on the\nlotus feet of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. Then, in meditation, with his introspective\neye, he first saw the small Vira _t_ , then the endless great Vira _t_ lying\non the watery bed, in whose pores the universes are existing and then he saw\nthe God S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a in Goloka with Gopas and Gopis. He then began to\npraise the Lord of Goloka when He granted boons to your father, and he began\nto do the work of creation.\n\n\n\n58-62. From the mind of your father, were born first S\xc2\x92anaka and other\nbrothers and then from his forehead eleven Rudras sprang. Then from the left\nside of that small Vira _t_ lying on the bed of waters, the four-handed Vi\n_sn_ u Bhagavan, the Preserver of the Universe, came. He went to S\xc2\x92vetadvipa,\nwhere he remained. Then your father became engaged in creating this Universe,\nmoveable and non-moveable, composed\n\n\n\np. 819\n\n\n\nof three worlds, heaven, earth and Patala, in the navel of that small Vira _t_\nPurusa. O Narada! Thus from the pores of that great Vira _t_ each universe has\nsprung and in every universe there is one small Vira _t_ , one Brahma, one Vi\n_sn_ u and one S\xc2\x92iva and S\xc2\x92anaka and others. O Best of twice born! Thus I have\ndescribed the glories of Kri _sn_ a, that give exceeding pleasure and Mok _s_\na. Now say what more you want to hear?\n\n\n\nHere ends the Third Chapter of the Ninth Book on the Origin of Brahma, Vi _sn_\nu and Mahes\xc2\x92a and others in the Maha Puranam S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Maharsi Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 4](bk09ch04.htm)\n\n'
