They were times of real festivity and rejoicing, during\nwhich the Holy Name of God was chanted to the accompaniment of _Mridangas_ and\nother musical instruments. All the while the Bhagavan could be seen at His\nbest, singing, dancing with the joy of the Lord, and frequently lost in that\nblessed state of ecstasy or Samadhi. When the singing of devotional\n\np. 226\n\nhymns and the spiritual excitement which came with it were over, the company\npresent would be treated by the Bhagavan to one of those celestial\nconversations, so laden with sermons for the spiritual welfare of humanity,\nwhich will never die in the memory of those who had the rare privilege of\nlistening to Him.\n\nRamakrishna\'s ecstasy.The first part of the day was given to Sankirtan\n(singing forth the Name of the Lord). They were singing the songs telling of\nthe separation of the Gopis from the Lord Sri Krishna, who had gone to\nMathura. In the course of the songs, the Bhagavan was frequently in a state of\nSamadhi. They were singing. Suddenly He rose to His feet, saying: "O my\nfriend, do thou bring my beloved Krishna to me or take me over to the place\nwhere He is." The Bhagavan, it would appear, had merged His personality in\nthat of Radha, * the chief of the Gopis. He realized that He and Radha were\none. With those words He stood speechless and motionless, with fixed half-\nclosed eyes that moved not, evidently having lost all sense-consciousness.\nComing to Himself, He again, in a voice that\n\np. 227\n\ndrew tears from the eyes of those who heard Him, cried out: "O my friend, do\nme this favor and I shall be thy most devoted servant. Remember it was thou\nthat taughtest me my love for the Beloved."\n\nThe chorus went on singing. Radha was made in the song to say: "O! I will not\ngo to the bank of the Jamuna to draw water, for coming up to the Kadamba tree\nI am put in mind of my own, my Beloved." Ramakrishna, heaving a sigh, said,\n"Ah, me!" As the chorus chanted aloud the name of the Lord, the Bhagavan was\nagain on His feet and in Samadhi. Recovering His sense-consciousness, He could\nonly repeat inarticulately: "Kitma, Kitma," for "Krishna, Krishna."\n\nThe Sankirtan was brought to a close by the Bhagavan Himself leading the\nchorus in the well-known piece: "Victory to Radha, Victory to Govinda," and\ndancing with His disciples, who formed a ring around Him.\n\nThe madness of love for the Lord. The dancing and singing had all taken place\nin the reception-hall. The Bhagavan then withdrew into one of the adjoining\nrooms to the west. To a disciple He said, talking of the Gopis: How wonderful\nwas their devotion! At the sight of the\n\np. 228\n\n[paragraph continues] Tamal tree they were seized with the very madness of\nlove.\n\nDisciple: This was also the case with Chaitanya. Looking at the forest he\nthought it was Vrindavan, the sacred birthplace of Sri Krishna, that was\nbefore him!\n\nBhagavan: Oh! if anyone is but favored with a single particle of this ecstatic\nlove! What devotion! What intense love! Of this devotion they not only had the\nfull complement (sixteen Annas) but a great deal more than the full complement\n--five Sikas and five Annas! This is called the madness of Divine Love. The\nchief thing is to have intense love and sincere and earnest longing for God.\nOn whatever path you may travel, whether you believe in the Divinity with or\nwithout form, whether you have faith in God-incarnate in a human form or not,\n--if you have intense love and sincere longing for Him, you are sure to attain\nto Him. He alone knows what He is like. He Himself will make you realize His\nDivine Nature. Why should you be mad after the things of the world? If you\nmust be mad, be mad for God. There is a madness of Divine Love, a madness of\nBhakti, or ecstasy, and a madness of Jnana. Radha had the madness of\n\np. 229\n\n[paragraph continues] Divine Love. Hanuman showed the madness of true\ndevotion. When Sita was forced by Rama to prove her chastity by going through\nthe ordeal of fire, Hanuman, although a devotee of Rama, was so maddened that\nhe wished to kill his Lord, the Divine Incarnation. I saw a true Jnani, who\nwandered like a madman. He came to the Temple garden. He had so realized the\noneness of the Spirit in every living creature that when he saw a dog eating\nthe remains of a dish, he held him by the ears and said: "Brother, wilt thou\neat all?" He then took a portion and ate with the dog. He said to Hridrai:\n"When the holy waters of the Ganges and the water of the gutter appear the\nsame, then will come the realization of Divine oneness."\n\nAt one time I had this madness. I used to walk like a madman, seeing the same\nSpirit everywhere and recognizing neither high nor low in caste or creed. I\ncould eat even with a Pariah. I had the constant realization that Brahman is\nTruth and the world is unreal like a dream. Once Mathura Babu took me in a\nboat. The Mohammedan crew were cooking and I was about to eat with them, but\nMathura Babu would not let me. In that state I used to\n\np. 230\n\nbow down before everybody and would ask them to repeat the Holy Name of the\nLord. As in a violent storm a screen of dust rises, hiding the trees of\ndifferent kinds and making all trees appear alike, so in that storm of\nspiritual vision I could not distinguish one man from another as high or low.\n\nA devotee: Bhagavan, how can a man live in the world and experience any of\nthese kinds of madness?\n\nSri Ramakrishna: These states are not for those who are living in the world\nand performing the duties of the world, but for those who have absolutely\nrenounced internally and externally. External renunciation is not for those\nwho live in the world. They should practise internal renunciation or mental\nnon-attachment.\n\n(To a disciple) A man brought a bottle of wine; I went to touch it but could\nnot.\n\nDisciple: Why, Bhagavan?\n\nDivine intoxication.Ramakrishna: When Divine bliss is attained, one becomes\nintoxicated with it, he does not need to drink wine. When I see the feet of my\nDivine Mother, I feel as intoxicated as if I had drunk five bottles of wine.\nIn this state one cannot eat anything and everything.\n\np. 231\n\nDisciple: As regards eating, one should eat what one gets.\n\nFood for a Bhakta.Ramakrishna: That depends upon the spiritual state. In the\npath of Jnana that produces no harm; when a Jnani eats, he pours the food as\nan offering in the fire of Kundalini. But for a Bhakta it is different. A\nBhakta should eat only pure food, such food as he can freely offer to his\nBeloved Lord. Animal food is not for a Bhakta. But at the same time, I must\nsay, if a man loves God after eating the flesh of a pig, he is blessed, and\nwretched is the man who lives on milk and rice, but whose mind is absorbed in\nlust and gold. Once I took as _mantram_ the name of Allah from a Mohammedan\nteacher and repeated the name for several days and ate their food.\n\nii\n\nThe Bhagavan then came back into the hall followed by His disciples and seated\nHimself. A pillow was placed for Him to recline upon. Before touching it, He\nsaid, " _Om tat sat_ " (Brahman is the only Reality). The pillow was, of\ncourse, one which had been used by the unholy men of the world, and the\nBhagavan was purity itself. It was getting late, but no dinner was\n\np. 232\n\nbeing served and the Bhagavan became a little impatient like a child.\nSurendra, the host, was a beloved disciple of the Lord. The Bhagavan said:\nSurendra\'s disposition has grown admirable. He is very generous; those who go\nto him for help never come away disappointed. Then he is very outspoken. He is\nbold enough to speak the truth.\n\nTruthfulness.In this age truthfulness is the best of all ascetic practices. He\nwho is firm in truthfulness attains to God. Lack of truthfulness destroys all\nvirtue. For this reason, when I say anything even inadvertently, such as, "I\nshall go there. I shall do that," I must go, because I have said it. I may\nlose my firmness in truthfulness if I do not keep my word to the very letter.\nOpenness as opposed to dissimulation is the fruit of the practice of many\nreligious austerities in one\'s previous incarnations. In a well-known song by\nTulsi Das * it is said: "Give up dissimulation and\n\np. 233\n\ncunning." Do you not see that whenever God has taken a human form, this great\nvirtue of guilelessness has never failed to come to view? Look at Dasaratha,\nthe father of Rama, and Nanda Ghosh, the father of Sri Krishna. They were both\nfree from guile. (To a young disciple) Like men of the world, you have\naccepted a position, but you are working for your mother. Otherwise I should\nhave said: "For shame! For shame! You must serve only the Lord." (To Mani\nMullik) This young man is open and guileless to a degree; only nowadays he\noccasionally tells untruths, that is all. The other day he said that he would\ncome to see me, but he did not. (To Mahendra) You went to see Bhagavan Das;\nhow did you like him?\n\nMahendra: Yes, Revered Sir, I went to see him. The great Vaishnava sage has\nbecome very old. He was lying down when I saw him; a disciple put some food\ninto his mouth. He can hear only when addressed in loud tones. After hearing\nThy name, he said to me: "You need not fear anything. Ramakrishna is a\n\np. 234\n\n[paragraph continues] Divine Manifestation. To worship His name is to worship\nGod."\n\nHere Mahima came in and the Bhagavan exclaimed: This is a visit quite\nunexpected! We expect at most a shallop in this poor river of ours, yet here\ncomes a ship! But then it is the rainy season!\n\nThe conversation next turned on the spiritual aspect of feasts and the\nBhagavan said to Mahima: Why is it that people are fed at a feast? Do you not\nthink that it is the same as offering a sacrifice to God who is the Living\nFire in all creatures? But bad men, not God-fearing, guilty of adultery and\nfornication, should on no account be entertained at a feast. Their sins are so\ngreat that several cubits of earth beneath the place where they eat become\npolluted.\n\niii\n\nProtap Chunder Mozoomdar, * a member of the Brahmo-Samaj, entered and saluted\nSri\n\np. 235\n\n[paragraph continues] Ramakrishna. The Bhagavan, as usual, returned his\nsalutation with His well-known modesty, bowing very low. Mozoomdar said:\nRevered Sir, I have recently been to Darjeeling.\n\nSri Ramakrishna: But you do not appear to be much the better for the change.\nWhat is the matter with you?\n\nMozoomdar: The same complaint to which Keshab Chunder Sen succumbed.\n\nEgotism rises from ignorance.A certain Mahratta lady was then spoken of.\nMozoomdar said that she had been to England and had embraced Christianity. He\nasked the Bhagavan whether He had ever heard of the woman. The Bhagavan\nreplied: No, but from what I hear from you, I should think she must be a\nperson who wishes to make a name for herself. Egotism of this kind is not\ngood. Those who seek for fame are under a delusion. "I do this or that," this\nsense arises from ignorance. But "O Lord, Thou art doing everything" is true\n\np. 236\n\nknowledge. God is the real Actor, others are actors in name only.\n\nThe ego of a calf.The calf says, "Hamma" or "Aham" (I). Now look at the\ntroubles caused by the self which says "I, I." In the first place, the calf is\nsometimes taken into the field where it is yoked to the plough. It is there\nmade to work on from morning till evening, alike in the sun and in the rain.\nIts troubles are not yet over. It is very often killed by the butcher. Its\nflesh is eaten as meat. Its skin is tanned into hides which are then made into\nshoes. The sufferings of the calf in this state know no bounds. But that is\nnot all. Drums are made with the skin which is thus mercilessly beaten,\nsometimes with the hand and sometimes with the drumstick. It is only when out\nof its entrails are made strings for the bows used for carding cotton that the\ntroubles of the poor creature are over. And that is because it no longer says,\n"Hamma, Hamma" (I, I), but "Tuhum, Tuhum" (It is Thou, O Lord! It is Thou!).\nSimilarly, when Jiva (ego) says, "O Lord! Not I but Thou art the doer and\nactor, I am merely an instrument in Thy hand," it becomes free from all the\nworld\'s troubles and attains to absolute freedom from birth and\n\np. 237\n\nrebirth in this world of sorrow and suffering.\n\nA devotee: How can Jiva become free from egoism (Ahamkara)?\n\nBhagavan: Egoism does not leave until one has realized God. If anyone has\nbecome absolutely free from egoism (Ahamkara) you must know that that person\nhas seen and realized Divinity.\n\nDevotee: Revered Sir, what are the signs of one who has seen and realized God?\n\nSigns of one who has realized God.Bhagavan: The signs of one who has seen God\nare thus described in Bhagavatam. There are four kinds. First, His conduct is\nlike that of a child. A truly wise man who has seen the Lord becomes like a\nchild. A child has no real egoism. He is not bound by any custom. The self of\nthe child is nothing at all like the self of the grownup man. The second sign\nis that one who has seen God does not care for his body or his dress. Purity\nand impurity seem to him the same. Third, Such an one sometimes acts like a\nmadman, now laughing, now weeping, and the next moment talking to himself; now\ndressed like a Babu (gentleman) and now taking his one garment under his arm\nand going quite naked like\n\np. 238\n\na child. Lastly, he may remain inert and motionless for a long time in the\nstate of Samadhi.\n\nDevotee: After God-vision does egoism (Ahamkara) disappear entirely?\n\nBhagavan: Sometimes the Lord wipes out the last stain of egoism, as in the\nstate of Samadhi. Again, sometimes He leaves a faint trace of egoism, but that\nis harmless. It is like that of an innocent child, who knows not the doing of\ninjury to anyone. The steel sword is turned into gold by the touch of the\nPhilosopher\'s Stone. It still retains its shape but it does not injure anyone.\n\nBhagavan to Mozoomdar: You have been to England and America. Tell me all about\nwhat you saw there.\n\nMozoomdar: Sir, people in England mostly worship what Thou callest Kanchan\n(gold), but there are some good men and women who are not so attached to\nworldliness. Generally speaking, one sees nothing but worldly activity (Rajas)\neverywhere from beginning to end.\n\nAttachment to work.Bhagavan: I have seen the same thing too. Why in England\nand America alone? Attachment to work is to be found in every country. That\nworldly activity is the first chapter of life. So long\n\np. 239\n\nas the Rajas quality predominates, attachment to work increases. One cares\nmore for one\'s own worldly good,--riches, honor, fame. It gradually leads to\nignorance which makes one forget God, the Reality of the universe. God cannot\nbe realized until the Sattwa qualities, such as devotion, right\ndiscrimination, dispassion and compassion for all, prevail. All attachment to\nlust and gold proceeds from Rajas and Tamas qualities, but work cannot be\nrenounced entirely. Propelled by nature (Prakriti) you plunge into work even\nagainst your wish. Therefore I say you should work with non-attachment; in\nother words, you should work without seeking the fruit.\n\nIn a great religious ceremony we give alms to the poor and do various other\ncharitable works and may think that we are absolutely unattached to the\nresults of such works, but in the end we find that the desire for name and\nfame has crept up in the heart, we do not know how. But he alone who has seen\nand realized God can become absolutely unattached to work and its result.\n\nA devotee: What is the path for those who have not realized God? Is it\nnecessary for them to give up all work and worldly activity?\n\np. 240\n\nPath of devotion.Ramakrishna: In this age (Kali-Yuga) the path of devotion and\nlove (Bhakti-Yoga) is easy for all. The practice of Narada\'s Bhakti is better\nadapted to this Yuga. One should repeat the Holy Name of the Lord and chant\nHis praises and with earnest and sincere heart, pray to Him, saying: "O Lord,\ngrant me Thy divine Wisdom, Thy divine Love. Do Thou open my eyes and make me\nrealize Thee."\n\nWhen Karma Yoga is so difficult to practice, one should pray to the Lord in\nthis manner: "O Lord! Do Thou reduce our Karma to a minimum, and the little\nwork that we daily perform, may we do it with non-attachment by Thy grace. O\nLord! Do not let our desire for work increase in number and bind us to\nworldliness."\n\nIs work the aim of life?Devotee: People of the West (in England and America)\nalways say, "Work, work, work." Is not work (Karma) then the end and aim of\nlife?\n\nRamakrishna: The end and aim of life is the attainment of God. Work (Karma) is\nnothing but the first chapter of life; how can it be its end and aim? But\nwork, without seeking the result, is a means, not the end.\n\np. 241\n\nNo one, however, can avoid work (Karma). Every mental action is a Karma. "I am\nthinking," "I meditate," "I feel," each of these is a Karma. The more one\nattains to true devotion the less becomes one\'s worldly work. The pleasures of\nthe world do not satisfy such a soul. They lose their charm. How can one who\nhas tasted the _Sherbet_ made with pure crystallized sugar be pleased with the\ntaste of a drink made with molasses or treacle? On one occasion a Karma Yogi\n(Sambhu) said to me: "May Thy blessing be that my wealth be spent in building\nhospitals and dispensaries, in making roads, in sinking wells for travelers,\nin establishing schools, colleges, and in other good works." Whereupon I\nreplied: "Sambhu, all these works are good when they are performed with non-\nattachment. But that is very difficult. In any case you should always keep in\nmind that the end and aim of your human existence is the attainment of God and\nnot hospitals and dispensaries. Suppose the Lord appears before you and\ngraciously offers to fulfill your desires. Will you then pray for dispensaries\nand hospitals, tanks and wells, roads and serais, or will you say: \'O Lord!\nGrant that I may have pure and unalloyed\n\np. 242\n\nAttainment of God-vision.love for Thee and unswerving devotion to Thy feet,\nthat I may always feel Thy presence and realize Thee under all conditions\'?"\nHospitals, dispensaries and all these things are transitory; God alone is the\nReality, all else is unreal. Once placed face to face with the Vision Divine,\nwe see them as no better than dreams and then we pray for more light, more\nwisdom, more Divine Love, the love which lifts a man to God, the love which\nmakes us realize that we are really sons of the Supreme Being, of whom all\nthat can be said is that He exists, that He is Knowledge itself in the highest\nsense, and that He is the Eternal Fountain of Love and Bliss. Again, when one\nattains to God-vision, one feels that God alone is the real Actor in the\nuniverse, the Doer of all things, and that we can do nothing. If God does\neverything, then why, instead of realizing Him, shall we get entangled in the\nmeshes of worldly works? First realize God; then, if it be His will, many\nhospitals and dispensaries may be established. Therefore, I say, never lose\nsight of this goal of life that I have pointed out for you, but move onward\nthrough the practices of devotion and love. When you have advanced far enough\nyou will know that God alone is the Reality,\n\np. 243\n\nthat all the things of the world are unreal and that the highest end and aim\nof life is the attainment of God.\n\nParable of a wood-cutter.There was a wood-cutter who led a very miserable life\nwith the small means he could procure by daily selling a load of wood brought\nfrom a neighboring forest. Once a Sannyasin, who was passing that way, saw him\nat work and advised him to go further into the forest, saying: "Move onward,\nmy child, move onward." The woodcutter obeyed the injunction and proceeded\nonward until he came to a sandalwood-tree, and being much pleased, he took\naway with him as many sandal logs as he could carry, sold them in the market\nand derived much profit. Then he began to wonder within himself why the good\nSannyasin had not told him anything about the wood of the sandal-tree, but had\nsimply advised him to move onward. So the next day he went on beyond the place\nof the sandalwood until he came upon a copper-mine, and he took with him all\nthe copper that he could carry, and selling it in the market, got more money\nby it. Next day, without stopping at the copper-mine, he proceeded further\nstill, as the Sadhu had advised him to do, and he\n\np. 244\n\ncame upon a silver-mine and took with him as much of it as he could carry,\nsold it and got even more money, and so daily proceeding further and further,\nhe found gold-mines and diamond-mines and at last became exceedingly rich.\nSuch is also the case with the man who aspires after true Knowledge. If he\ndoes not stop in his progress after attaining a few extraordinary and\nsupernatural powers, he at last becomes really rich in the eternal knowledge\nof Truth.\n\nSo go on, my children, and never lose sight of your ideal! Go onward and never\nstop until you have reached the goal. Arriving at a particular stage, do not\nget the idea that you have reached your journey\'s end. Work is only the first\nstage of the journey. Bear in mind that doing works _unattached_ is\nexceedingly difficult, that therefore Bhakti Yoga, the path of love, is better\nsuited to this age, and that work, even if unattached, is not the end of your\nlife, but only a means to an end. So march on and never halt till you have\ncome up to the great Ideal of your life--the realization of God.\n\nReferring to lectures given by members of religious bodies like the Brahmo\nSamaj and\n\np. 245\n\nLectures and sermons of preachers.[paragraph continues] Harisabha, * the\nBhagavan said: One can form an estimate of a man from the lectures he\ndelivers. A pandit was lecturing as the preceptor (\xc3\x82charya) of a certain\nHarisabha. In the course of his sermon he said: "The Lord has not _Rasa_\n(sweetness). Let us make Him sweet by giving Him our love and devotion." By\nsweetness he meant love and tenderness.\n\nStory of a boy and the cow-house.It reminded me of the story in which a boy\nwas trying to convince his friends that his uncle had a great many horses by\nsaying, he had a whole cow-house full of horses. Of course any intelligent\nperson could at once see that a cow-house was not the same as a stable and\nthat horses are never kept in a cow-house. What would people think after\nhearing such absurd statements? They would laugh and come to the conclusion\nthat the uncle had no horses at all. See how absurd it is to say that God is\ndevoid of sweetness, God I who is the Fountain-head of all sweet and tender\nqualities!\n\nThen turning to Mozoomdar the Bhagavan said: You are an educated and\nintelligent man,\n\np. 246\n\nyou are a deep thinker. Keshab and yourself were like the brothers Gour *\n(Chaitanya) and Netai. \xe2\x80\xa0 You have had enough of this world--enough of\nlectures, controversies, schisms and the rest. Do you still care for them?\nNow, it is high time for you to collect your scattered mind and turn towards\nGod. Plunge into the ocean of Divinity.\n\nMozoomdar: Yes, Revered Sir, that I ought to do. There is no doubt about it.\nBut all this I do simply to preserve Keshab\'s name and reputation.\n\nStory of a man and his cottage.Ramakrishna (smiling): You believe that you are\ndoing all this, as you say, for Keshab, but after a while this idea will\nchange and you will think differently, Let me tell you a story. A man built a\ncottage on a mountain-top. It cost him hard labor and much money. After a few\ndays there arose a cyclone and the cottage began to rock to and fro. He was\nvery anxious to save\n\np. 247\n\nit, so he prayed to the Wind-god, saying: "Lord, I beseech thee, do not\ndestroy this cottage"; but the Wind-god did not listen. He prayed again, but\nthe cottage kept on rocking. Then he thought out a plan to save it. He\nremembered that in the mythology Hanuman was the son of the Wind-god.\nInstantly he cried out: "Lord, I beg of Thee, spare this cottage, for it\nbelongs to Hanuman, Thy son." But the Wind-god did not listen. Then he said,\n"Lord, I pray Thee, spare this cottage, for it belongs to Hanuman\'s Lord,\nRama." Still the Wind-god did not listen. Then, as the cottage was about to\ntopple over, the man, to save his life, ran out of it and began to swear,\nsaying: "Let it go to destruction! What is that to me?" You may now be anxious\nto preserve Keshab\'s name; but console yourself with the thought that it was\nafter all owing to God\'s will that the religious movement connected with his\nname was set on foot, and that if the movement has had its day, it is also\nowing to that same Divine will. Therefore dive deep into the sea. And the\nBhagavan sang:\n\n1\\. Dive deep, dive deep, dive deep, O my mind! into the sea of Beauty.\n\np. 248\n\n[paragraph continues] Make a search in the regions lower, still lower below\nthe bottom of the sea:  \nThou wilt surely find the jewel of _Prema_ (intense love of God).\n\n2\\. Within thy heart Vrindavan (the abode of the God of Love).  \nSearch, search, search; searching Thou wilt find it.  \nThen in the heart shall burn, burn, burn the Lamp of Wisdom without ceasing.\n\n3\\. Who is it that steers the boat on land, on land, on land?  \nSays Kuvir: Listen, listen, listen; meditate on the Lotus feet of Guru.\n\nDo you hear the song? You have finished your lectures, quarrels and fights.\nNow dive in this ocean. There is no fear of death in this sea. It is the sea\nof Immortality. Do not fear that one becomes unbalanced by meditating on God.\nI once said to Narendra (Vivekananda)--\n\nMozoomdar (interrupting): Who is this Narendra?\n\nBhagavan: Oh, there is a young man of that\n\np. 249\n\nGod, the sea of Immortality.name. Well, I said to Narendra: "God is like a sea\nof immortal syrup. Would you not dive deep into this sea? Suppose, my boy,\nthere is a basin containing the syrup of sugar and that you are a fly anxious\nto drink of the sweet liquid. Where would you sit and drink?" Narendra said in\nreply: "Why! from the edge of the basin! If I go far from the edge I may be\ndrowned and lose my life." Thereupon I said to him: "My boy, in the sea of\nDivinity there is no fear of that kind. Do you not know that it is the sea of\nImmortality? Whosoever dives into this sea does not die but obtains\neverlasting life." He who is mad after God can never become unbalanced or\ninsane. (To the Bhaktas)\n\nWork without devotion.Work without devotion (Bhakti) to God has in this age no\nground to stand upon. First cultivate devotion (Bhakti); all other things--\nschools, dispensaries, and charitable works shall, if you wish, be added unto\nyou. First devotion, then work. Work, apart from devotion or love of God, is\nhelpless and cannot stand.\n\nMozoomdar made inquiries about the disciples. He asked whether those who came\nto the Bhagavan were getting better in the spirit\n\np. 250\n\nIdeal of a wet-nurse.day by day. The Bhagavan said: I place before them the\nideal of a wet-nurse as teaching them how to live in this world. The maid-\nservant referring to her master\'s house says, "This is our house." All the\nwhile she knows that her home is far away in a distant village, to which her\nthoughts are all sent forth. Again, referring to the master\'s child in her\narms, she will say: "My Hari has grown very wicked," or "My Hari likes to eat\nthis or that," and so on. But all the while she knows that Han is not her own.\nI tell those who come to me to live a life unattached like this maid-servant.\nI tell them to live unattached to this world, to be in the world but not of\nthe world, and at the same time to have their mind directed to God, the\nheavenly home from whence all come. I tell them to pray for love of God\n(Bhakti), which will help them so to live.\n\nAgnosticism in Europe and America.After a short time the conversation turned\non the agnosticism of Europe and America, and Mozoomdar said: Whatever people\nin the West may profess to be, none of them, as it seems to me, is an atheist\nat heart. The European thinkers all admit an unknown Power behind the\nuniverse.\n\np. 251\n\nBhagavan: How can they be atheists when they believe in Sakti, the Eternal\nEnergy?\n\nMozoomdar: They also admit the moral government of the universe.\n\nAs Mozoomdar rose to take leave, the Bhagavan said to him: What shall I say?\nIt is better that you cease to have anything to do with all those things--\nschisms, controversies, etc. All quarrels and disputes spring from egotism and\nattachment to the world. These keep men away from God. Therefore abandon all\nearthly attachment and fix your mind on the Almighty.\n\nv\n\nMozoomdar then saluted the Bhagavan and withdrew. After he had gone, a devotee\nasked: Revered Sir, Thou didst go to see Vidyasagara, what dost Thou think of\nhim?\n\nRamakrishna: Vidyasagara is a very learned scholar. He is kind and charitable,\nbut he has no spiritual consciousness. There is gold inside; if he had been\naware of it, he could not have devoted so much of his time to external work.\nEventually his work would have been finished. If he knew that God was dwelling\nwithin his heart, his mind would have been fixed in\n\np. 252\n\nthinking and meditating on Him. Some people have to perform work without\nattachment for a long time before true dispassion for the world comes; then\nthe mind runs towards God and becomes absorbed in Him. Whatever work\nVidyasagara has done for others has been very good and helpful. Compassion and\nattachment.To be kind and compassionate is also good; but there is a\ndifference between compassion and attachment. Compassion is good, but\nattachment is not. Attachment is love for wife, children, brother, sister,\nfather, mother and other relatives, while true compassion is equal love for\nall living creatures.\n\nMahendra: Is compassion also a bondage?\n\nSattwa, Rajas, and Tamas.Ramakrishna: This question is not for ordinary\nmortals. Compassion is the result of the Sattwa quality. The Sattwa quality is\nprotective, the Rajas quality is creative, and Tamas is destructive: but\nBrahman the Absolute is beyond these three qualities, Sattwa, Rajas, and\nTamas. It is also beyond Prakriti or nature. Where there is absolute Reality,\nno quality of nature can reach. As a thief cannot go to the exact spot where\nthe treasure is, because he is afraid of being caught, so Sattwa, Rajas, and\nTamas, like\n\np. 253\n\nthieves, cannot go to the realm where is the treasure of the Absolute.\n\nParable of the three robbers.A man was going through the woods. On his way he\nwas caught by a band of three robbers. They took away everything he had. Then\nthe first robber asked: "What is the use of keeping this man alive?" And\ndrawing his sword, he was about to kill him, when the second robber stopped\nhim, saying: "What good will be done by killing him? Tie his hands and feet\nand throw him to one side." So they bound his hands and feet and went away\nleaving him by the roadside. After they had been gone for a while, the third\nrobber returned and said to him: "Ah! are you hurt? Come, let me untie the\ncords and release you." Then when he had removed the cords, he said: "Now come\nwith me. I will show you the road." After walking for a long distance, they\nfound the road, and then the robber said: "Look, there is your home. Follow\nthe road and you will soon reach it." The man, thanking him, replied: "Sir,\nyou have done me a great service. I am greatly obliged to you. Will you not\ncome with me to my house?" The robber answered: "No, I cannot go there; the\nguard would find me out."\n\np. 254\n\nThree Gunas of nature.This world is the wilderness. The three robbers are the\nthree Gunas of nature,--Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas. Jiva or the individual soul\nis the traveler; self-knowledge is his treasure. The Tamas quality tries to\ndestroy the Jiva, the Rajas quality binds him with the fetters of the world,\nbut the Sattwa quality protects him from the actions of Rajas and Tamas. By\ntaking refuge with the Sattwa quality, Jiva becomes free from lust and anger,\nwhich are effects of Tamas; the Sattwa quality also emancipates the Jiva or\nthe individual soul from the bondage of the world. But Sattwa quality itself\nis also a robber. It cannot give Divine wisdom or the knowledge of the\nAbsolute. It leads one, however, up to the path of the Supreme Abode and then\nit says: "Behold, there is thy home!" Then it disappears. Even the Sattwa\nquality cannot go near the abode of the Absolute.\n\nAbout the Absolute nothing can be told.What the Absolute is no one can tell.\nHe who has attained the Absolute can not give any information about it. Four\ntravelers discovered a place enclosed by a high wall, with no opening\nanywhere. They were very anxious to see what\n\np. 255\n\nParable of the four travelers.was inside. So one of them climbed to the top of\nthe wall and as he looked in, he shouted with amazement and joy, "Ha! ha! ha!"\nand without giving any information to his fellow-travellers, he jumped inside.\nThe others did likewise. Whoever climbs to the top of the wall jumps inside\nwith extreme joy and never comes back to give the news of what he has found.\nSuch is the realm of the Absolute. The great souls who have realized the\nAbsolute have not come back, because after attaining the highest knowledge of\nBrahman, one absolutely loses the sense of "I." The mind ceases to be active,\nand all sense-consciousness vanishes. This state is called Brahma-Jnana or\nDivine wisdom.\n\nA devotee: Revered Sir, did not the perfected soul Sukadeva attain to Brahma-\nJnana, the Knowledge of the Absolute?\n\nRamakrishna: Some say that Sukadeva saw the ocean of the Absolute Brahman and\ntouched its waters, but he did not go into the water; therefore he was able to\ncome back and teach mankind. Others believe that he attained to the Absolute\nBrahman and then returned to help humanity.\n\nDevotee: Does sectarianism exist after the\n\np. 256\n\nknowledge of the Absolute (Brahma-Jnana) has been attained?\n\nSectarianism and Brahma-Jnana.Ramakrishna: I was talking with Keshab Sen of\nthis Brahma-Jnana. Keshab asked me to say more about the Absolute. I replied:\n"If I say more, your sect and creed will vanish." Keshab answered: "Revered\nSir, then I do not wish to hear more." Still, I said to Keshab: "\'I, me,\nmine,\' this is ignorance; \'I am the doer,\' \'I am the actor,\' \'This is my wife,\nthese are my children, my property, wealth, fame,\' all these arise from\nignorance." Keshab replied: "Revered Sir, nothing will be left, if the sense\nof \'I\' be abandoned." The unripe and ripe "I."I answered: "Keshab, I do not\nask you to abandon the whole of the sense of \'I\'; but leave out the unripe\n\'I\'--\'I am the doer,\' \'my wife, my children, I am the teacher,\' abandoning\nthis sense of \'I,\' retain the ripe \'I\'--\'I am His servant, I am His devotee,\'\n\'I am not the doer, but He is the Actor.\'"\n\nDevotee: Can the ripe "I" make a sect?\n\nRamakrishna: I said to Keshab: "I am the leader of a sect, I have founded a\nsect, I am teaching others, all these proceed from the sense of the unripe\n\'I.\'" Therefore I asked\n\np. 257\n\nKeshab and his disciples.[paragraph continues] Keshab to abandon this "I." I\nalso said to him: "You talk of your sect, many members of your sect have\nresigned." Keshab replied: "Revered Sir, after remaining for three years under\nmy instructions, they have now joined another sect, and at the time of\nleaving, they criticised and slandered me." I said to him: "You do not\nunderstand the inner nature of your disciples. You must study their\npredominant traits and you must not make disciples indiscriminately."\n\nRam Babu *: Bhagavan, I do not see what good has been done by the New\nDispensation of Keshab Sen. If Keshab himself had realized God, the condition\nof his disciples and followers would have been different. In my opinion he has\nhad no realization.\n\nSri Ramakrishna: Oh yes, he must have some realization; otherwise why should\nso many people honor and respect him? Why do they not honor and respect the\nleaders of other branches of the Brahmo-Samaj in the same\n\np. 258\n\nway? Without Divine will no one can command such respect from the masses. A\nspiritual leader must renounce the world.A man cannot become a true spiritual\nleader unless he practises absolute renunciation. Without this people will\nhave no faith in him. They will say: "This man is worldly. He himself enjoys\nthe pleasures of the flesh and wealth, yet he tells us that God is Truth while\nthe world is unreal like a dream." The world will not receive his teachings\nunless he has renounced everything. A few people may listen to him and follow\nhim. Keshab Sen was in the world and had his mind on worldly things. He tried\nto support his family by giving lectures and by marrying his daughter to a\nprince, thus protecting his worldly relations and social position. Why God\ncannot be seen.Once Keshab asked me: "Why can I not see God?" I answered:\n"Because you have absorbed yourself in seeking the honor and respect of\npeople, in education and so on. So long as the child is absorbed in playing\nwith its dolls, the mother does not come. But when the child throws away the\ndoll and cries for the mother, the mother cannot stay away. You think that you\nare a leader, but the Divine Mother thinks: \'My child believes that he has\nbecome a leader\n\np. 259\n\nand is happy; let him enjoy his belief.\'" The Absolute and the Divine Mother.I\nalso told him to believe in the Divine Mother, that the Absolute and the\nDivine Mother are one. The Divine Mother is the eternal Energy. They are\ninseparable. They appear as separate so long as we are conscious of the body\nand as we try to describe them by words. Eventually Keshab believed in the\nDivine Mother. Once he came with his disciples to see me. I asked him to give\na lecture, so he delivered his lecture and after it I had a long talk with\nhim. God, His devotee and His word one.I said: He who is the Personal God\nmanifests in one form as His devotee and in another form as His word." Then I\nwent on to say to him: "You are living in the realm of Maya (worldliness).\nThis Maya does not let anyone know God. It keeps all in ignorance."\n\nDelusive power of Maya.How wonderful is its power! It entangles even a Divine\nIncarnation and makes Him suffer from hunger, thirst, sorrow, misery, like an\nordinary mortal. Do you not see how Rama, the Divine Incarnation, suffered for\nSita? How with great sorrow, He wept bitterly when Sita was stolen away from\nHim? In the Hindu mythology there is a story\n\np. 260\n\nVishnu as a boar.that Vishnu incarnated in the form of a boar to destroy the\ndemons; but after destroying the demons, He did not care to return to his\nHeaven, He wanted to live as a boar. He had some little ones and He was happy\nwith them. The Devas of the heaven thought: "How is it that our Lord does not\ncome back? What has happened?" Then they went to Shiva and asked Him to\npersuade Vishnu to return to His heaven. Shiva came and entreated Him, but He\nwas taking care of His young ones and paid no heed. Then Shiva tore open His\nbody with His triad and freed Him from His self-delusion. Vishnu then laughed\nand returned to His heavenly abode. Such is the power of Maya! To go beyond\nits realm and rise above the Gunas (qualities) is extremely difficult. He who\nhas attained to God has transcended Maya with its qualities.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[225:*](gork11.htm#fr_66) See note page [177](gork08.htm#page_177).\n\n[226:*](gork11.htm#fr_67) See note page [191](gork09.htm#page_191).\n\n[232:*](gork11.htm#fr_68) Tulsi Das was a great Hindu poet who lived between\n1544 and 1624 A.D.
