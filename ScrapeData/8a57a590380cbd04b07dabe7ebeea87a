He, the sun, without any colour, who with set purpose 1 by means of his\npower ( _s_ akti) produces endless colours 2, in whom all this comes together\nin the beginning, and comes asunder in the end--may he, the god, endow us with\ngood thoughts 3.\n\n2\\. That (Self) indeed is Agni (fire), it is \xc3\x82ditya (sun), it is Vayu (wind),\nit is _K_ andramas (moon); the same also is the starry firmament 4, it is\nBrahman (Hira _n_ yagarbha), it is water, it is Pra _g_ apati (Vira _g_ ).\n\n3\\. Thou art woman, thou art man; thou art youth, thou art maiden; thou, as an\nold man, totterest 5 along on thy staff; thou art born with thy face turned\neverywhere.\n\n4\\. Thou art the dark-blue bee, thou art the green\n\np. 250\n\nparrot with red eyes, thou art the thunder-cloud, the seasons, the seas. Thou\nart without beginning 1, because thou art infinite, thou from whom all worlds\nare born.\n\n5 2. There is one unborn being (female), red, white, and black, uniform, but\nproducing manifold offspring. There is one unborn being (male) who loves her\nand lies by her; there is another who leaves her, while she is eating what has\nto be eaten.\n\np. 251\n\n6 1. Two birds, inseparable friends, cling to the same tree. One of them eats\nthe sweet fruit, the other looks on without eating.\n\n7\\. On the same tree man sits grieving, immersed, bewildered, by his own\nimpotence (an-i _s_ a). But when he sees the other lord (i _s_ a) contented,\nand knows his glory, then his grief passes away.\n\n8 2. He who does not know that indestructible being of the _Ri_ g-Veda, that\nhighest ether-like (Self) wherein all the gods reside, of what use is the _Ri_\ng-Veda to him? Those only who know it, rest contented.\n\n9\\. That from which the maker (mayin 3) sends forth all this--the sacred\nverses, the offerings, the sacrifices, the panaceas, the past, the future, and\nall\n\np. 252\n\nthat the Vedas declare--in that the other is bound up through that maya.\n\n10\\. Know then Prak _ri_ ti (nature) is Maya (art), and the great Lord the\nMayin (maker); the whole world is filled with what are his members.\n\n11\\. If a man has discerned him, who being one only, rules over every germ\n(cause), in whom all this comes together and comes asunder again, who is the\nlord, the bestower of blessing, the adorable god, then he passes for ever into\nthat peace.\n\n12 1. He, the creator and supporter of the gods, Rudra, the great seer, the\nlord of all, who saw 2, Hira _n_ yagarbha being born, may he endow us with\ngood thoughts.\n\n13\\. He who is the sovereign of the gods, he in whom all the worlds 3 rest, he\nwho rules over all two-footed and four-footed beings, to that god 4 let us\nsacrifice an oblation.\n\n14\\. He who has known him who is more subtile than subtile, in the midst of\nchaos, creating all things, having many forms, alone enveloping everything 5,\nthe happy one ( _S_ iva), passes into peace for ever.\n\np. 253\n\n15\\. He also was in time 1 the guardian of this world, the lord of all, hidden\nin all beings. In him the Brahmarshis and the deities are united 2, and he who\nknows him cuts the fetters of death asunder.\n\n16\\. He who knows _S_ iva (the blessed) hidden in all beings, like the subtile\nfilm that rises from out the clarified butter 3, alone enveloping everything,\n--he who knows the god, is freed from all fetters.\n\n17\\. That god, the maker of all things, the great Self 4, always dwelling in\nthe heart of man, is perceived by the heart, the soul, the mind 5;--they who\nknow it become immortal.\n\n18\\. When the light has risen 6, there is no day, no night, neither existence\nnor non-existence 7; _S_ iva (the blessed) alone is there. That is the\neternal, the adorable light of Savit _ri_  8,--and the ancient wisdom\nproceeded thence.\n\n19\\. No one has grasped him above, or across, or in the middle 9. There is no\nimage of him whose name is Great Glory.\n\n20\\. His form cannot be seen, no one perceives him with the eye. Those 10 who\nthrough heart and\n\np. 254\n\nmind know him thus abiding in the heart, become immortal.\n\n21\\. 'Thou art unborn,' with these words some one comes near to thee,\ntrembling. O Rudra, let thy gracious 1 face protect me for ever!\n\n22 2. O Rudra! hurt us not in our offspring and descendants, hurt us not in\nour own lives, nor in our cows, nor in our horses! Do not slay our men in thy\nwrath, for, holding oblations, we call on thee always.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[249:1](sbe15103.htm#fr_780) Nihitartha, explained by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara as g _ri_\nhitaprayo _g_ ana _h_ svarthanirapeksha _h_. This may mean with set purpose,\nbut if we read ag _ri_ hitaprayo _g_ ana _h_ it would mean the contrary,\nnamely, without any definite object, irrespective of his own objects. This is\npossible, and perhaps more in accordance with the idea of creation as\npropounded by those to whom the devatma _s_ akti is maya. Nihita would then\nmean hidden.\n\n[249:2](sbe15103.htm#fr_781) Colour is intended for qualities, differences,\n&c.\n\n[249:3](sbe15103.htm#fr_782) This verse has been translated very freely. As it\nstands, vi _k_ aiti _k_ ante vi _s_ vam adau sa deva _h_ , it does not\nconstrue, in spite of all attempts to the contrary, made by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara. What\nis intended is yasminn ida _m_ sa _m_ _k_ a vi _k_ aiti sarvam (IV, 11); but\nhow so simple a line should have been changed into what we read now, is\ndifficult to say.\n\n[249:4](sbe15103.htm#fr_783) This is the explanation of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, and\nprobably that of the Yoga schools in India at his time. But to take _s_ ukram\nfor diptiman nakshatradi, brahma for Hira _n_ yagarbha, and Pra _g_ apati for\nVira _g_ seems suggested by this verse only.\n\n[249:5](sbe15103.htm#fr_784) Va _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ayasi, an exceptional form, instead of\nva _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ asi (A. B.)\n\n[250:1](sbe15103.htm#fr_785) We see throughout the constant change from the\nmasculine to the neuter gender, in addressing either the lord or his true\nessence.\n\n[250:2](sbe15103.htm#fr_786) This is again one of the famous verses of our\nUpanishad, because it formed for a long time a bone of contention between\nVedanta and Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya philosophers. The Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khyas admit two principles, the\nPurusha, the absolute subject, and the Prak _ri_ ti, generally translated by\nnature. The Vedanta philosophers admit nothing but the one absolute subject,\nand look upon nature as due to a power inherent in that subject. The later\nSa\xe1\xb9\x85khyas therefore, who are as anxious as the Vedantins to find authoritative\npassages in the Veda, confirming their opinions, appeal to this and other\npassages, to show that their view of Prak _ri_ ti, as an independent power, is\nsupported by the Veda. The whole question is fully discussed in the Vedanta-\nsutras I, 4, 8. Here we read rohita-k _ri_ sh _n_ a- _s_ uklam, which seems\npreferable to lohita-k _ri_ sh _n_ a-var _n_ am, at least from a Vedanta point\nof view, for the three colours, red, black, and white, are explained as\nsignifying either the three gunas, ra _g_ as, sattva, and tamas, or better (\n_Kh_ and. Up. VI, 3, 1), the three elements, te _g_ as (fire), ap (water), and\nanna (earth). A. reads rohita _s_ uklak _ri_ sh _n_ am; B. lohita _s_\nuklakrish _n_ a (sic). We also find in A. and B. bhuktabhogam for\nbhuktabhogyam, but the latter seems technically the more correct reading. It\nwould be quite wrong to imagine that a _g_ a and a _g_ a are meant here for\nhe-goat and she-goat. These words, in the sense of unborn, are recognised as\nearly as the hymns of the _Ri_ g-veda, and they occurred in our Upanishad I,\n9, where the two a _g_ as are mentioned in the same sense as here. But there\nis, no doubt, a play on the words, and the poet wished to convey the second\nmeaning of he-goat and she-goat, only not as the primary, but as the secondary\nintention.\n\n[251:1](sbe15103.htm#fr_787) The same verses occur in the Mundaka Up. III, 1.\n\n[251:2](sbe15103.htm#fr_788) It is difficult to see how this verse comes in\nhere. In the Taitt. \xc3\x82r. II, 11, 6, it is quoted in connection with the\nsyllable Om, the Akshara, in which all the Vedas are comprehended. It is\nsimilarly used in the N _ri_ si _m_ ha-purva-tapani, IV, 2; V, 2. In our\npassage, however, akshara is referred by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara to the paramatman, and I\nhave translated it accordingly. _Ri_ _k_ a _h_ is explained as a genitive\nsingular, but it may also be taken as a nom. plur., and in that case both the\nverses of the Veda and the gods are said to reside in the Akshara, whether we\ntake it for the Paramatman or for the Om. In the latter case, parame vyoman is\nexplained by utk _ri_ sh _t_ e and rakshake.\n\n[251:3](sbe15103.htm#fr_789) it is impossible to find terms corresponding to\nmaya and mayin. Maya means making, or art, but as all making or creating, so\nfar as the Supreme Self is concerned, is phenomenal only or mere illusion,\nmaya conveys at the same time the sense of illusion. In the same manner mayin\nis the maker, the artist, but also the magician or juggler. What seems\nintended by our verse is that from the akshara which corresponds to brahman,\nall proceeds, whatever exists or seems to exist, but that the actual creator\nor the author of all emanations is \xc3\x8e _s_ a, the Lord, who, as creator, is\nacting through maya or devatma _s_ akti. Possibly, however, anya, the other,\nmay be meant for the individual purusha.\n\n[252:1](sbe15103.htm#fr_790) See before, III, 4.\n\n[252:2](sbe15103.htm#fr_791) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara does not explain this verse again,\nthough it differs from III, 4. Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman explains pa _s_ yata by apa\n_s_ yata, and qualifies the \xc3\x82tmanepada as irregular.\n\n[252:3](sbe15103.htm#fr_792) B. reads yasmin deva _h_ , not A.\n\n[252:4](sbe15103.htm#fr_793) I read tasmai instead of kasmai, a various\nreading mentioned by Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman. It was easy to change tasmai into\nkasmai, because of the well-known line in the _Ri_ g-veda, kasmai devaya\nhavisha vidhema. Those who read kasmai, explain it as a dative of Ka, a name\nof Pra _g_ apati, which in the dative should be kaya, and not kasmai. It would\nbe better to take kasmai as the dative of the interrogative pronoun. See M.\nM., History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 433; and Vitana-sutras IV, 22.\n\n[252:5](sbe15103.htm#fr_794) Cf. III, 7.\n\n[253:1](sbe15103.htm#fr_795) In former ages, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara.\n\n[253:2](sbe15103.htm#fr_796) Because both the Brahmarshis, the holy seers, and\nthe deities find their true essence in Brahman.\n\n[253:3](sbe15103.htm#fr_797) We should say, like cream from milk.\n\n[253:4](sbe15103.htm#fr_798) Or the high-minded.\n\n[253:5](sbe15103.htm#fr_799) See III, 13.\n\n[253:6](sbe15103.htm#fr_800) Atamas, no darkness, i.e. light of knowledge.\n\n[253:7](sbe15103.htm#fr_801) See on the difficulty of translating sat and\nasat, \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd and \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb5 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd, the remarks in the Preface.\n\n[253:8](sbe15103.htm#fr_802) Referring to the Gayatri, _Ri_ g-veda III, 62,\n10; see also _S_ vet. Up. V, 4.\n\n[253:9](sbe15103.htm#fr_803) See Muir, Metrical Translations, p. 198; Maitr.\nUp. VI, 17.\n\n[253:10](sbe15103.htm#fr_804) B. reads h _ri_ da manisha manasabhik _li_ pto,\nyat tad vidur; A. h _ri_ di h _ri_ distham manasaya enam eva _m_ vidur.\n\n[254:1](sbe15103.htm#fr_805) Dakshina is explained either as invigorating,\nexhilarating, or turned towards the south.\n\n[254:2](sbe15103.htm#fr_806) See Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays, I, p. 141;\n_Ri_ g-veda I, 114, 8; Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 5, 10, 3; Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XVI,\n16. The various readings are curious. \xc3\x82yushi in the _S_ vet. Up., instead of\nayau in the _Ri_ g-veda, is supported by the Taitt. Sa _m_ h. and the Va _g_.\nSa _m_ h.; but Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman reads ayau. As to bhamito, it seems the\nright reading, being supported by the _Ri_ g-veda, the Taitt. Sa _m_ h., and\nthe _S_ vet. Up., while bhavito in Roer's edition is a misprint. The Va _g_.\nSa _m_ h. alone reads bhamino, which Mahidhara refers to viran. The last verse\nin the _Ri_ g-veda and Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. is havishmanta _h_ sadam it tva\nhavamahe; in the Taitt. Sa _m_ h. havishmanto namasa vidhema te. In the _S_\nvet. Up. havishmantah sadasi tva havamahe, as printed by Roer, seems to rest\non _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's authority only. The other commentators, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda and Vi\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman, read and interpret sadam it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Adhyaya V](sbe15104.htm)\n\n"
