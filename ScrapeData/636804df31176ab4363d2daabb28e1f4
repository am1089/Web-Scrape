Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! Who was that Surabhi, who came down from the\nregion of Goloka. I want to hear Her life. Kindly describe.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n2-23. Naraya _n_ a spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Devar _s_ i! The Devi Surabhi sprang in the\nGoloka. She was the first in the creation of cows; and, from Her, all the\nother cows have come. She is the Presiding Deity of the cows. I will now speak\nHer history from the very beginning. Hear. Before, She appeared in the holy\nVrindaban. One day the Lord of Radha, surrounded by the Gopis, was going\ngladly with Radha to the Holy Vrindavan. There he began to enjoy in a solitary\nplace with great pleasure. He is All Will and suddenly a desire arose in His\nmind that He would drink milk. Then He created easily the Devi Surabhi, full\nof milk, with Her calf, from His own left side. The calf of Surabhi is nothing\nelse but Her wish personified. Seeing Surabhi, S\xc2\x92ridama milked Her in a new\nearthen jar. The milk is more sweet than even the nectar and it prevents birth\nand death! The Lord of the Gopis drank the milk. What milk dropped out of the\njar, created a big tank! The tank measured one hundred Yojanas in length and\nin breadth and is known in Goloka by the name of K _s_ irasagara. The Gopikas\nand Radha play therein. At the will of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, Whose Nature is All\nWill, that tank become full of excellent gems and jewels. Then, from every\npore of Surabhi, there appeared suddenly one lakh ko _t_ i Kamadhenus (cows\nwho yields according to one\xc2\x92s desires). So much so that every Gopa who used to\nlive there in Goloka had one Kamadhenu and each house had one such. Their\ncalves again became so many that no limit can be put to them. Thus, by\ndegrees, the whole universe was filled with cows. This is the origin of the\nCow Creation. O Narada! Surabhi was first worshipped by Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_\na. Therefore She is so much honoured everywhere. On the day next the Divali\nnight (new moon in the month of October), Surabhi was worshipped by the\ncommand of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. This is heard from the mouth of Dharma Deva. O\nChild! Now hear the Dhyanam, Stotra, and the method of worship of Surabhi as\n\n\n\np. 1001\n\n\n\nmentioned in the Vedas. I will now speak on this. \xc2\x93Om Surabhyai namah,\xc2\x94 is the\nprincipal six-lettered mantra of Surabhi. If anybody repeats this mantra one\nlakh times, he becomes Siddha in this mantra. This is like Kalpa Vrik _s_ a (a\ntree yielding all desires) to the devotees. The Dhyanam of Surabhi is\nmentioned in the Yajur Vedas. Success, prosperity, increase and freedom come\nas the result of worshipping Surabhi. The Dhyanam runs as follows :-- \xc2\x93O Devi\nSurabhi! Thou art Lak _s_ mi, Thou art best, Thou art Radha; Thou art the\nchief companion of S\xc2\x92ri Radha, Thou art the first and the source of the cow-\ncreation, Thou art holy and Thou sanctifiest the persons; Thou fufillest the\ndesires of the devotees and Thou purifiest the whole universe. Therefore I\nmeditate on Thee.\xc2\x94 Reciting this Dhyanam, the Brahma _n_ as worship the Devi\nSurabhi in jars, on the heads of cows, or on the pegs where cows are fastened\nor on S\xc2\x92alagrama stone or in water or in fire. O Muni! He who worships with\ndevotion on the next day morning after Divali night, becomes also worshipped\nin this world. Once a day in the Varahakalpa Surabhi did not yield milk, by\nthe influence of Vi _sn_ u Maya. The Devas became very anxious. Then they went\nto the Brahmaloka and began to praise Brahma. At His advice, Indra began to\nchant hymns (Stotra) to Surabhi :--\n\n\n\n24-33. The Devendra said :-- \xc2\x93O World-Mother! O Devi! O Maha Devi! O Surabhi!\nThou art the source of the cow creation. Obeisance to Thee! Thou art the dear\ncompanion of Radha; Thou art the part of Kamala; Thou art dear to S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a; Thou art the mother of cows, I bow down to Thee. Thou art like the\nKalpa Vrik _s_ a (a tree yielding all desires), Thou art the Chief of all;\nThou yieldest milk, wealth and prosperity and increase thereof. So I bow down\nto Thee. Thou art auspicious, Thou art good, Thou bestowest cows. Obeisance to\nThee! Thou givest fame, name and Dharma. So I bow down to Thee.\xc2\x94 O Narada!\nThus hearing the praise sung by Indra, the eternal Surabhi, the originator of\nthe world, became very glad and appeared in the Brahmaloka. Granting boon to\nMahendra, so very rare to others and desired by him, Subrabhi went to the\nGoloka. The Devas, also, went back to their own abodes. The whole world was\nnow full of milk; clarified butter came out of the milk; and from clarified\nbutter sacrifices began to be performed and the Devas were fed and they became\npleased. O Child! He who recites this holy Stotra of Surabhi with devotion,\ngets cows, other wealth, name, fame and sons. The reciting of this Stotra\nqualifies one as if he had bathed in all the sacred places of pilgrimages and\nhe had acquired the fruits of all the sacrifices. Enjoying happiness in this\nworld, be goes in\n\n\n\np. 1002\n\n\n\nthe end to the Temple of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. There living long in the service of\nKri _sn_ a, he becomes able to be a son of Brahma.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Forty-ninth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the anecdote of Surabhi\nin the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_\ni Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 50](bk09ch50.htm)\n\n'
