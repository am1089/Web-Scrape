Such is my request, O youth!\n\nSanatsu _g_ ata said:\n\nThis Brahman, O king! about which you question me with such perseverance, is\nnot to be attained by anybody who is in a hurry. When the mind is absorbed in\nthe understanding 2, then can that knowledge, which must be deeply pondered\nover, be attained by living the life of a Brahma _k_ arin 3. For you are\nspeaking of that primordial knowledge 4, which consists in the truth; which is\nobtained by the good by living the life of Brahma _k_ arins 5; which being\nobtained, men cast off this mortal world; and which knowledge, verily, is to\nbe invariably (found) in those who have been brought up under preceptors 6.\n\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra said\n\nSince that knowledge is capable of being truly acquired by living the life of\na Brahma _k_ arin, therefore tell me, O Brahma _n_ a! of what description the\nlife of a Brahma _k_ arin is 7.\n\nSanatsu _g_ ata said:\n\nThose who entering (as it were) the womb 8 of a\n\np. 176\n\npreceptor, and becoming (as it were) a f\xc2\x9ctus, practise the life of Brahma _k_\narins, become even in this world authors of Sastras 1, and they repair to the\nhighest truth 2 after casting off (this) body. They subjugate desires here in\nthis world, practising forbearance in pursuit of the Brahmic state 3; and with\ncourage, they even here remove the self out of the body 4, like the soft\nfibres from the Mu\xc3\xb1 _g_ a. Father and mother, O descendant of Bharata! only\nform the body. But the birth 5 obtained from the preceptor, that verily is\ntrue 6, and likewise immortal. He perfects 7 (one), giving (one) immortality.\nRecognising what he has done (for one), one should not injure him. The\ndisciple should always make obeisance to the preceptor 8; and, free from\nheedlessness, should always desire sacred instruction. When the pure man\nobtains knowledge by this same course of discipleship 9, that is the first\nquarter of his life as a Brahma _k_ arin. As (is) his conduct\n\np. 177\n\nalways towards his preceptor, so likewise should he behave towards the\npreceptor\'s wife, and so likewise should he act towards the preceptor\'s\nson--(that) is said to be the second quarter. What one, recognising what the\npreceptor has done for one, and understanding the matter 1 (taught), feels\nwith a delighted heart regarding the preceptor--believing that one has been\nbrought into existence 2 by him--that is the third quarter of life as a Brahma\n_k_ arin. One should do what is agreeable to the preceptor, by means of one\'s\nlife and riches, and in deed, thought, and word 3\\--that is said to be the\nfourth quarter. (A disciple) obtains a quarter by time 4, so likewise a\nquarter by associating with the preceptor, he also obtains a quarter by means\nof his own energy; and then he attains to a quarter by means of the Sastras.\nThe life as a Brahma _k_ arin of that man, whose beauty 5 consists in the\ntwelve beginning with knowledge, and whose limbs are the other (qualifications\nmentioned), and who has\n\np. 178\n\nstrength 1, bears fruit, they say, by association with a preceptor, in (the\nshape of) contact with that entity--the Brahman. Whatever wealth may come to\nman who lives in this way, he should even pay that over to the preceptor. He\nwould thus be adopting the conduct of the good which is of many merits; and\nthe same conduct is (to be adopted) towards the preceptor\'s son. Living thus,\nhe prospers greatly 2 on all sides in this world; he obtains sons and\nposition; the quarters 3 and sub-quarters shower (benefits 4) on him, and men\npass their lives as Brahma _k_ arins under him. By this life as a Brahma _k_\narin, the divinities obtained their divinity. And the sages, too, became great\nby living the life of Brahma _k_ arins. By this same (means), too, the\nApsarasas, together with the Gandharvas, achieved for themselves beautiful\nforms. And by this life as a Brahma _k_ arin, the sun illuminates (the\nuniverse). That man of knowledge, O king! who practising penance, may by\npenance pierce through or tear off his body, crosses beyond childhood 5 by\nmeans of this (life as a Brahma _k_ arin), and at the time of the termination\n(of life) obstructs death 6. Those who understand this (life as a Brahma _k_\narin) attain to a\n\np. 179\n\ncondition like that of those who as (for what they want) from the wish-giving\nstone 1, when they obtain the thing desired. By performing action, O\nKshatriya! people conquer (for themselves only) perishable worlds 2. (But) the\nman of understanding attains by knowledge to the everlasting glory--for there\nis no other way to it 3.\n\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra said:\n\nWhere a Brahma _n_ a possessed of knowledge, perceives it, does it appear as\nwhite 4, as red, or again as black, or again as grey or tawny? What is the\ncolour of that immortal, indestructible goal?\n\nSanatsu _g_ ata said:\n\nIt appears not as white, as red, nor again as black, nor again as grey, nor\ntawny 5. It dwells not on earth, nor in the sky; nor does it bear a body in\nthis ocean 6 (-like world). It is not in the stars, nor does it dwell in the\nlightning; nor is its form 7 to be seen in the clouds, nor even in the air,\nnor in the deities; it is not to be seen in the moon, nor in the sun. It is\nnot to be seen in _Rik_ texts, nor in\n\np. 180\n\nYa _g_ us texts; nor yet in the Atharvan texts, nor in the pure Saman texts;\nnor yet, O king, in the Rathantara or B _ri_ hadratha 1 hymns. It is seen in\nthe self of a man of high vows 2. It is invincible, beyond darkness 3, it\ncomes forth from within 4 at the time of destruction. Its form is minuter than\nthe minutest (things), its form is larger even than the mountains 5. That is\nthe support 6 (of the universe); that is immortal; (that is) all things\nperceptible 7. That is the Brahman, that is glory 8. From that all entities\nwere produced 9, in that they are dissolved. All this shines forth as dwelling\nin it in the form of light 10. And it is perceived by means of knowledge 11 by\none who understands the self; on it depends this whole universe. Those who\nunderstand this become immortal.\n\np. 181\n\n**\n\nCHAPTER V.**  1\n\nGrief and wrath, and avarice, desire, delusion, laziness, want of forgiveness,\nvanity, craving, friendship 2, censoriousness, and reviling others--these\ntwelve great enormities are destructive of a man\'s life. These, O king of\nkings! attend on each and every man. Beset by these, a man, deluded in his\nunderstanding, acts sinfully. A man full of attachments, merciless, harsh (of\nspeech), talkative, cherishing wrath in his heart, and boastful--these are the\nmen of cruel qualities; (such) persons, even obtaining wealth, do not always\nenjoy (it) 3.\n\np. 182\n\nOne whose thoughts are fixed on enjoyments, who is partial 1, proud 2,\nboastful when he makes a gift, miserly, and devoid of power 3, who esteems the\ngroup (of the senses), and who hates (his) wife--thus have been stated the\nseven (classes of) cruel persons of sinful dispositions. Piety, and\ntruthfulness, and penance, and self-restraint, freedom from animosity,\nmodesty, endurance, freedom from censoriousness, liberality, sacred learning,\ncourage, forgiveness--these are the twelve great observances of a Brahma _n_\na. Whoever does not swerve from these twelve may govern this whole world. And\none who is possessed of three, two, or even one, of these, must be understood\nto have nothing of his own 4. Self-restraint, abandonment, freedom from\ndelusion, on these immortality depends 5. These are possessed by those\ntalented Brahma _n_ as to whom the Brahman is the principal 6 (thing). A\nBrahma _n_ a\'s speaking ill of others, whether true or false, is not\ncommended.\n\np. 183\n\n[paragraph continues] The men who act thus have their places in hell. Frenzy\nhas eighteen defects--as already described here--hatred of men, factiousness\n1, censoriousness, untruthful speech, lust, wrath, wand of self-control 2,\nspeaking ill of others, backbiting, mismanagement in business 3,\nquarrelsomeness, animosity, troubling living creatures, want of forgiveness,\ndelusion, flippancy, loss of reason 4, censoriousness 5; therefore a wise man\nshould not be subject to frenzy, for it is always censured. Six\ncharacteristics should be understood as (belonging) to friendship--that one\nshould rejoice at (anything) agreeable, and feel grieved at (anything)\ndisagreeable; that with a pure heart one, when asked by a deserving (man),\nshould give to him who asks what can 6 certainly be given, (though it) may be\nbeneficial to oneself, and even though it ought not to be asked, (namely) ones\nfavourites, sons, wealth, and one\'s own wife; that one should not dwell there\nwhere one has bestowed (all one\'s) wealth, through a desire (to get a return\nfor one\'s liberality); that one should enjoy (the\n\np. 184\n\nfruit of one\'s 1 own) toils (only); and that one should forego one\'s own\nprofit 2. Such a man, possessed of wealth, and possessed of merits, is a\nliberal man of the quality of goodness 3; such a one diverts the five elements\nfrom the five 4 (senses). This 5 pure penance, acquired out of desire 6 by\nthose who are. fallen off from the truth, even though developed, leads upwards\n7; since sacrifices are performed owing to a misapprehension of the truth 8.\n(The\n\np. 185\n\nsacrifices) of some are by the mind, of others by speech, and also by deed.\nThe man void of fancies takes precedence over the man perfected by fancies,--\nespecially among Brahma _n_ as 1. And hear this further from me. One should\nteach this great and glorious 2 (doctrine); (other doctrines) the wise call\nmere arrangements of words. On this, concentration of mind 3, all this 4\ndepends. Those who know this become immortal. Not by meritorious action only,\nO king! does one conquer the truth 5. One may offer offerings, or sacrifice.\nBy that the child(-like man) does not cross beyond death; nor, O king! does he\nobtain happiness in his last moments 6. One should practise devotion quietly,\nand should not be active even in the mind 7; and then one should avoid delight\nand wrath (resulting) from praise and censure 8. I say to you, O learned\nperson! that adhering to this 9, one attains the Brahman and perceives it, O\nKshatriya! by a course (of study) of the Vedas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[174:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_817) This again is not clear, and the discrepancies of\nthe MSS. make it more perplexing. The meaning, I take to be, that a man may\nperceive all material things, such as the worlds, Bhur, &c. (as the\ncommentators put it), but to be really omniscient, you must have knowledge of\nthe truth--the Brahman. See Sabha Parvan, chapter V, stanza 7. And see, too, B\n_ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 613.\n\n[174:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_818) P. [p. 167](sbe0824.htm#page_167) supra.\n\n[174:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_819) Hearing the Vedantas--Upanishads,\' &c,, says _S_ a\n_n_ kara. See note supra, [p. 173](sbe0824.htm#page_173).\n\n[174:4](sbe0825.htm#fr_820) Does this mean referring to many aspects of the\nBrahman? _S_ a _n_ kara merely says nanarupa. Nilaka _nth_ a takes it\ndifferently, and as meaning that in which everything is elucidated; \'relating\nto the Brahman\' Nilaka _nth_ a takes to mean \'leading to the Brahman,\' or\n\'instrument for attaining to the Brahman.\'\n\n[175:1](sbe0825.htm#fr_821) In this material world, the highest knowledge is\nnot to be got. Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 96.\n\n[175:2](sbe0825.htm#fr_822) I. e. withdrawn from objects and fixed on the self\nonly. Cf. Gita, [p. 79](sbe0810.htm#page_79), and Maitri, p. 179, where,\nhowever, we have h _ri_ d for buddhi.\n\n[175:3](sbe0825.htm#fr_823) Viro _k_ ana and Indra do so according to the _Kh_\nandogya, p. 570 See also Mu _nd_ aka, p. 311.\n\n[175:4](sbe0825.htm#fr_824) The object of which is the primal Brahman.\n\n[175:5](sbe0825.htm#fr_825) Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 534; and Gita, pp.\n[78](sbe0810.htm#page_78), [79](sbe0810.htm#page_79), and the passage from the\nKa _th_ a there cited.\n\n[175:6](sbe0825.htm#fr_826) _Kh_ andogya, pp. 264-459.\n\n[175:7](sbe0825.htm#fr_827) See _Kh_ andogya, p. 553 seq.\n\n[175:8](sbe0825.htm#fr_828) I. e. attending closely upon him; f\xc2\x9ctus = pupil.\n\n[176:1](sbe0825.htm#fr_829) Learned, men of knowledge, _S_ a _n_ kara.\n\n[176:2](sbe0825.htm#fr_830) The supreme, \'which is described as \'truth,\nknowledge,\' &c. In our ancient works the truth often means the real.\n\n[176:3](sbe0825.htm#fr_831) The state of being absorbed in the Brahman. Cf.\nGita, [p. 52](sbe0804.htm#page_52).\n\n[176:4](sbe0825.htm#fr_832) Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 158.\n\n[176:5](sbe0825.htm#fr_833) _S_ a _n_ kara cites \xc3\x82pastamba (p. 11) in support\nof this, and Pra _s_ na-upanishad, p. 256. The consciousness of being one with\nthe Brahman is a new birth. See, too, Mu _nd_ aka, p. 282.\n\n[176:6](sbe0825.htm#fr_834) That birth is not merely delusive, and does not\nresult in death.\n\n[176:7](sbe0825.htm#fr_835) Immortality or final emancipation is not to be\nachieved without knowledge, which can only be got from a preceptor. And one is\nnot perfect without that immortality; one is limited by the conditions of\nhuman existence. See Nirukta (Roth\'s ed.), p. 41.\n\n[176:8](sbe0825.htm#fr_836) _S_ a _n_ kara compares _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p.\n374. The necessity of having a Guru is often insisted on even in the\nUpanishads. Cf. Mu _nd_ aka, p. 282; _Kh_ andogya, p. 264.\n\n[176:9](sbe0825.htm#fr_837) Stated at the beginning of this speech, _S_ a _n_\nkara.\n\n[177:1](sbe0825.htm#fr_838) The meaning of the Vedic texts, &c., _S_ a _n_\nkara in one copy; the highest aim of man, according to another copy.\n\n[177:2](sbe0825.htm#fr_839) See note on p. 176.\n\n[177:3](sbe0825.htm#fr_840) I keep the order of the original, though I do not\ntranslate quite literally; \'thought and word\' should be literally mind and\nspeech.\' See, on the collocation, Gita, [p. 123](sbe0820.htm#page_123) inter\nalia.\n\n[177:4](sbe0825.htm#fr_841) Time = maturity of understanding which comes by\ntime; energy = intellectual power; _S_ astras = consultation about _S_ astras\nwith fellow-students-- _S_ a _n_ kara, who adds that the order is not material\nas stated, and quotes a stanza which may be thus rendered, \'The pupil receives\na quarter from the preceptor, a quarter by his own talent; he receives a\nquarter by time; and a quarter through fellow-Brahma _k_ arins.\n\n[177:5](sbe0825.htm#fr_842) The body being disregarded, these qualities are\nattributed to the self in this way. For the twelve, see [p.\n167](sbe0824.htm#page_167); the others are abandonment, truthfulness, &c., [p.\n169](sbe0824.htm#page_169).\n\n[178:1](sbe0825.htm#fr_843) To observe the duties referred to, _S_ a _n_ kara.\nBut see, too, [p. 167](sbe0824.htm#page_167), note .\n\n[178:2](sbe0825.htm#fr_844) Obtains wealth, learning, and greatness,\' says a\ncommentator. For similar benefits, cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 122.\n\n[178:3](sbe0825.htm#fr_845) Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 132.\n\n[178:4](sbe0825.htm#fr_846) \'Wealth,\' says Nilaka _nth_ a, as well as another\ncommentator.\n\n[178:5](sbe0825.htm#fr_847) Ignorance; cf. note at [p.\n154](sbe0823.htm#page_154) supra. Nilaka _nth_ a reads \'reaches\' instead of\n\'crosses beyond,\' and interprets \'balya\' to mean \'freedom from affection,\naversion,\' &c. Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 605. As to the divinity of\ndivinities, cf. Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_. p. 886.\n\n[178:6](sbe0825.htm#fr_848) Nilaka _nth_ a reads \'vanquishes death.\' The\nmeaning is, he reaches final emancipation. Cf. [p. 154](sbe0823.htm#page_154)\nsupra.\n\n[179:1](sbe0825.htm#fr_849) Called _K_ intama _n_ i. The effect of Brahma _k_\narya is that those who practise it can get what they desire.\n\n[179:2](sbe0825.htm#fr_850) Cf. Gita, [p. 76](sbe0809.htm#page_76); _Kh_\nandogya, p. 538; Mu _nd_ aka, p. 279.\n\n[179:3](sbe0825.htm#fr_851) Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 327.\n\n[179:4](sbe0825.htm#fr_852) Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 877.\n\n[179:5](sbe0825.htm#fr_853) Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 119; and Mu _nd_ aka, p. 267. As\nto its not dwelling in earth, sky, &c., _S_ a _n_ kara refers to _Kh_ andogya,\np. 518, as implying that.\n\n[179:6](sbe0825.htm#fr_854) Literally, \'it bears no water in the ocean.\'\n\'Water\' is said by the commentators to mean the five elements of which the\nbody is composed. See Manu I, 5, and _Kh_ andogya, p. 330. In the _S_ veta _s_\nvatara it signifies mind (See p. 388). For ocean meaning world, or sa _m_\nsara; cf. Aitareya-upanishad, p. 182.\n\n[179:7](sbe0825.htm#fr_855) Here I do not render rupa by colour, as before.\n\n[180:1](sbe0825.htm#fr_856) See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, vol. i, p. 16; Ta _nd_\nya-brahma _n_ a, p. 838; Gita, [p. 90](sbe0812.htm#page_90); and Kaushitaki,\np. 21. B _ri_ hadratha = Brihat-saman (?).\n\n[180:2](sbe0825.htm#fr_857) The twelve great vows--knowledge, &c., mentioned\nabove, see [p. 167](sbe0824.htm#page_167). Nilaka _nth_ a takes Mahavrata to\nrefer to the sacrifice of that name. It is described in the Aitareya \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka.\n\n[180:3](sbe0825.htm#fr_858) See Gita, [p. 78](sbe0810.htm#page_78), note .\n\n[180:4](sbe0825.htm#fr_859) Cf. Gita, [p. 82](sbe0811.htm#page_82), and\n\xc3\x8esopanishad, p. 12.\n\n[180:5](sbe0825.htm#fr_860) See Gita, [p. 78](sbe0810.htm#page_78), note .\n\n[180:6](sbe0825.htm#fr_861) Cf. Gita, [p. 113](sbe0817.htm#page_113); Ka _th_\na p. 99.\n\n[180:7](sbe0825.htm#fr_862) So Nilaka _nth_ a. The original word ordinarily\nmeans \'worlds.\'\n\n[180:8](sbe0825.htm#fr_863) Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 347.\n\n[180:9](sbe0825.htm#fr_864) Cf. the famous passage in the Taittiriya, p. 123:\nand also Mu _nd_ aka, p. 289.\n\n[180:10](sbe0825.htm#fr_865) The explanations of the commentators are not\nquite clear as to the word ahna, \'in the form of light.\' Probably the meaning\nis: The universe depends on the Brahman, and is, as it were, the light of the\nBrahman. _S_ a _n_ kara compares the passages referred to at Gita, [p.\n112](sbe0817.htm#page_112), note .\n\n[180:11](sbe0825.htm#fr_866) \'Not by means of action,\' says _S_ a _n_ kara.\n\n[181:1](sbe0825.htm#fr_867) The whole of this chapter is wanting in one of our\ncopies of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s commentary. In the copy published in the\nMahabharata (Madras edition) there is, however, this passage: \'Wrath &c. have\nbeen already explained, still there are some differences here and there, and\nthose only are now explained.\' The chapter is for the most part a repetition\nof what we have already had. For such repetitions cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka,\npp. 317-1016; 444-930. The same copy of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s commentary gives this\ngeneral statement of the object of this and the next chapter: \'The course of\nstudy of the science of the Brahman, in which knowledge is the principal\nthing, and concentration of mind &c. are subsidiary, has been. described. Now\nis described the course of study in which concentration of mind is principal,\nand knowledge subsidiary. The first mode consists in understanding the meaning\nof the word "you" by means of concentration of mind, and then identifying it\nwith the Brahman by means of a study of the Upanishads; the second, in first\nintellectually understanding the identity of the individual self and Brahman,\nby such study of the Upanishads, and then realising the identity to\nconsciousness by contemplation, &c. In both modes the fruit is the same, and\nthe means are the same; and to show this, the merits and defects already\nstated are here again declared.\' This explanation is verbatim the same in\nNilaka _nth_ a\'s commentary.\n\n[181:2](sbe0825.htm#fr_868) The original is \'pity,\' which is explained to mean\n\'friendship\' by _S_ a _n_ kara and Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[181:3](sbe0825.htm#fr_869) \'Owing to there being in it no enjoyment for the\nself,\' says one p. 182 copy of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s commentary. Another reading,\nwhich is in the Madras edition and in Nilaka _nth_ a, may be rendered, \'even\nobtaining benefits, they do not respect one (from whom they obtain them).\'\n\n[182:1](sbe0825.htm#fr_870) The commentary says the meaning is the same as\nthat of the expression used in the corresponding place before, viz. one who\nprospers by injuring others.\n\n[182:2](sbe0825.htm#fr_871) One copy of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s commentary takes this\nto mean one who thinks the not-self to be the self. I adopt the other meaning,\nhowever, as agreeing, with that of atimani, which is the reading of some\ncopies instead of abhimani.\n\n[182:3](sbe0825.htm#fr_872) Nilaka _nth_ a reads durbala and does not explain\nit. See [p. 167](sbe0824.htm#page_167).\n\n[182:4](sbe0825.htm#fr_873) One commentator says this means that he should not\nbe supposed to have incurred the demerit of having any attachment to this\nworld. Nilaka _nth_ a says, he gives up everything in the pursuit of even one\nof these observances.\n\n[182:5](sbe0825.htm#fr_874) See [p. 168](sbe0824.htm#page_168).\n\n[182:6](sbe0825.htm#fr_875) I. e. the goal to be reached. The commentary takes\nBrahman to mean the Vedas, and the whole, phrase to mean those who devote\nthemselves to the performance of actions stated in the Vedas.\n\n[183:1](sbe0825.htm#fr_876) One copy of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s commentary says this\nmeans \'obstructing other people\'s acts of piety,\' &c.\n\n[183:2](sbe0825.htm#fr_877) One copy of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s commentary says this\nmeans \'being given up to intoxicating drinks,\' &c.; another copy says, doing\nanother\'s bidding without thought.\'\n\n[183:3](sbe0825.htm#fr_878) One copy says this means \'inattention to any work\nundertaken.,\' another renders the original by \'destruction of property, i.e.\nsquandering it on dancers,\' &c.\n\n[183:4](sbe0825.htm#fr_879) I. e. discrimination between right and wrong.\n\n[183:5](sbe0825.htm#fr_880) This seems to be some error, for censoriousness\'\nhas occurred before. But neither the texts nor the commentaries give any help\nto correct the error. Perhaps the latter is to be distinguished as referring\nto the habit, and the former only to sporadic acts, of censoriousness. These\nqualities, I presume, constitute frenzy; they are not the \'defects.\'\n\n[183:6](sbe0825.htm#fr_881) I. e. where the power to give exists.\n\n[184:1](sbe0825.htm#fr_882) Not a friend\'s.\n\n[184:2](sbe0825.htm#fr_883) For a friend.\n\n[184:3](sbe0825.htm#fr_884) See Gita, [p. 120](sbe0819.htm#page_120).\n\n[184:4](sbe0825.htm#fr_885) The commentators take this to mean objects of\nsense, and they interpret \'elements\' before to mean senses.\n\n[184:5](sbe0825.htm#fr_886) \'Viz. the turning away of the senses from their\nobjects,\' says one copy of _S_ a _n_ kara.\n\n[184:6](sbe0825.htm#fr_887) Scil. to enjoy the higher enjoyments of superior\nworlds.\n\n[184:7](sbe0825.htm#fr_888) I. e. to the higher worlds; it does not lead to\nemancipation here.\n\n[184:8](sbe0825.htm#fr_889) Cf. Mu _nd_ aka, p. 277. I must own that I do not\nquite understand this passage, nor its explanation as given in the\ncommentaries. I do not quite see what the penance here mentioned has to do\nwith sacrifice, and yet the commentators seem to take the words \'since\nsacrifices,\' &c., with what precedes them, not with what follows. Taking\nthem,. however, with what follows, it is difficult to explain the word\n\'since.\' As far as I can understand the passage I take the sense of it to be\nas follows: The author having said that penance performed out of a particular\nmotive does not lead to final emancipation, he then proceeds to point out that\nall \'action\' or \'sacrifice\' is due to an imperfect understanding of the truth\n(cf. [p. 171](sbe0824.htm#page_171) supra), being mostly due to some\nparticular motive. Then he goes on to show the different classes of sacrifice,\nand finally points out that he who is free from desires as superior to one who\nis actuated by desires. The original for \'misapprehension\' is avabodha, which\ncommonly means \'apprehension,\' but _S_ a _n_ kara finally makes it mean moha\nor \'delusion.\' The original for truth is rendered by Nilaka _nth_ a to mean\n\'fancies.\' Nilaka _nth_ a says that the sacrifice by the mind is the highest;\nthat by speech, viz. Brahmaya _g_ \xc3\xb1a, _G_ apa, &c., is middling; and that by\ndeed, viz. with clarified butter and other offerings, of the lowest class.\n\'Perfected by fancies\' = one whose fancies are always fulfilled \'through a\nknowledge,\' says Nilaka _nth_ a, \'of the Brahma as possessing qualities.\'\n\n[185:1](sbe0825.htm#fr_890) This also is far from clear. Should it be, \'and a\nBrahma _n_ a more especially?\' This might be taken as referring to one who\nknows the Brahman as devoid of qualities, as Nilaka _nth_ a does take it. But\nhis construction is not quite clear.\n\n[185:2](sbe0825.htm#fr_891) As serviceable in attaining to \'the glory,\' the\nBrahman; see p. 180.\n\n[185:3](sbe0825.htm#fr_892) See note at p. 181. As to \'arrangements of words,\'\ncf. Maitri, p. 179.\n\n[185:4](sbe0825.htm#fr_893) \'Everything,\' says one copy of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\ncommentary; \'all that is good and desirable,\' says another.\n\n[185:5](sbe0825.htm#fr_894) Cf. inter alia, Mu _nd_ aka, pp. 281-314.\n\n[185:6](sbe0825.htm#fr_895) For he has got to undergo migration from one life\nto another as the result of the action. Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 856; Mu\n_nd_ aka. p. 278.\n\n[185:7](sbe0825.htm#fr_896) Cf.
