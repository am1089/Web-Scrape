Now some lay down (these bricks) so as to be in contact with the\n(gold) man, for he is the vital air, and him these (bricks) sustain; and\nbecause they sustain (bh _ri_ ) the vital air (pra _n_ a), therefore they are\ncalled \'Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ta _h_.\' Let him not do so: the vital air is indeed\nthe same as that gold man, but this body of his extends to as far here as this\nfire (altar) has been marked out. Hence to whatever\n\np. 19\n\nlimb of his these (breath-holders) were not to reach, that limb of his the\nvital air would not reach; and, to be sure, to whatever limb the vital air\ndoes not reach, that either dries up or withers away: let him therefore lay\ndown these (bricks) so as to be in contact with the enclosing stones; and by\nthose which he lays down in the middle this body of his is filled up, and they\nat least are not separated from him.\n\n8:1:4:22\\. Here now they say, \'Whereas in (the formulas) "This one, in front,\nthe existent--this one, on the right, the all-worker--this one, behind, the\nall-embracer--this, on the left, heaven--this one, above, the mind"--they\n(these bricks) are defined as exactly opposite the quarters, why, then, does\nhe lay down these (bricks) in sidelong places 1?\' Well, the Pra _n_ abh _ri_\nta _h_ are the vital airs; and if he were to place them exactly opposite the\nquarters, then this breath would only pass forward and backward; but inasmuch\nas he now lays down these (bricks) thus defined in sidelong places, therefore\nthis breath, whilst being a backward and forward one, passes sideways along\nall the limbs and the whole body.\n\n8:1:4:33\\. Now that Agni (the altar) is an animal, and (as such) he is even\nnow made up whole and entire,--those (bricks) which he lays down in front are\nhis fore-feet, and those behind are his thighs; and those\n\np. 20\n\nwhich he places in the middle are that body of his. He places these in the\nregion of the two reta _h_ si _k_ (bricks), for the reta _h_ si _k_ are the\nribs, and the ribs are the middle, and that body is in the middle (of the\nlimbs). He places them all round, for that body extends all round.\n\n8:1:4:44\\. Here now they say, \'Whereas in the first (four) sets he lays down a\nsingle stoma and a single p _ri_ sh _th_ a each time, why, then, does he lay\ndown here (in the centre) two stomas and two p _ri_ sh _th_ as?\' Well, this\n(central set) is his (Agni\'s) body: he thus makes the body (trunk) the best,\nthe largest, the most vigorous of limbs 1; whence that body is the best, the\nlargest, and most vigorous of limbs.\n\n8:1:4:55\\. Here now they say, \'How does that Agni of his become made up whole\nand entire in brick after brick?\'--Well, the formula is the marrow, the brick\nthe bone, the settling the flesh, the sudadohas the skins, the formula of the\npurisha (fillings of earth) the hair, and the purisha the food: and thus\nindeed that Agni of his becomes made up whole and entire in brick after brick.\n\n8:1:4:66\\. That Agni is possessed of all vital power: verily, whosoever knows\nthat Agni to be possessed of all vital power (ayus), attains his full measure\nof life (ayus).\n\n8:1:4:77\\. Now, then, as to the contraction and expansion (of the body). Now\nsome cause the built (altar) in this way 2 to be possessed of (the power of)\ncontraction and expansion: that Agni indeed is an animal;\n\np. 21\n\nand when an animal contracts and expands its limbs, it develops strength by\nthem.\n\n8:1:4:88\\. [Va _g_. S. XXVII, 45] \'Thou art Sa _m_ vatsara,--thou art\nParivatsara,--thou art Idavatsara,--thou art Idvatsara,--thou art Vatsara,--\nMay thy dawns prosper 1!--may thy days and nights prosper!--may thy half-\nmonths prosper!--may thy months prosper!--may thy seasons prosper!--may thy\nyear prosper!--For going and coming contract and expand thyself!--Of Eagle-\nbuild thou art: by that deity, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, lie thou steady 2!\'\n\n8:1:4:99\\. _S_ a _t_ yayani also once said, \'Some one heard (the sound) 3 of\nthe cracking wings of the (altar)-when touched with this (formula): let him\ntherefore by all means touch it therewith!\'\n\n8:1:4:1010\\. And Svar _g_ it Nagna _g_ ita or Nagna _g_ it, the Gandhara, once\nsaid, \'Contraction and expansion surely are the breath, for in whatever part\nof the body there is breath that it both contracts and expands; let him\nbreathe upon it from outside when completely built: he thereby lays breath,\nthe (power of) contraction and expansion, into it, and so it contracts and\nexpands.\' But indeed what he there said as to that contraction and expansion,\nit was only one of the princely order who said it; and assuredly were they to\nbreathe upon it from outside a hundred\n\np. 22\n\ntimes, or a thousand times, they could not lay breath into it. Whatever breath\nthere is in the (main) body that alone is the breath: hence when he lays down\nthe Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ta _h_ (breath-holders), he thereby lays breath, the\n(power of) contraction and expansion, into it; and so it contracts and\nexpands. He then lays down two Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a (bricks) in that corner\n[1](sbe4307.htm#fn_73): the meaning of them (will be explained) further on\n[2](sbe4307.htm#fn_74). He throws loose earth (on the layer): the meaning of\nthis (will be explained) further on [3](sbe4307.htm#fn_75).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[19:1](sbe4306.htm#fr_68) That is to say, why does he not place them at the\nends of the spines, but at the corners of the (square) body, i.e. in places\nintermediate between the lines running in the direction of the points of the\ncompass? When speaking of the regions, or quarters, it should be borne in mind\nthat they also include a fifth direction, viz. the perpendicular or vertical\nline (both upward and downward) at any given point of the plane.\n\n[20:1](sbe4306.htm#fr_69) Or,--better, larger, and more vigorous than the\nlimbs.\n\n[20:2](sbe4306.htm#fr_70) Viz. by touching, or stroking along, the layer of\nthe altar, and muttering the subsequent formulas.\n\n[21:1](sbe4306.htm#fr_71) Or, perhaps, \'may the dawns chime in (fit in) with\nthee!\'\n\n[21:2](sbe4306.htm#fr_72) For this last part of the formula (\'by that deity,\'\n&c.), the so-called settling-formula, see part iii, p. 307, note 1.\n\n[21:3](sbe4306.htm#fr_73) Harisvamin (Ind. Off. MS. 657) seems to supply \' _s_\nabdam;\' the sound of the cracking being taken as a sign of the powerful effect\nof the formula. Unfortunately, however, the MS. of the commentary is\nhopelessly incorrect.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 2, 1. Second Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe4307.htm)\n\n'
