[2b](ry008.htm#fn_68)  \nThere wisest Brahmans evermore  \n   The flame of worship feed,  \nAnd versed in all the Vedas' lore,  \n   Their lives of virtue lead.  \nTruthful and pure, they freely give;  \n   They keep each sense controlled,  \nAnd in their holy fervour live  \n   Like the great saints of old.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[11:1b](ry007.htm#fr_60) This exploit is related in Canto XI.\n\n[11:2b](ry007.htm#fr_61) The Sarju or Ghaghra, anciently called Sarayu, rises\nin the Himalayas, and after flowing through the province of Oudb, falls into\nthe Gauges.\n\n[12:1](ry007.htm#fr_62) The ruins of the ancient capital of Rama and the\nChildren of the Sun may still be traced in the present Ajudhya near Fyzabad.\nAjudhya is the Jerusalem or Mecca of the Hindus.\n\n[12:2](ry007.htm#fr_63) A legislator and saint, the son of Brahma or a\npersonification of Brahma himself, the creator of the world, and progenitor of\nmankind. Derived from the root _man_ to think, the word means originally _man_\n, the thinker, and is found in this sense in the Rig-veda.\n\nManu as a legislator is identified with the Cretan Minos, as progenitor of\nmankind with the German Mannus: 'Celebrant carminibus antiquis, quod unum apud\nillos memoriae et annalium genus est, Tuisconem deum terra editum, et fllium\nMannum, originem gentis conditoresque.' TACITUS, _Germania_ , Cap. II.\n\n[12:3](ry007.htm#fr_64) The Sal (Shorea Robusta) is a valuable timber tree of\nconsiderable height.\n\n[12:4](ry007.htm#fr_65) The city of Indra is called Amaravati or Home of the\nImmortals.\n\n[12:5](ry007.htm#fr_66) Schlegel thinks that this refers to the marble of\ndifferent colours with which the houses were adorned. It seems more natural to\nunderstand it as implying the regularity of the streets and houses.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto VI.: The King.](ry008.htm)\n\n"
