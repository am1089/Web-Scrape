What he\nmeans is evidently that he forgot or neglected her till she was seventeen\nyears of age. But this can hardly be called barbarous in India, where it is a\nrecognised custom that a girl of five years of age, as his wife was when he\nmarried her, should remain at her parents' house for years before she migrated\nto the house of her husband and his parents. And that a man in a state such as\nRamak _ri_ sh _n_ a is described to have been in should decline to live\n_maritalement_ , is again by no means unusual in Eastern, nay, in Western\ncountries also.\n\nVivekananda told us that when at the age of seventeen his wife went to find\nhim, he received her with real kindness, and that she was quite satisfied to\nlive with him on his own terms, if he would only enlighten her mind and make\nher to see and to serve God. Such a relationship is by no means without a\nprecedent, and cannot be called barbarous, for _volenti non fit injuria_.\nStrange to say, I received not many days ago a letter from an American lady\nwho had gone to visit Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a's widow, Mrs. S. C. Ole Bull, the\nwidow of the famous violin player, and deeply interested in the religious\nmovements in India. On July 11, 1898, she writes from _S_ rinagar in Kashmir:\n'We were the first foreigners who were allowed to see Sarada-devi, the widow\nof Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a. She called us her children, and saying that our visit\nto her was of the\n\np. 65\n\n[paragraph continues] Lord, she felt no strangeness in being with us. When\nasked to define the obedience to a Guru, who in her case was her husband, she\nreplied to the effect that when one had chosen a Guru or teacher, one should\nlisten to and obey all his directions for spiritual advancement, but in things\ntemporal one could most truly serve a Guru by using one's own best\ndiscernment, even if at times it were not in agreement with suggestions given.\n\n'When she gladly gave her husband, to whom she had been united by child-\nmarriage, her assent that he should lead a Sa _m_ nyasin's life, she gained\nhis intimate friendship, and became his disciple, receiving daily instruction.\nDuring the years of her life with him she was his adviser, praying earnestly\nfor such purity of motive that she might never fail him. She had also taken\nthe vow of poverty and chastity, and in renouncing the natural joys of a\nmother, she became with him the spiritual parent of many children.'\n\nIt is strange that a man of Mozoomdar's knowledge and experience should have\nconsidered the resolve of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a's wife to live with him as a Sa\n_m_ nyasini as barbarous treatment. She herself evidently did not think so,\nnor have I heard of any other cruelties on the part of her husband. If she was\nsatisfied with her life, who has any right to complain; and is love between\nhusband and wife really impossible without the procreation of children? We\nmust learn to believe in Hindu honesty, however incredulous we might justly be\non such matters in our own country. Anyhow, I know of no one else who has\ntaken offence at Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a's spiritual marriage.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a's Influence on Keshub Chunder Sen](rls19.htm)\n\n"
