It will be difficult to disprove her,\nfor though witnesses of a real event may be few or even wanting, innumerable\nproofs of a thing that has not happened can always be marshalled. The object\nof this move is, evidently, to get the sale of Panchu\'s holding to me set\naside. Being unable to find any other way out of it, I was thinking of\nallowing Panchu to hold a permanent tenure in my estates and building him a\ncottage on it. But my master would not have it. I should not give in to these\nnefarious tactics so easily, he objected, and offered to attend to the matter\nhimself.\n\n"You, sir!" I cried, considerably surprised.\n\n"Yes, I," he repeated.\n\nI could not see, at all clearly, what my master could do to counteract these\nlegal machinations. That evening, at the time he usually came to me, he did\nnot turn up. On my making inquiries, his servant said he had left home with a\nfew things packed in a small trunk, and some bedding, saying he would be back\nin a few days. I thought he might have sallied forth to hunt for witnesses in\nPanchu\'s uncle\'s village. In that case, however, I was. sure that his would be\na hopeless quest ...\n\nDuring the day I forget myself in my work. As the late autumn afternoon wears\non, the colours of the sky become turbid, and so do the feelings of my mind.\nThere are many in this world whose minds dwell in brick-built houses--they can\nafford to ignore the thing called the outside. But my mind lives under the\ntrees in the open, directly receives upon itself the messages borne by the\nfree winds, and responds from the bottom of its heart to all the musical\ncadences of light and darkness.\n\nWhile the day is bright and the world in the pursuit of its numberless tasks\ncrowds around, then it seems as if my life wants nothing else. But when the\ncolours of the sky fade away and the blinds are drawn down over the windows of\nheaven, then my heart tells me that evening falls just for the purpose of\nshutting out the world, to mark the time when the darkness must be filled with\nthe One. This is the end to which earth, sky, and waters conspire, and I\ncannot harden myself against accepting its meaning. So when the gloaming\ndeepens over the world, like the gaze of the dark eyes of the beloved, then my\nwhole being tells me that work alone cannot be the truth of life, that work is\nnot the be-all and the end-all of man, for man is not simply a serf-- even\nthough the serfdom be of the True and the Good.\n\nAlas, Nikhil, have you for ever parted company with that self of yours who\nused to be set free under the starlight, to plunge into the infinite depths of\nthe night\'s darkness after the day\'s work was done? How terribly alone is he,\nwho misses companionship in the midst of the multitudinousness of life.\n\nThe other day, when the afternoon had reached the meeting-point of day and\nnight, I had no work, nor the mind for work, nor was my master there to keep\nme company. With my empty, drifting heart longing to anchor on to something, I\ntraced my steps towards the inner gardens. I was very fond of chrysanthemums\nand had rows of them, of all varieties, banked up in pots against one of the\ngarden walls. When they were in flower, it looked like a wave of green\nbreaking into iridescent foam. It was some time since I had been to this part\nof the grounds, and I was beguiled into a cheerful expectancy at the thought\nof meeting my chrysanthemums after our long separation.\n\nAs I went in, the full moon had just peeped over the wall, her slanting rays\nleaving its foot in deep shadow. It seemed as if she had come a-tiptoe from\nbehind, and clasped the darkness over the eyes, smiling mischievously. When I\ncame near the bank of chrysanthemums, I saw a figure stretched on the grass in\nfront. My heart gave a sudden thud. The figure also sat up with a start at my\nfootsteps.\n\nWhat was to be done next? I was wondering whether it would do to beat a\nprecipitate retreat. Bimala, also, was doubtless casting about for some way of\nescape. But it was as awkward to go as to stay! Before I could make up my\nmind, Bimala rose, pulled the end of her _sari_ over her head, and walked off\ntowards the inner apartments.\n\nThis brief pause had been enough to make real to me the cruel load of Bimala\'s\nmisery. The plaint of my own life vanished from me in a moment. I called out:\n"Bimala!"\n\nShe started and stayed her steps, but did not turn back. I went round and\nstood before her. Her face was in the shade, the moonlight fell on mine. Her\neyes were downcast, her hands clenched.\n\n"Bimala," said I, "why should I seek to keep you fast in this closed cage of\nmine? Do I not know that thus you cannot but pine and droop?"\n\nShe stood still, without raising her eyes or uttering a word.\n\n"I know," I continued, "that if I insist on keeping you shackled my whole life\nwill be reduced to nothing but an iron chain. What pleasure can that be to\nme?"\n\nShe was still silent.\n\n"So," I concluded, "I tell you, truly, Bimala, you are free. Whatever I may or\nmay not have been to you, I refuse to be your fetters." With which I came away\ntowards the outer apartments.\n\nNo, no, it was not a generous impulse, nor indifference. I had simply come to\nunderstand that never would I be free until I could set free. To try to keep\nBimala as a garland round my neck, would have meant keeping a weight hanging\nover my heart. Have I not been praying with all my strength, that if happiness\nmay not be mine, let it go; if grief needs must be my lot, let it come; but\nlet me not be kept in bondage. To clutch hold of that which is untrue as\nthough it were true, is only to throttle oneself. May I be saved from such\nself-destruction.\n\nWhen I entered my room, I found my master waiting there. My agitated feelings\nwere still heaving within me. "Freedom, sir," I began unceremoniously, without\ngreeting or inquiry, "freedom is the biggest thing for man. Nothing can be\ncompared to it-- nothing at all!"\n\nSurprised at my outburst, my master looked up at me in silence.\n\n"One can understand nothing from books," I went on. "We read in the scriptures\nthat our desires are bonds, fettering us as well as others. But such words, by\nthemselves, are so empty. It is only when we get to the point of letting the\nbird out of its cage that we can realize how free the bird has set us.\nWhatever we cage, shackles us with desire whose bonds are stronger than those\nof iron chains. I tell you, sir, this is just what the world has failed to\nunderstand. They all seek to reform something outside themselves. But reform\nis wanted only in one\'s own desires, nowhere else, nowhere else!"\n\n"We think," he said, "that we are our own masters when we get in our hands the\nobject of our desire--but we are really our own masters only when we are able\nto cast out our desires from our minds."\n\n"When we put all this into words, sir," I went on, "it sounds like some bald-\nheaded injunction, but when we realize even a little of it we find it to be\n_amrita_ \\--which the gods have drunk and become immortal. We cannot see\nBeauty till we let go our hold of it. It was Buddha who conquered the world,\nnot Alexander--this is untrue when stated in dry prose--oh when shall we be\nable to sing it? When shall all these most intimate truths of the universe\noverflow the pages of printed books and leap out in a sacred stream like the\nGanges from the Gangotrie?"\n\nI was suddenly reminded of my master\'s absence during the last few days and of\nmy ignorance as to its reason. I felt somewhat foolish as I asked him: "And\nwhere have you been all this while, sir?"\n\n"Staying with Panchu," he replied.\n\n"Indeed!" I exclaimed. "Have you been there all these days?"\n\n"Yes. I wanted to come to an understanding with the woman who calls herself\nhis aunt. She could hardly be induced to believe that there could be such an\nodd character among the gentlefolk as the one who sought their hospitality.\nWhen she found I really meant to stay on, she began to feel rather ashamed of\nherself. \'Mother,\' said I, \'you are not going to get rid of me, even if you\nabuse me! And so long as I stay, Panchu stays also. For you see, do you not,\nthat I cannot stand by and see his motherless little ones sent out into the\nstreets?\'\n\n"She listened to my talks in this strain for a couple of days without saying\nyes or no. This morning I found her tying up her bundles. \'We are going back\nto Brindaban,\' she said. \'Let us have our expenses for the journey.\' I knew\nshe was not going to Brindaban, and also that the cost of her journey would be\nsubstantial. So I have come to you."\n\n"The required cost shall be paid," I said.\n\n"The old woman is not a bad sort," my master went on musingly. "Panchu was not\nsure of her caste, and would not let her touch the water-jar, or anything at\nall of his. So they were continually bickering. When she found I had no\nobjection to her touch, she looked after me devotedly. She is a splendid cook!\n\n"But all remnants of Panchu\'s respect for me vanished! To the last he had\nthought that I was at least a simple sort of person. But here was I, risking\nmy caste without a qualm to win over the old woman for my purpose. Had I tried\nto steal a march on her by tutoring a witness for the trial, that would have\nbeen a different matter. Tactics must be met by tactics. But stratagem at the\nexpense of orthodoxy is more than he can tolerate!\n\n"Anyhow, I must stay on a few days at Panchu\'s even after the woman leaves,\nfor Harish Kundu may be up to any kind of devilry. He has been telling his\nsatellites that he was content to have furnished Panchu with an aunt, but I\nhave gone the length of supplying him with a father. He would like to see,\nnow, how many fathers of his can save him!"\n\n"We may or may not be able to save him," I said; "but if we should perish in\nthe attempt to save the country from the thousand-and-one snares--of religion,\ncustom and selfishness-- which these people are busy spreading, we shall at\nleast die happy."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIV](hw34.htm)\n\n'
