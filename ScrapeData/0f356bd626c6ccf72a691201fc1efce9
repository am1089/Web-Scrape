One of\nthe most ancient commands of Greek philosophy was the famous \xce\x93\xce\xbd\xe1\xbf\xb6\xce\xb8\xce\xb9 \xcf\x83\xce\xb5\xce\xb1\xcf\x85\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd,\nknow thyself. Here the Hindu philosopher would step in at once and say that\n\np. 81\n\nthis is likewise the very highest object of their own philosophy, only that\nthey express it more fully by \xc3\x82tmanam atmana pa _s_ ya, See the Self by the\nSelf! But like true philosophers they would let no word pass unchallenged, and\nwould ask at once, who or what is meant by the \xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, or by the Self? The\nVedanta-philosophy has been called a philosophy of negation, which tries to\narrive at the truth by a repeated denial of what cannot be the truth. It often\ndefines its own character by Na, na, Not this, not that. First of all then the\nVedanta would say, the \xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, or that which is what we are, the Self; cannot\nbe the body. In the true sense of the word, the body is not, has no right to\nbe called being, sat, because sooner or later it ceases to be, and nothing can\never cease to be, if it really is. As the body is not eternal, it is not real\nin the highest sense of reality. If therefore we want to know what is truly\nreal, the body (deha or sthula _s_ arira) cannot be the \xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82 or the Self.\n\nBut if we see that all we know comes to us through the five senses of seeing,\nhearing, touching, tasting, and smelling, that we cannot go beyond the senses,\nthat we never have nor can have more than sensuous images of the world and of\nourselves, and that what we call our knowledge consists in the first instance\nof these images, not of any realities, which we may postulate, indeed, as\nunderlying these images, but which we can never reach, except by hypothesis,\nmight we not say that our senses as a whole are our \xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82 or Self? The\nVedantist would reply again, No, no. Our senses are wonderful indeed, but they\nare only the instruments of our knowledge, they\n\np. 82\n\nform part of our body, they perish with the body, and cannot therefore\nconstitute our real Self. Besides the five senses which the Hindus call _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ anendriyas, senses of knowledge, they admit five other senses which they\ncall karmendriyas, senses of action, namely, the senses of speaking, grasping,\nmoving, excretion, and procreation. This is an idea peculiar to the Hindus,\nthe former five being intended for action from without to within (upalabdhi),\nthe latter for action from within to without (karman). The images brought to\nus by the senses, on which we depend for all our knowledge, are what we should\ncall states of consciousness, they are not even our Ego, much less our Self.\nThey come and go, arise and vanish, and cannot therefore be called real or\neternal, as little as the body. In all these images we may distinguish the\nsubject or the active element, and the object or the passive element. The\npassive or objective elements are what we are accustomed to call matter, and\nthis matter, according to the five senses by which it is perceived, is divided\ninto five kinds, viz. ether, corresponding to hearing; light, corresponding to\nseeing; air, corresponding to touching; water, corresponding to tasting; and\nearth, corresponding to smelling. This is all that we can legitimately mean by\nthe five elements. They are to us states of consciousness, or vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana\nonly. But though to us elementary matter exists, and can exist as known, or in\nthe form of knowledge only, the Vedanta does not deny its existence, whatever\nit may say about its reality. If the objects of our sensuous knowledge are all\nthe result of Avidya, the elements also\n\np. 83\n\nmust share that fate, and cannot claim more than a phenomenal reality.\n\nAs, however, there are few, if any, sensations corresponding to one element\nonly, without being mixed up with others, each element is supposed to be five-\nfolded, that is, to contain one preponderating quality, and small portions of\nthe others. This so-called Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ikara _n_ a or quintupling is not to be\nfound, however, in the ancient Vedanta; it belongs to the refinements, and not\nalways improvements, of a later age to which we owe such works as the very\npopular Vedantasara. A different and, as it would seem, far more primitive\nconception of the elements is found in the Upanishads, for instance, the _Kh_\nandogya Upanishad VI, 2. We generally find in India four elements, or, with\nthe addition of aka _s_ a, ether, as the vehicle of sound, five. The most\nprimitive conception of the constituent elements of the world, however, would\nseem to have been three; namely, what is earthy, what is fiery, and what is\nwatery. These three elements could not possibly be overlooked, and this\nthreefold division is actually found in the _Kh_ andogya, where the three\nelements are called Anna, Te _g_ as, and Ap, or, as they are arranged there,\nfirst, Te _g_ as, including fire, light, and warmth, then Ap, water, and\nlastly Anna, earth. It is true that Anna means otherwise food, but it can here\nbe taken in the sense of earth only, as sup-plying food. The first is\nrepresented as red, the second as white, the third as black. These three\nelements also are represented as being mixed in three proportions, and as\nconstituent elements of the human body they are\n\np. 84\n\nrepresented as passing through three forms of development, the earthy portion\nbeing manifested in faeces, flesh, and Manas, the watery portion in urine,\nblood, and life, the fiery portion in bones, marrow, and speech. There are\nmany of these purely fanciful speculations to be found in the Upanishads.\nThis, however, should not be allowed to prejudice us against what is simple\nand primitive and rational in these depositories of ancient thought. But if it\nis asked, Can these passive and active senses be the Self? the Vedantist says\nagain, No, no; they are not what we are in search of, they cannot be the\n\xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, which must be real, unchanging, and eternal.\n\nIf this applies to the ten senses, it applies with equal strength to what is\nsometimes called the eleventh sense, the Manas, all treated as material, and\nas products of the earthy element. Manas is etymologically closely connected\nwith _mens_ and has therefore been generally translated by _mind_. But though\nit may be used in that sense in ordinary language, it has a narrower meaning\nin Sanskrit philosophy. It is meant for the central and combining organ of the\nsenses of perception and action. This Manas performs originally, what we\nascribe to the faculty of attention (avadhana): it acts, as we are told, as a\ndoorkeeper, pre-venting the impressions of the different senses from rushing\nin simultaneously, and producing nothing but confusion. It is easy to show\nthat this central sense also falls under the Vedantic No, no. It cannot be the\nSelf, which must be permanent and real; it is an instrument only, and\ntherefore called anta _h_ kara _n_ a--the inner organ. We see here the\n\np. 85\n\nsame confusion which exists elsewhere. There is such an abundance of words\nexpressive of what is going on within us, our anta _h_ kara _n_ a, our mind in\nits various manifestations, that we are embarrassed rather than helped by this\nwealth. The worst of it is that as there are so many words, it was supposed at\na later time that each must have its own peculiar meaning; and, if it had not,\nscholastic definition soon came in to assign to each that special meaning\nwhich it was to have in future. In the meantime the stream of languages flowed\non in complete disregard of such artificial barriers, and with every new\nphilosophy the confusion became greater and greater. It is easy to understand\nthat if each language by itself can seldom give us well-defined terms for the\nvarious manifestations of our perceptive and reasoning powers, the confusion\nbecomes still greater when we attempt to render the psychological terms of one\nby those of another language. For instance, if we translated \xc3\x82tman, as is\nmostly done, by soul, we should be rendering what is free from all passions by\na word which generally implies the seat of the passions. And if we were to\nfollow the example of others and translate Manas by understanding or\n_Verstand_ , we should render what is meant as chiefly a perceptive and\narranging faculty by a name that implies reasoning from the lowest to the\nhighest form. With us _Verstand_ is what distinguishes men from animals, while\nin the Vedanta, Manas is not denied to animals, not even, as it would seem, to\nplants 1.\n\nIt seems better therefore to retain as much as possible\n\np. 86\n\nthe technical terms of Sanskrit philosophy, and to speak of \xc3\x82tman or the Self\ninstead of soul, of Manas, or possibly mind, instead of understanding or\n_Verstand_.\n\nWe shall see that even in Sanskrit itself the confusion is very great, there\nbeing more terms than can be accommodated or be kept distinct one from the\nother. By the side of the Indriyas, or senses, for instance, we also find Pra\n_n_ as, literally vital spirits, which include the Manas, and as a _conditio\nsine qua non_ , but not as one of the Indriyas, the so-called Mukhya Pra _n_\na, the vital breath, that passes from the lungs through the mouth, and which\nagain in a very artificial, if not to say foolish, manner is divided into five\nvarieties. The Manas is then treated, like the senses, as part of the body,\nbeing meant at first, I believe, for no more than the central and\nsuperintending perceptive organ But it has many functions, and the names of\nsome of them are interchanged with the names of the Manas itself. We have\nBuddhi, the general name for perception and mental activity, _K_ itta, thought\nor what is thought, Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana, discrimination, some of which are\nsometimes treated as separate faculties. Sa _m_ kara, however, shows his\npowerful grasp by comprising all under Manas, so that Manas is sometimes\nreason, sometimes understanding, or mind or thought. This simplifies his\npsychology very much, though it may lead to misunderstandings also. Manas\ngives us the images (Vorstellungen) which consist of the contributions of the\ndifferent senses; it tells us this is this (nis _k_ aya) and fixes it\n(adhyavasaya). Images are formed into concepts and words (sa _m_ kalpa); these\nmay be called into question sa _m_ saya),\n\np. 87\n\nand weighed (vikalpa) against each other, so as to give us judgements. Here\nthen we should have in a rough form the elements of our psychology, but it\nmust be confessed that they were never minutely elaborated by the Vedanta\nphilosophers. Even the meanings here assigned to the different psychological\nterms, were so assigned etymologically rather than from definitions given by\nSa _m_ kara himself. According to him, Manas gives us everything; impressions,\nimages, concepts, and judgements, nay even self-consciousness or Aha _m_ kara,\ni.e. the Ego-making, and consequently the distinguishing between subjects and\nobjects, all are Manas. But when we ask, is the Manas, or the Aha _m_ kara, or\nBuddhi, or _K_ itta, are any of the attributes of Manas, such as Kama, desire,\nDhi, fear, Hri, shame, Dhi, wisdom, Vi _k_ ikitsa, doubt, _S_ raddha, belief,\nA _s_ raddha, unbelief, Dh _ri_ ti, decision, Adh _ri_ ti, wavering,--are all\nor any of these the true Self? the Vedantist answers again, No, no; they are\ntemporal, they are composite, they come and they go, they cannot be what we\nare in search of, the true and eternal Self. It is clear that when we say my\nbody, there are two things presupposed, one thing the body, the other he to\nwhom it belongs. So again when we speak of my senses, my mind, nay of my Ego,\nwe distinguish between a possessor and what for the time being he possesses.\nBut we should never say my Self, because that is tautological: the Self cannot\nbelong to any one else. If we were to say my Self, we could only mean our Ego,\nbut if we say our Self, i.e. the Self of all, or simply Self, we mean Brahman,\nBrahman as hidden within us and\n\np. 88\n\nwithin the world. At the time of death the organs of knowledge are not\nsupposed to be destroyed absolutely, but while there is another life before\nus, they are reduced to a seminal or potential form only, and though the\noutward organs themselves will decay, their potentia or powers remain,\ndwelling in what is called the Sukshma- _S_ arira, the subtile body, the body\nthat migrates from birth to birth and becomes again and again a Sthula- _S_\narira, a material body. But when real freedom has once been obtained, this\nSukshma- _S_ arira also vanishes and there remains the \xc3\x82tman only, or Brahman\nas he was and always will be. The form assumed by the body in every new\nexistence is determined by the deeds and thoughts during former existences: it\nis still, so to say, under the law of causality.\n\nThen what remains for the surds, for the \xc3\x82tman? The Greek sages have hardly\nany answer to give; to them the \xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82 was seldom more than the Ego, Aha _m_\nkara, while with the Vedantist it is distinctly not the Ego as opposed to a\nNon-Ego, but something beyond, something not touched by the law of causality,\nsomething neither suffering, nor enjoying, nor acting, but that without which\nneither the gross nor the subtile body could ever exist. This Self, this the\ntrue \xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, was discovered in the lotus of the heart in true Self-\nconsciousness, it was discovered as not-personal; though dwelling in the\npersonal or living \xc3\x82tman, the _G_ iva, it remained for ever a mere looker-on,\nuntouched by anything. As I said before, the Vedanta-philosophy is a\nphilosophy of negation; it says No, no, it says all that the Self is not, but\nwhat the Self is, defies all words and all thoughts.\n\np. 89\n\n[paragraph continues] Our thoughts and our words return from it baffled, as\nthe Veda says. There are passages in the Upanishads where attempts are made to\nbring us nearer to a conception of the Self, whether we call it the Brahman or\nthe \xc3\x82tman, but these attempts never go so far as a definition of these two, or\nof this One Power. In the _Kh_ andogya Upanishad III, 14, we read: 'Surely\nthis universe is Brahman. It should be worshipped in silence as the beginning,\nthe being, and the end of all. Its matter is thought, life its body, light its\nform. Its will is truth, its Self the infinite (ether). It works all, it wills\nall, it scents all, it tastes all, embracing the Universe, silent and\nunconcerned. This is the Self in the innermost heart, smaller than a mustard-\nseed or the kernel of it. This is the Self in the innermost heart, larger than\nthe earth, larger than the atmosphere, larger than the sky, larger than all\nworlds. The all-working, all-willing, all-scenting, all-tasting one, the all-\nembracing, silent, unconcerned one, this is the Self in the innermost heart,\nthis is Brahman, this I shall become when parting from hence. He who has this,\ndoes not doubt.'\n\nThis subject is treated again and again. Very much as we saw it treated in the\n_Kh_ andogya, we find it treated in the Taittiriya Upanishad II, 1-7. One\ncovering after another is there removed, till there remains in the end the\npure Self. First the body of flesh and blood is re-moved, then the vital\nbreath, then the Manas, and with it thought, till at last nothing remains but\nthe Self full of bliss. This is called the sap or the essence. It is this Self\n\np. 90\n\nthat brings bliss, finding peace and rest in the invisible, the immaterial,\nthe inexpressible, the unfathomable. So long as anything else is left, hidden\nanywhere, there is no peace and no rest, however wise a man may think himself.\nOr, as Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya says: 'He who knows this, knows everything.' Every\nname that can be imagined for expressing what is really inexpressible, is\nassigned in the Upanishads to Brahman. Brahman is neither long nor short,\nneither subtile nor gross; he is without parts, without activity, still,\nwithout spot, without fraud, he is unborn, never growing old, not fading nor\ndying, nor fearing anything; he is without and within.' Whether such a being\ncan be called he, is very doubtful, for he is neither he nor she; he is It in\nthe very highest sense of that undifferentiated pronoun.\n\nWe thus see that both methods, the first that started from the postulate that\nthe true Self must be one, without a second, and the second, which holds that\nthe true Self must be unchanging, eternal, without beginning or end, arrive at\nthe same final result, viz. that the Self of the world can be nothing that is\nperceived in this changing world, and that our own Self too can be nothing\nthat is perceived as changing, as being born, as living and dying. Both may,\nin one sense of the word, be called nothings; though they are in reality that\nin comparison with which everything else is nothing. If the world is real the\nSelf is not, if the Self is real the world is not.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[80:2](rls22.htm#fr_11) Cf.
