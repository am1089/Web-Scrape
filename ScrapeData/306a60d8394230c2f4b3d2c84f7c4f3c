O my love!' he cries.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[414:1b](ry375.htm#fr_864) Sita of course knows nothing of what has happened\nto Rama since the time when she was carried away by Ravan, The poet therefore\nthinks it necessary to repeat the whole story of the meeting between Rama and\nSugriva, the defeat of Bali, and subsequent events.
