In this life also (the origination of knowledge takes place) if there is\nno obstruction of what is ready at hand; on account of this being seen (in\nscripture).\n\nBeginning from Sutra 26 of the present pada we have discussed the various\nmeans of knowledge. We are now to consider whether knowledge--the fruit of\nthose means--when accomplishing itself accomplishes itself only here in this\nlife, or sometimes in the next life only,--The purvapakshin maintains that it\naccomplishes itself here in this life only. For, he argues, knowledge has for\nits antecedent the learning of scripture and so on, and nobody applies himself\nto learning, &c., with the intention that knowledge should result therefrom in\nthe next life only; we rather observe that men begin to learn with a view to\nknowledge already springing up in this life. And also sacrifices and the like\nproduce knowledge only mediately through learning and so on; for knowledge can\nbe produced (directly) through the means of right knowledge only 1. Hence the\norigination of knowledge takes place in this life only.--To this we reply,\n'The origination of knowledge takes place in this life if there is no\nobstruction of that which is ready at hand.' That means: When the means of\nknowledge which is operative is not obstructed by some other work the results\nof which are just then reaching maturity, knowledge already reaches maturity\nin this life.\n\np. 328\n\n[paragraph continues] But when such an obstruction takes place, then in the\nnext life. And a work's reaching maturity depends on place, time, and\noperative cause presenting themselves. Nor is there any binding rule according\nto which the same time, place, and operative cause which ripen one work should\nripen another work also; for there are works the fruits of which are opposed\nto each other. And scripture also goes only so far as to teach what the fruit\nof each work is,, without teaching the special conditions of place time, and\noperative cause. And owing to the specific strength of the means employed the\nsupersensuous power of one, work manifests itself (i.e. the fruit of that work\nrealizes itself), while that of another is obstructed thereby and comes to a\nstandstill.\n\nNor is there any reason why a man should not form, with regard to knowledge,\nan unspecified intention 1; for we may freely form the intention that\nknowledge should spring up from us cither in this life or in some subsequent\nlife. And knowledge although springing up through the mediation of learning\nand so on, springs up only in so far as learning destroys the obstacles in the\nway of knowledge. Thus scripture also declares the difficulty of knowing the\nSell, 'He of whom many are not even able to hear, whom many even when they\nhear of him do not comprehend; wonderful is a man when found who is able to\nteach him; wonderful is he who comprehends him when taught by an able teacher'\n(Ka. Up. I, 2, 7).--Moreover scripture relates that Vamadeva already became\nBrahman in his mother's womb, and thus shows that knowledge may spring up in a\nlater form of existence through means procured in a former one; for a child in\nthe womb cannot possibly procure such means in its present state.\n\nThe same is shown by Sm _ri_ ti. Vasudeva being asked by Ar _g_ una, 'What\nwill be the fate of him, O Krishna, who has not reached perfection?' replies,\n'None who performs good works undergoes an evil fate;' declares thereupon\n\np. 329\n\nthat such a man reaches the world of the blessed and is, later on, born again\nin a good family; and finally states just what we at present maintain in the\npassage beginning, 'There he obtains that knowledge which corresponds to his\nformer bodily existence,' and closing, 'Perfected by many states of existence\nhe then goes the highest way.'--It therefore is an established conclusion that\nknowledge originates, either in the present or in a future life, in dependence\non the evanescence of obstacles.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[327:1](sbe38260.htm#fr_205) Of which study is one.--Sacrifices indeed may\nbear their special fruits in the next life only; but in so far as they co-\noperate towards knowledge they are effective in this life. For their only\naction in that line is to purify the mind and thus to render it fitter to\nreceive knowledge.\n\n[328:1](sbe38260.htm#fr_206) I.e. there is no reason for the assertion made by\nthe purvapakshin that men form a specified intention only, viz. that knowledge\nshould spring up in this life only.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 52](sbe38261.htm)\n\n"
