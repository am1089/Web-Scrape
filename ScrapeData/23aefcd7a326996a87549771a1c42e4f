Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! Now I am speaking of the auspicious\nmidday Sandhya, the practice of which leads to the wonderfully excellent\nresults. Listen. Here the \xc3\x82chamana and other things are similar to those of\nthe morning Sandhya. Only in meditation (Dhyanam) there is some difference. I\nwill now speak of that. The name of the midday Gayatri is Savitri. She is ever\na youthful maiden, of white colour, three-eyed; She holds in Her one hand a\nrosary, in Her other hand a trident and with Her two other hands She makes\nsigns to Her Bhaktas to dispel fear and to grant boons. Riding on the bull,\nShe recites the Yayur Vedas; She is the Rudra S\xc2\x92akti with Tamo gu _n_ as and\nShe resides in Brahmaloka, She daily traverses in the path of the Sun. She is\nMaya Devi, beginningless; I bow down to Her. After meditating on the \xc3\x82dya Devi\nBhagavati perform \xc3\x82chamanas and other things as in the morning Sandhya. Now,\nabout the offering of Arghya (an offer of green grass, rice, etc., made in\nworshipping a God or Brahma _n_ ). Collect flowers for Arghya; in the absence\nof flowers, the Bael leaves and water will serve the purpose. Facing the Sun,\nand looking upwards, offer the Arghya to the Sun upwards. Then perform other\nacts as in the morning Sandhya. In midday, some offer Arghya to the Sun, only\nwith the recitation of the Gayatri mantra. But that is not approved of by the\ntradition and community; there is the likelihood of the whole work being\nthwarted or rendered fruitless. For, in the morning and evening Sandhyas, the\nRak _s_ ashas named the Mandehas become\n\nready to devour the Sun. This is stated in the S\xc2\x92rutis. Therefore the midday\noffering of the Arghya is not for the destruction of the Daityas but for the\nsatisfaction of the Devi; so with the mantra \xc2\x93\xc3\x82kri _sn_ ena, etc.,\xc2\x94 the\noffering of Arghya can be effected; and the reciting of the infallible Gayatri\nmantra is only to create disturbance in the shape of thwarting the action. So\nin the morning and evening, the Brahma _n_ a is to offer the Suryarghya,\nrepeating the Gayatri and Pra _n_ ava; and in the midday to offer flowers and\nwater with the mantra \xc2\x93\xc3\x82kri _sn_ ena, rajasa etc.,\xc2\x94 else it will go against\nthe S\xc2\x92ruti. In the absence of flowers, the Durba grass, etc., can be offered\ncarefully as the Arghya; and the full fruits of the Sandhya\n\n\n\np. 1115\n\n\n\nwill be secured. O Best of Devar _s_ is! Now hear the important points in the\nTarpa _n_ am (peace offerings). Thus :--\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93Om Bhuva _h_ puru _s_ am tarpayami namo nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Yajurvedam tarpayami namo nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Ma _nd_ alam tarpayami namo nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Hira _n_ yagarbham tarpayami namo nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om antaratmanam tarpayami namo nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Savitrim tarpayami namo nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Devamataram tarpayami namo nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Samkritim tarpayami namo nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Yuvatim sandhyam tarpayami namo nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Rudra _n_ im tarpayami namo nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Nimrijam tarpayami namo nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Bhurbhuva _h_ Sva _h_ puru _s_ am tarpayami namo nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus finish the midday Sandhya mga Tarpa _n_ am. Now, with your hands raised\nhigh up towards the Sun, worship Him by the two mantras, praising thus :--\n\xc2\x93Om Udutyam Jatavedasam, etc.,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Om Chitram Devanam, etc.\xc2\x94 Next repeat the\nGayatri. Hear its method. In the morning, repeat the Gayatri at the proper\nmoment with hands raised; in the evening time with hands lowered and in the\nmidday with hands over the breast. Begin with the middle phalanx (joint) of\nthe nameless finger, then the phalanx at its root, then the phalanx at the\nroot of the little finger, its middle phalanx and its top, then the tops of\nthe nameless, fore and ring fingers, then the middle and finally the root of\nthe ring finger (in the direction of the hands of the watch; avoiding the\nmiddle and root phalanx of the middle finger). Thus ten times it is repeated.\nIn this way if the Gayatri be repeated one thousand times, the sins arising\nfrom killing a cow, father, mother, from causing abortions, going to the wife\nof one\xc2\x92s Guru, stealing a Brahma _n_ a\xc2\x92s property, a Brahma _n_ \xc2\x92s field,\ndrinking wine, etc., all are destroyed. Also the sins acquired in three births\nby mind, word, or by the enjoyments of sensual objects are thereby then and\nthere instantly destroyed. All the labours of him, who works hard in the study\nof the Vedas without knowing the Gayatri, are useless. Therefore if you\ncompare on the one hand the study of the four Vedas with the reciting of the\nGayatri, then the Gayatri Japam stands higher. Thus I have spoken to you of\nthe rules of the midday Sandhya. Now I am speaking of Brahma Yaj\xc3\xb1a. Hear.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Nineteenth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the midday Sandhya in\nthe Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 20](bk11ch20.htm)\n\n'
