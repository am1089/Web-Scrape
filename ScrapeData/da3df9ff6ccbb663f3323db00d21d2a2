Was it water really? Was it water? Yes, all this was water indeed. This\n(water) was the root (cause), that (the world) was the shoot (effect). He (the\nperson) is the father, they (earth, fire, &c.) are the sons. Whatever there is\nbelonging to the son, belongs to the father; whatever there is belonging to\nthe father, belongs to the son. This was intended 2.\n\n2\\. Mahidasa Aitareya, who knew this, said: 'I know myself (reaching) as far\nas the gods, and I know the gods (reaching) as far as me. For these\n\np. 213\n\ngods receive their gifts from hence, and are supported from hence.'\n\n3\\. This is the mountain 1, viz. eye, ear, mind, speech, and breath. They call\nit the mountain of Brahman.\n\n4\\. He who knows this, throws down the evil enemy who hates him; the evil\nenemy who hates him is defeated.\n\n5\\. He (the Pra _n_ a, identified with Brahman) is the life, the breath; he is\nbeing (while the _g_ ivatman remains), and not-being (when the _g_ ivatman\ndeparts).\n\n6\\. The Devas (speech, &c.) worshipped him (pra _n_ a) as Bhuti or being, and\nthus they became great beings. And therefore even now a man who sleeps,\nbreathes like bhurbhu _h_.\n\n7\\. The Asuras worshipped him as Abhuti or not being, and thus they were\ndefeated.\n\n8\\. He who knows this, becomes great by himself, while the evil enemy who\nhates him, is defeated.\n\n9\\. He (the breath) is death (when he departs), and immortality (while he\nabides).\n\n10\\. And this has been said by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. I, 164, 38):--\n\n11\\. 'Downwards and upwards he (the wind of the breath) goes, held by food;'--\nfor this up-breathing, being held back by the down-breathing, does not move\nforward (and leave the body altogether).\n\n12\\. 'The immortal dwells with the mortal;'--for through him (the breath) all\nthis dwells together, the bodies being clearly mortal, but this being (the\nbreath), being immortal.\n\np. 214\n\n13\\. 'These two (body and breath) go for ever in different directions (the\nbreath moving the senses of the body, the body supporting the senses of the\nbreath: the former going upwards to another world, the body dying and\nremaining on earth). They increase the one (the body), but they do not\nincrease the other,' i. e. they increase these bodies (by food), but this\nbeing (breath) is immortal.\n\n14\\. He who knows this becomes immortal in that world (having become united\nwith Hira _n_ yagarbha), and is seen as immortal (in the sun) by all beings,\nyea, by all beings.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[212:1](sbe01209.htm#fr_524) Having described how Pra _n_ a, the breath, and\nhis companions or servants created the world, he now discusses the question of\nthe material cause of the world out of which it was created. Water, which is\nsaid to be the material of the world, is explained by the commentator to mean\nhere the five elements.\n\n[212:2](sbe01209.htm#fr_525) Cause and effect are not entirely separated,\ntherefore water, as the elementary cause, and earth, fire, &c., as its effect,\nare one; likewise the worshipper, as the father, and the earth, fire, &c. as\nhis sons, as described above. Mula and tula, root and shoot, are evidently\nchosen for the sake of the rhyme, to signify cause and effect.\n\n[213:1](sbe01209.htm#fr_526) Pra _n_ a is called the giri _h_ , because it is\nswallowed or hidden by the other senses (gira _n_ at). Again a mere play of\nwords, intended to show that Brahman under the form of Pra _n_ a, or life, is\nto be meditated on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 1](sbe01210.htm)\n\n"
