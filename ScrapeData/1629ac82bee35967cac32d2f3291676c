The Devi said :-- "O Devas! You are not at all worthy to see this My\nWonderful Cosmic Form. Where are Ye! and where is this My Form! But it is my\naffection towards the Bhaktas that I have shewn to you all this great form of\nmine. Nobody can see this form without My Grace; the study of the Vedas, the\nYoga, the gift, the Sacrifice, the austerities or any other Sadhanas are quite\nincompetent to make this form visible to anybody. O King of mountains! Now\nhear the real instructions. The Great Self is the only Supreme Thing in this\nworld of Maya (Illusions). He it is that under the various Upadhis of an actor\nand enjoyer performs various functions leading to the Dharma (righteousness)\nand the Adharma (unrighteouss). Then he goes into various wombs and enjoys\npleasure or pain according to his Karma. Then again owing to the tendencies\npertaining to these births he becomes engaged in various functions and gets\nagain various bodies and enjoys varieties of pleasures and pains. O Best of\nMountains! There is no cessation of these births and deaths; it is like a\nregular clockwork machine; it has no beginning and it goes on working to an\nendless period. Ignorance or Avidya is the Cause of this Samsara. Desire comes\nout of this and action flows thence. So men ought to try their best to get rid\nof this Ignorance. O King of Mountains! What more to say than this that the\nGoal of life is attained when this Ignorance is destroyed. The highest goal is\nattained by a Jiva, when he becomes liberated, while living . And Vidya is the\nonly thing that is able and skilful in destroying this Ignorance. (As darkness\ncannot dispel darkness, so) the Karma done out of Ignorance is Ignorance\nitself; and such a work cannot destroy Ignorance. So it is not proper to\nexpect that this Avidya can be destroyed by doing works. The works are\nentirely futile. The Jivas want again and again the sensual enjoyments out of\nthis Karma. Attachment arises out of this desire; discrepancies creep in and\nout of this ignorant attachment great calamities befall when such faults or\ndiscrepancies are committed. So every sane man ought to make his best effort\nto get this J\xc3\xb1anam (knowledge). And as it is also enjoined in the S\'rutis that\none ought to do actions (and try to live one hundred years) so it is advisable\nto do works also. Again the S\'rutis declate that the "final liberation comes\nfrom\n\np. 715\n\nKnowledge" so one ought to acquire J\xc3\xb1anam. If both these be collectively\nfollowed, then works become beneficial and helping to J\xc3\xb1anam. (Therefore the\nJivas should take up both of these.) Others say that this is impossible owing\nto their contradictory natures. The knots of heart are let loose by J\xc3\xb1anam and\nthe knots are knit more by Karma. So how can they be reconciled? They are so\nvery diametrically opposite. Darkness and light cannot be brought together, so\nJ\xc3\xb1anam and Karma cannot be brought together. Therefore one ought to do all the\nKarmas as best as one can, as enjoined in the Vedas, until one gets\nChittas\'uddhi (the purification of one\'s heart and mind). Karmas are to be\ndone until S\'ama (the control of the inner organs of senses), Dama (the\ncontrol of the outer organs of senses), Titik _s_ a (the power to endure heat\nand cold and other dualities), Vairagyam (Dispassion), Sattva Sambhava (the\nbirth of pure Sattva Gu _n_ a in one\'s own heart) take place. After these, the\nKarmas cease for that man. Then one ought to take Sannyasa from a Guru\n(Spiritual Teacher) who has got his senses under control, who is versed in the\nS\'rutis, attached to Brahma (practising the Yogic union with Brahma). He\nshould approach to him with an unfeigned Bhakti. He should day and night,\nwithout any laziness, do S\'rava _n_ am, Mananam, and Nididhyasanam (hearing,\nthinking and deeply realising) the Vedanta sayings. He should constantly\nponder over the meanings of the Mahavakyam "Tat Tyam Asi." "Tat Tyam Asi"\nmeans Thou art That; it asserts the identity of the Supreme Self (Brahma) and\nEmbodied Self (Jivatma). When this identity is realised, fearlessness comes\nand he then gets My nature. First of all, he should try to realise (by\nreasoning) the idea conveyed by that sentence. By the word "Tat" is meant\nMyself, of the nature of Brahman; and by the word "Tvam" is meant  "Jiva"\nembodied self and the word "Asi" indicates, no doubt, the identity of these\ntwo. The two words "Tat" and "Tvam" cannot be apparently identified, as they\nseem to convey contradictory meanings ("Tat" implying omniscience,\nomnipresence, and other universal qualities and "Tvam" implying non-\nomniscience and other qualities of a limited nature). So to establish the\nidentity between the two, one ought to adopt Bhagalak _s_ mana and Tyagalak\n_s_ mana. [ _N. B._ --Bhagalak _s_ mana \\-- kind of Lak _s_ ma _n_ a or\nsecondary use of a word by which it partly loses and partly retains its\nprimary meaning also called Jahadajahallak _s_ a _n_ a. Tyaga Laksmana \\-- a\nsecondary use of a word by which it loses partly its primary meaning.\n\n23-40. The Supreme Self is Brahma -- Consciousness, endowed with the\nomniscience, etc., and.the Embodied Self is Limited Jiva Consciousness, etc.)\nLeaving aside their both the adjuncts, we take the Consciousness,\n\np. 716\n\nwhen both of them are indentical and we come to Brahma, without a second. The\nexample is now quoted to illustrate what is called Bhagalak _s_ a _n_ a and\nTyagalak _s_ a _n_ a. "This is that Devadatta" means Devadatta seen before and\nDevadatta seen now means one and the same person, if we leave aside the time\npast and the time present take the body of Devadatta only. This gross body\narises from the Pa _n_ chikrita gross elements. It is the receptacle of\nenjoying the fruits of its Karma and liable to disease and old age. This body\nis all Maya; therefore it has certainly no real existence. O Lord of\nMountains! Know this to be the gross Upadhi (limitation) of My real Self. The\nfive J\xc3\xb1anendriyas (organs of senses), five Karmendriyas (working organs), the\nPra _n_ a Vayus, mind and Buddhi (rational intellect), in all, these seventeen\ngo to form the subtle body, Suk _s_ ma Deha. So the Pundits say. This body of\nthe Supreme Self is caused by the Apanchikrita five original elements. Through\nthis body, pain and pleasure are felt in the heart. This is the second Upadhi\nof the \xc3\x82tman. The Aj\xc3\xb1ana or Primeval Ignoranee, without beginning and\nindescribable, is the third body of the \xc3\x82tman. Know this also to be my third\nUpadhi. When all these Upadhis subside, only the Supreme Self, the Brahman\nremains. Within these three gross and subtle bodies, the five sheaths,\nAnnamaya, Pra _n_ amaya, Vij\xc3\xb1anamaya, and \xc3\x82nandamaya always exist. When these\nare renounced, Brahmapuchcha is obtained. That is Brahma and My Nature, too.\nThis is the Goal of "Not this, Not this" the Vedanta words. This Self is not\nborn nor It dies. It does not live also, being born. (But it remains constant,\nthough It is not born). This Self is unborn, eternal, everlasting, ancient. It\nis not killed, when the body is killed. If one wants to kill it or thinks It\nas slain, both of them do not know; this does not kill nor is it killed. This\n\xc3\x82tman, subtler than the subtlest, and greater than the greatest, resides\nwithin the cave (the Buddhi) of the Jivas. He whose heart is purified and who\nis free from Sankalpa and Vikalpa (doubt and mental phenomena), knows It and\nIts glory and is free from sorrows and troubles. Know this \xc3\x82tman and Buddhi as\nthe charioteer, this body as the chariot, and the mind as the reins. The\nsenses and their organs are the horses and the objects of enjoyments are their\naims. The sages declare that the \xc3\x82tman united with mind and organs of senses\nenjoys the objects. He who is non-discriminating, unmindful, and always\nimpure, does not realise his \xc3\x82tman; rather he is bound in this world. He who\nis discriminating, mindful, and always pure reaches the Goal, realises the\nHighest Self; and he is not fallen again from That. That man becomes able to\ncross the Ocean of Samsara and gets My\n\np. 717\n\nHighest Abode, of the nature of everlasting Existence, Intelligence and Bliss,\nwhose charioteer is Discrimination, and who keeps his senses under control by\nkeeping tight the reins of his mind. Thus one should always meditate intensely\non Me to realise the nature of Self by S\'ravanam (hearing), Mananam thinking\nand realising one\'s own self by one\'s Self (pure heart).\n\n41-44. When by the constant practice, as mentioned above, one\'s heart is fit\nfor Samadhi (being absorbed in the Spirit), just before that, he should\nunderstand the meanings of the separate letters in the seed Mantra of\nMahamaya. The letter "Ha" means gross body and the letter "Ra" means subtle\nbody and the letter "\xc3\x8e" means the causal body; the (dot over the semicircle)\nis the fourth "Turiya" state of Mine. Thus meditating on the separate\ndifferentiated states, the intelligent man should meditate on the aforesaid\nthree Vijas in the Cosmic body also and he should then try to establish the\nidentity between the two. Before enteriing into Samadhi, after very carefully\nthinking the above, one should close one\'s eyes and meditate on Me, the\nSupreme Deity of the Universe, the Luminous and Self-Ellulgent Brahma.\n\n45-50. O Chief of Mountains! Putting a stop to all worldly desires, free from\njealousy and other evils, he should (by constant practice of Pra _n_ ayama)\nmake equal according to the rules of Pra _n_ ayama, the Pra _n_ a (the inhaled\nbreath) and Apa _n_ a (the exhaled breath) Vayus and with an unfeigned\ndevotion get the gross body (Vais\'vanara) indicated by the letter "Ha"\ndissolved in the subtle body Taijasa. The Taijasa body, the letter "Ra" is in\na cave where there is no noise (in the Su _s_ um _n_ a cave). After that He\nshould dissolve the Taijasa, "Ra" into the Causal body "\xc3\x8e". He should then\ndissolve the Causal body, the Praj\xc3\xb1a "\xc3\x8e" into the Turiya state Hrim. Then he\nshould go into a region where there is no speech or the thing spoken, which is\nabsolutely free from dualities, that Akha _nd_ a Sachchidananda and meditate\non that Highest Self in the midst of the Fiery Flame of Consciousness. O King\nof Mountains! Thus men by the meditation mentioned above, should realise the\nidentity between the Jiva and Brahma and see Me and get My Nature. O Lord of\nMountains! Thus the firmly resolved intelligent man, by the practice of this\nYoga sees and realises the nature of My Highest Self and destroys immediately\nthe Ignorance and all the actions thereof.\n\nHere ends the Thirty-fourth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the Knowledge,\nFinal Emancipation in the Maha Pura _n_ am, S\'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of\n18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 35](bk07ch35.htm)\n\n'
