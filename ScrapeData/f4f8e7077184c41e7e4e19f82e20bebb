North of the \xc3\x82havaniya he places a hundred, or more than a hundred,\ncows of that relative of his. The reason why he does so is this:\n\n5:4:3:22\\. When Varu _n_ a was consecrated, his energy, his vigour departed\nfrom him. Probably 2 that collected essence (life-sap) of the waters wherewith\nthey were sprinkling him, drove out his energy, his vigour. He found it in the\ncattle, and because he found it in them, therefore cattle are an object of\nrespect. And having found it in the cattle, he again took to himself his\nenergy, his vigour. And in like manner this one;--that energy does not indeed\ndepart from him, but he does it (thinking), 'This Ra _g_ asuya is Varu _n_ a's\nconsecration, and Varu _n_ a did so.'\n\n5:4:3:33\\. He takes down the chariot (from the stand 3); for whatever turns\naway from the warrior (ra _g_ anya) that he overtakes with his chariot: for\nthis reason he takes down the chariot.\n\n5:4:3:44\\. He takes it down with (Va _g_. S. X, 21), 'Thou art Indra's\nthunderbolt!' The chariot is indeed a thunderbolt; and the Sacrificer is\nIndra;--he is Indra for a twofold reason, namely because he is a\n\np. 99\n\n[paragraph continues] Kshatriya, and because he is a Sacrificer: therefore he\nsays, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art.'\n\n5:4:3:55\\. Having turned it (so as to stand) inside the Vedi, he yokes it\nwith, 'I yoke thee by the direction of Mitra and Varu _n_ a, the directors 1;'\nfor Mitra and Varu _n_ a are the two arms, and by his arms the Ra _g_ anya\nbelongs to Mitra and Varu _n_ a that is why he says, 'I yoke thee by direction\nof Mitra and Varu _n_ a, the directors.'\n\n5:4:3:66\\. He yokes it with four (horses). He passes along by the same way as\nthat on which the dakshi _n_ as 2 go,--behind the Sadas, and in front of the\nhall. He stops it behind the _k_ atvala, and in front of the \xc3\x82gnidhra.\n\n5:4:3:77\\. He mounts it with, 'For unfeebleness (I mount) thee, for svadha 3\n(I mount) thee!'--by 'for unfeebleness thee' he means to say, 'for a state\nfree from afflictions (I mount) thee;' by 'for svadha thee' he means to say,\n'for life-sap (I mount) thee;'--'I, the unharmed Ar _g_ una!' Now Indra is\ncalled Ar _g_ una, which is his mystic name; and this (king) is Indra for a\ntwofold reason, namely because he is a Kshatriya, and because he is a\nSacrificer: therefore he says, 'the unharmed Ar _g_ una.'\n\n5:4:3:88\\. He then goads on the right yoke-horse, with, 'Conquer thou by the\nimpulse of the Maruts!' For the Maruts are the clansmen, and it is by his\n\np. 100\n\nclan that the chieftain wins what he desires to win: therefore he says,\n'Conquer thou by the impulse of the Maruts!'\n\n5:4:3:99\\. He then stops (the chariot) in the midst of the cows 1, with, 'May\nwe obtain by the mind!' For it is by the mind that everything here (that is\nobtained) is obtained; and by the mind therefore he now obtains everything:\ntherefore he says, 'May we obtain by the mind!'\n\n5:4:3:1010\\. He then touches a cow with the end of the bow, with, 'Together\nwith energy!'--energy means vigour, kine: it is energy, vigour, he thereby\ntakes to himself. And he adds, 'I overpower them, I seize them!'\n\n5:4:3:1111\\. Now as to why he stops amidst the cows of his relative,--whatever\nis tending away from a man, be it either fame, or anything else, that passes\nover to his relative foremost of all;--that energy, or vigour, he now takes\nagain from his relative to himself: that is why he stops amidst the cows of\nhis relative.\n\n5:4:3:1212\\. In return he presents to him just as many (cows) 2, or more. For\nassuredly he, the Sacrificer,\n\np. 101\n\nis not capable of a cruel deed; but cruelly indeed he acts when he says, 'I\noverpower them, I seize them;' and thus that is done by him without cruelty:\nthis is why, in return, he presents to him just as many (cows) or more.\n\n5:4:3:1313\\. He then pulls the right-side (horses, or reins). He passes along\non the same way as that on which the dakshi _n_ a (cows) go,--in front of the\nsacrificial post, and along the south of the Vedi. Behind the Sadas, and in\nfront of the hall, he stops that (car).\n\n5:4:3:1414\\. [Va _g_. S. X, 22], 'Lest, O Indra, overpowerer of the mighty, we\nbe wanting thee, heedless through ungodliness,--mount thou, O divine wielder\nof the thunderbolt, the chariot which thou restrainest (as well as its) well-\nhorsed reins 1.' With this (verse) he stops (the chariot);--reins (ra _s_ mi)\nmeans bridle (abhi _s_ u): therefore he says, 'Thou restrainest the well-\nhorsed reins 2???.' Thereupon he offers the (four oblations) relating to the\nunyoking of the chariot. 'Well-pleased the chariot shall be when unyoked,' he\nthinks, and therefore he offers the (oblations) relating to the unyoking of\nthe chariot.\n\n5:4:3:1515\\. He offers with (Va _g_. S. X, 23), 'To Agni, the House-lord,\nhail!' He thereby pleases the part of the chariot relating to Agni; and it is\nthe shoulder-pieces of the chariot that relate to Agni it is the shoulder-\npieces (of the yoke) he thereby pleases. And the house-lord's position means\nprosperity: as much as he (the king) rules over, for\n\np. 102\n\nthe prosperity, the house-lordship, of that his kingship is thereby rendered\nfree (unopposed).\n\n5:4:3:1616\\. 'To Soma, the wood-lord (tree), hail!' There are two kinds of\n(objects) coming from trees, the wheels of chariots and waggons, for both of\nthese he thereby ensures safety. And the wood-lord (tree) being Soma,--\nwhatever part of the chariot comes from the tree, that he thereby pleases. Now\nthe parts of the chariot coming from trees are the wooden pieces of the\nchariot: hence it is the wooden pieces he thereby pleases. And Soma being the\nnobility, it is over the nobility that his kingship is thereby rendered free.\n\n5:4:3:1717\\. 'To the strength of the Maruts, hail!' He thereby pleases the\npart of the chariot belonging to the Maruts,--there are four horses, the\nchariot the fifth, and the warrior (chariot-fighter) and charioteer two--these\nare seven, and the host of the Maruts consists of (troops of) seven each: he\nthereby pleases the whole chariot; and the Maruts being the peasants, it is\nover the peasantry that his kingship is thereby rendered free.\n\n5:4:3:1818\\. 'To Indra's energy, hail!' He thereby pleases the part of the\nchariot that belongs to Indra. Now the warrior relates to Indra, and it is the\nwarrior he thereby pleases. And Indra's energy (indriya) means the vigour in\nIndra 1: it is in regard to energy, vigour, that his kingship is thereby\nrendered free.\n\n5:4:3:1919\\. He then puts on shoes of boar's skin. Now the gods once put a pot\nof ghee on the fire. Therefrom a boar was produced: hence the boar is fat,\n\np. 103\n\nfor it was produced from ghee. Hence also cows readily take to a boar: it is\nindeed their own essence (life-sap, blood) they are readily taking to. Thus he\nfirmly establishes himself in the essence of the cattle: therefore he puts on\nshoes of boar's skin.\n\n5:4:3:2020\\. Looking down on this (earth) he then mutters, 'O mother Earth,\ninjure me not, nor I thee!' For the Earth was once afraid of Varu _n_ a, when\nhe had been consecrated, thinking, 'Something great surely has he become now\nthat he has been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder!' And Varu\n_n_ a also was afraid of the Earth, thinking, 'I fear lest she may shake me\noff!' Hence by that (formula) he entered into a friendly relation with her;\nfor a mother does not injure her son, nor does a son injure his mother.\n\n5:4:3:2121\\. Now this Ra _g_ asuya is Varu _n_ a's consecration; and the Earth\nis afraid of him, thinking, 'Something great surely has he become now that he\nhas been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder!' And he also is\nafraid of her, thinking, 'I fear lest she may shake me off.' Hence he thereby\nenters into a friendly relation with her; for a mother does not injure her\nson, nor does a son injure his mother: therefore he mutters thus.\n\n5:4:3:2222\\. He steps down (from the chariot), muttering this ati _kh_ andas\nverse (Va _g_. S. X, 24; _Ri_ k S. IV, 40, 5), 'The swan dwelling in the\nlight, the Vasu dwelling in the air, the priest seated on the altar, the guest\ndwelling in the retreat (house),--the man-dwelling, the space-dwelling 1, the\nlaw-dwelling, the sphere-dwelling, the water-born,\n\np. 104\n\ncow-born, law-born, rock-born (is) the great [law](errata.htm#9).' For that\nati _kh_ andas (or excessive metre) comprises all the metres: thus evil does\nnot descend along with him.\n\n5:4:3:2323\\. Let not the charioteer get down along with (or, after) him, lest\nhe should descend on the same world on which the anointed (king) has just\ndescended. They put him up, along with the chariot, on the car-stand. Thence\nhe leaps down: thus he does not descend on the same world on which the\nanointed has just descended 1.\n\n5:4:3:2424\\. North of the \xc3\x82havaniya is the original fire, taken up (from the\nhearth 2). Behind the right hind-wheel of the cart-stand he fastens two round\n_s_ atamanas 3.\n\n5:4:3:2525\\. He then hides an udumbara (ficus glomerata) branch (in the wheel-\ntrack). He touches one of those two (plates), with (Va _g_. S. X, 25), 'So\ngreat thou art, life thou art: bestow life upon me! A yoke-mate thou art,\nlustre thou art: bestow lustre upon me!' He thereby takes life and lustre to\nhimself.\n\n5:4:3:2626\\. He then touches the udumbara branch, with, 'Sustenance thou art:\nbestow sustenance upon me!' He thereby takes sustenance (strength) to himself.\nThose same two round _s_ atamanas are the fee for this ceremony. He gives them\nto the\n\np. 105\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman priest, for the Brahman protects the sacrifice\nfrom the south: therefore he gives them to the Brahman.\n\n5:4:3:2727\\. In front of the Maitravaru _n_ a's hearth the dish of curds for\nMitra and Varu _n_ a has been deposited. He draws down to it his (the\nSacrificer's) two arms 1, with, 'I draw you down, the arms of Indra, the doer\nof mighty deeds.' Now curds are the essence of cattle: hence it is to the\nessence of cattle that he thereby brings down his (the Sacrificer's) arms. And\nas to its being for Mitra-Varu _n_ a, it is because Mitra and Varu _n_ a are\nthe two arms.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[98:1](sbe4119.htm#fr_193) The meaning of krivi (krayi, Taitt. S.) is\ndoubtful. Mahidhara derives it from 'kar' (to make or injure), in the sense of\neither 'efficacious,' or 'destructive.'--A Grantha MS. of the Ka _n_ va text\nreads kavi, 'wise.'\n\n[98:2](sbe4120.htm#fr_194) I am now inclined to think that some such meaning\nas 'probably, perhaps' (more nearly, German 'wohl'), fits all the passages (in\nthe Brahma _n_ as at all events) where _s_ a _s_ vat occurs.\n\n[98:3](sbe4120.htm#fr_195) See above, [V, 1, 4, 3](sbe4106.htm#5:1:4:3) seq.\n\n[99:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_196) Pra _s_ ast _ri_ , 'the director,' is also another\nname for the Maitravaru _n_ a priest.\n\n[99:2](sbe4120.htm#fr_197) That is, the cows given to priests as sacrificial\nfee. For particulars regarding the passage by which they are driven to their\ndestination, see part ii, p. 344, note 1.\n\n[99:3](sbe4120.htm#fr_198) Probably here 'for well-being;' the author,\nhowever, evidently takes it here in the sense of 'invigorating potion,' the\ndrink offered to the deceased ancestors.\n\n[100:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_199) In the ceremonial of the Black Ya _g_ us a sham-\nfight takes place here. East or north of the sacrificial ground a Ra _g_ anya\nhas posted himself with bow in hand. The king discharges the arrows at him,\nwith, 'Obtained is the mind!' and having thus, as it were, overpowered the\nenemy, ne wheels round in a sunwise direction, with, 'I (have become endowed)\nwith energy, with vigour!' He then puts on shoes of boar's skin, with, 'Thou\nart the mettle of cattle,' gets down from the chariot, and puts on ornaments\nof silver, copper (as Saya _n_ a here interprets audumbara), and gold\n(afterwards to be given to the Brahman). Then follow the oblations relating to\nthe unyoking of the chariot. Taitt. S. I, 8, 15, with commentary.\n\n[100:2](sbe4120.htm#fr_200) Viz. as many as he has taken from him, a hundred\nor more.\n\n[101:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_201) For a different version of this somewhat awkwardly\nconstructed verse, see _Ri_ k S. V, 33, 3.\n\n[101:2](sbe4120.htm#fr_202) The explanation is given because the word has also\nthe meaning 'ray.'\n\n[102:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_203) ? Or, means vigour, Indra.\n\n[103:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_204) Or perhaps, 'in the best place (vara).' See [VI,\n7, 3, 11](sbe4151.htm#6:7:3:11).\n\n[104:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_205) According to Taitt. Br. I, 7, 9, 6, the king, on\nreturning to the Vedi, is supposed to have ascended to the heavenly world\n(suvargaloka), from which the charioteer is to be excluded by this expedient.\n\n[104:2](sbe4120.htm#fr_206) The \xc3\x82havaniya of the hall (the so-called 'hall-\ndoor fire') has been lifted and placed on a cart.\n\n[104:3](sbe4120.htm#fr_207) Or, two round (gold) plates, weighing a hundred\nmina (or berries of Gu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a, or Abrus Precatorius, the average weight of\nwhich is stated to be 1 5/16 grains Troy).\n\n[105:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_208) Whilst this is done, the king stands on the\ntiger's skin, and the Adhvaryu hands him his bow and arrows. Thereupon the\ndish of curds is taken to the uttaravedi to be proceeded with. Katy. _S_ r.\nXV, 6, 34-35.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 4, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe4121.htm)\n\n"
