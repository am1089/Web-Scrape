When the Devas and Asuras 2 struggled together, both of the race of Pra\n_g_ apati, the Devas took the udgitha 3 (Om), thinking they would vanquish the\nAsuras with it.\n\n2\\. They meditated on the udgitha 3 (Om) as the breath (scent) in the nose 4,\nbut the Asuras pierced it (the breath) with evil. Therefore we smell by the\nbreath in the nose both what is good-smelling and what is bad-smelling. For\nthe breath was pierced by evil.\n\n3\\. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as speech, but the Asuras pierced\nit with evil. Therefore we speak both truth and falsehood. For speech is\npierced by evil.\n\n4\\. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the eye, but the Asuras pierced\nit with evil. Therefore\n\np. 5\n\nwe see both what is sightly and unsightly. For the eye is pierced by evil.\n\n5\\. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the ear, but the Asuras pierced\nit with evil. Therefore we hear both what should be heard and what should not\nbe heard. For the car is pierced by evil.\n\n6\\. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the mind, but the Asuras\npierced it with evil. Therefore we conceive both what should be conceived and\nwhat should not be conceived. For the mind is pierced by evil.\n\n7\\. Then comes this breath (of life) in the mouth 1. They meditated on the\nudgitha (Om) as that breath. When the Asuras came to it, they were scattered,\nas (a ball of earth) would be scattered when hitting a solid stone.\n\n8\\. Thus, as a ball of earth is scattered when hitting on a solid stone, will\nhe be scattered who wishes evil to one who knows this, or who persecutes him;\nfor he is a solid stone.\n\n9\\. By it (the breath in the mouth) he distinguishes neither what is good nor\nwhat is bad-smelling, for that breath is free from evil. What we eat and drink\nwith it supports the other vital breaths (i. e. the senses, such as smell,\n&c.) When at the time of death he 2 does not find that breath (in the\n\np. 6\n\nmouth, through which he eats and drinks and lives), then he departs. He opens\nthe mouth at the time of death (as if wishing to eat).\n\n10\\. A\xe1\xb9\x85giras 1 meditated on the udgitha (Om) as that breath, and people hold\nit to be A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, i. e. the essence of the members (angana _m_ rasa _h_ );\n\n11\\. Therefore B _ri_ haspati meditated on udgitha (Om) as that breath, and\npeople hold it to be B _ri_ haspati, for speech is b _ri_ hati, and he (that\nbreath) is the lord (pati) of speech;\n\n12\\. Therefore Ayasya meditated on the udgitha (Om) as that breath, and people\nhold it to be Ayasya, because it comes (ayati) from the mouth (asya);\n\n13\\. Therefore Vaka Dalbhya knew it. He was the Udgat _ri_ (singer) of the\nNaimishiya-sacrificers, and by singing he obtained for them their wishes.\n\n14\\. He who knows this, and meditates on the syllable Om (the imperishable\nudgitha) as the breath of life in the mouth, he obtains all wishes by singing.\nSo much for the udgitha (Om) as meditated on with reference to the body 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[4:1](sbe01023.htm#fr_77) A very similar story is told in the B _ri_ had-\naranyaka I, 1, 3, 1. But though the coincidences between the two are\nconsiderable, amounting sometimes to verbal identity, the purport of the two\nseems to be different. See Vedanta-sutra III, 3, 6.\n\n[4:2](sbe01023.htm#fr_78) Devas and Asuras, gods and demons, are here\nexplained by the commentator as the good and evil inclinations of man; Pra _g_\napati as man in general.\n\n[4:3](sbe01023.htm#fr_80) Udgitha stands, according to the commentator, for\nthe sacrificial act to be performed by the Udgat _ri_ , the Sama-veda priest,\nwith the udgitha hymns; and as these sacrificial acts always form part of the\n_G_ yotish _t_ oma &c., these great Soma-sacrifices are really intended. In\nthe second place, however, the commentator takes udgitha in the sense of Udgat\n_ri_ , the performer of the udgitha, which is or was by the Devas thought to\nbe the breath in the nose. I have preferred to take udgitha in the sense of\nOm, and all that is implied by it.\n\n[4:4](sbe01023.htm#fr_81) They asked that breath should recite the udgitha.\nComm.\n\n[5:1](sbe01023.htm#fr_82) Mukhya pra _n_ a is used in two senses, the\nprincipal or vital breath, also called sresh _th_ a, and the breath in the\nmouth, also called asanya.\n\n[5:2](sbe01023.htm#fr_83) According to the commentator, the assemblage of the\nother vital breaths or senses is here meant. They depart when the breath of\nthe mouth, sometimes called sarvambhari, all-supporting, does no longer, by\neating and drinking, support them.\n\n[6:1](sbe01023.htm#fr_84) The paragraphs from 10 to 14 are differently\nexplained by Indian commentators. By treating the nominatives a\xe1\xb9\x85giras, b _ri_\nhaspatis, and ayasyas (here the printed text reads ayasyam) as accusatives, or\nby admitting the omission of an iti after them, they connect paragraphs 9, 10,\nand 11 with paragraph 12, and thus gain the meaning that Vaka Dalbhya\nmeditated on the breath in the mouth as A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, B _ri_ haspati, and Ayasya,\ninstead of those saints having themselves thus meditated; and that he, knowing\nthe secret names and qualities of the breath, obtained, when acting as Udgat\n_ri_ priest, the wishes of those for whom he sacrificed. Tena is difficult to\nexplain, unless we take it in the sense of tenanu _s_ ish _t_ ah, taught by\nhim.\n\n[6:2](sbe01023.htm#fr_85) Adhyatma means with reference to the body, not with\nreference to the self or the soul. Having explained the symbolical p. 7\nmeaning of Om as applied to the body and its organs of sense, he now explains\nits symbolical meaning adhidaivatam, i.e. as applied to divine beings.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3](sbe01024.htm)\n\n'
