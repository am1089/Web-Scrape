As one who runs a race [1](sbe46058.htm#an_2:8:1:1) (praises) his\nchariots, praise thou the yoking of Agni (to the chariot of sacrifice), of the\nmost glorious, bountiful (god)--\n\n2\\. Who is the best leader for his worshipper, who undecaying makes the malign\ndecay [1](sbe46058.htm#an_2:8:2:1), the cheerful-faced who has been worshipped\nwith offerings--\n\n3\\. He who is praised in the houses on account of his beauty in the evening\nand at dawn, whose law is not set at nought,\n\n4\\. The bright one who shines with his light as the Sun with his splendour,\nwith his undecaying (flames) [1](sbe46058.htm#an_2:8:4:1), he who is anointed\n(with gh _ri_ ta).\n\n5\\. The hymns have strengthened Agni the devourer [1](sbe46058.htm#an_2:8:5:1)\nalong (the extent of) his own royalty [2](sbe46058.htm#an_2:8:5:2). He has\nassumed every beauty.\n\n6\\. May we unharmed stand under the protection of Agni, Indra, Soma, of the\ngods; may we overcome our foes.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is G _ri_ tsamada; the metre is Gayatri, the last verse being\nAnush _t_ ubh, as is frequently the case in Gayatri hymns (see H. O., Hymnen\ndes Rig-veda, I, 146).--No verse occurs in the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Va _g_ ayati means 'he strives for va _g_ a,' va _g_ ayati 'he incites\nto quickness.' The accent is not always correct in the traditional text.\n\np. 214\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. II, 16, 1. indram a _g_ uryam _g_ arayantam.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. As to a _g_ arai _h_ , 'the undecaying (flames),' comp. III, 18, 2;\nVI, 5, 4; 6, 2; VII, 3, 3; X, 87, 20.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. That Agni should be identified here with the _Ri_ shi Atri (see\nBergaigne, II, 468) is very improbable. Possibly atri means simply 'the eater'\n(from ad), though the poet in calling him so may have intended to allude to\nthe name of the _Ri_ shi.\n\nNote 2. Comp. I, 80, I seq. ar _k_ an anu svara\xc2\xb4 _g_ yam; 84, 10 seq. vasvi\n_h_ anu svara\xc2\xb4 _g_ yam.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 9](sbe46059.htm)\n\n"
