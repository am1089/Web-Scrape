(The descending souls enter) into (plants) animated by other (souls), as\nin the previous cases, on account of scriptural declaration.\n\nIn the description of the souls' descent we read, after their coming down in\nraindrops has been mentioned, 'Then they are born as rice and corn, herbs and\ntrees, sesamum and beans.'--Here a doubt arises whether, at this stage of\ntheir descent, the souls to which a remainder of their works continues to\ncling really pass over into the different species of those immoveable things\n(plants) and enjoy their pleasures and pains, or if they enter merely into a\nstate of conjunction with the bodies of those plants which are animated by\ndifferent souls.--The purvapakshin maintains that they pass over into those\nspecies and enjoy their pleasures and pains, on account of the remainder of\nworks still attaching to them; firstly, because that enables us to take the\nverb 'to be born' in its literal sense; secondly, because we know from _S_\nruti and Sm _ri_ ti that the condition of a plant may be a place of enjoyment\n(of the fruits of actions); and thirdly, because sacrifices and similar\nactions, being connected with harm done to animals, &c., may lead to\nunpleasant results. We therefore take the 'being born as rice,' &c., of those\nto whom a remainder of their works attaches, in its literal sense, and\nconsider the case to be analogous to that of a man who is born either as a dog\nor a hog or a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala, where we have to understand that the man\nreally becomes a dog, and so on, and experiences the pleasures and pains\nconnected with that condition.\n\nTo this reasoning we reply as follows:--The souls to which a remainder\nattaches enter merely into conjunction with rice plants, &c., which are\nalready animated by other souls; and do not enjoy their pleasures and pains;\n'as in the previous cases.' As the souls' becoming air, smoke, &c., was\ndecided to mean only that they become connected with them 1, so here too their\nbecoming rice, &c. merely means that they\n\np. 130\n\nbecome connected with those plants--How is this known?--From the fact of the\nstatement here also being of the same nature--Of what nature?--Here, also, as\nin the case of the souls becoming ether, &c., down to rain, the text does not\nrefer to any operation of the works; hence we conclude that the souls do not\nenjoy pleasure and pain. Where, on the other hand, the text wants to intimate\nthat the souls undergo pleasure and pain, there it refers to the operation of\nthe former works; so e.g. in the passage which treats of men of good or evil\nconduct. Moreover, if we should take the souls' being born as rice, &c., in\nits literal sense, it would follow that when the rice plants are reaped,\nunhusked, split, cooked and eaten, the souls which have descended into them\nand are animating them would have to leave them; it being generally known that\nwhen a body is destroyed the soul animating it abandons it. And then (if the\nsouls left the plants) the text could not state (as it does state. V, 10, 6)\nthat the souls which had entered into the plants are transmitted by animal\ngeneration (on the part of those who eat the plants). Hence it follows that\nthe souls which have descended are merely outwardly connected with the plants\nanimated by other souls. This suffices to refute the assertions that 'to be\nborn' must be taken in its literal sense; and that the state of vegetable\nexistence affords a place for enjoyment. We do not entirely deny that\nvegetable existence may afford a place for enjoyment; it may do so in the case\nof other beings which, in consequence of their unholy deeds, have become\nplants. We only maintain that those souls which descend from the moon with an\nunrequited remainder of works do not experience the enjoyment connected with\nplant life.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[129:1](sbe38100.htm#fr_99) This does not agree well with what had been said\nabove about the souls becoming similar to ether, air, &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 25](sbe38101.htm)\n\n"
