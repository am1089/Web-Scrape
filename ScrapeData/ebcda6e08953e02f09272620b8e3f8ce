May they enjoy what thou givest them in our oblation. Svadha! Adoration!\n\n'Your limb that this flesh-devouring (Agni) has burnt, leading you to the\nworlds (of the Fathers), _G_ atavedas, that I restore to you again. Unviolated\nwith all your limbs arise, O Fathers! Svadha! Adoration!\n\n'Carry the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, _G_ atavedas, to the Fathers, where thou knowest them\nresting afar. May streams of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya flow to them; may their wishes with all\ntheir desires be fulfilled! Svadha! Adoration!'\n\nIn the same way a second and a third verse with the alteration of the Mantra,\n'to the grandfathers,' 'to the great-grandfathers.'\n\n2\\. In the same way he sacrifices of the food, altering the Mantra, 'Carry the\nfood, &c.'\n\n3\\. Then he sacrifices the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t oblation\n\np. 228\n\nwith (the formula), 'To Agni Kavyavahana Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t svadha!\nAdoration!'\n\n4\\. He then touches the food with (the formulas), 'The earth is thy vessel,\nthe heaven is the lid. I sacrifice thee into the Brahman's mouth. I sacrifice\nthee into the up-breathing and down-breathing of the Brahma _n_ as. Thou art\nimperishable; do not perish for the Fathers yonder, in yon world! The earth is\nsteady; Agni is its surveyor in order that what has been given may not be\nlost.\n\n'The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is the lid, &c. Do not perish for the\ngrandfathers yonder, in yon world. The air is steady; Vayu is its surveyor, in\norder that what has been given may not be lost.\n\n'The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is the lid, &c. Do not perish for the\ngreat-grandfathers yonder, in yon world. The heaven is steady; \xc3\x82ditya is its\nsurveyor, in order that what has been given may not be lost.'\n\n5. 5 With (the words), 'I establish myself in the breath and sacrifice ambrosia,' he causes the Brahma _n_ as to touch (the food).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[227:1](sbe30083.htm#fr_679) 11, 1. _Ri_ g-veda X, 15, 53; Atharva-veda XVIII,\n4, 64; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya II, 4, 13, &c. Before the verse, 'Carry the \xc3\x82\n_g_ ya,' the Udi _k_ yas, as Mat _ri_ datta states, insert the words, 'He then\nmakes oblations of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya (with the Mantra, &c.).' According to this reading\nthe words of the second Sutra, 'In the same way, &c.,' would refer only to\nthese last oblations.\n\n[228:5](sbe30083.htm#fr_680) Comp.
