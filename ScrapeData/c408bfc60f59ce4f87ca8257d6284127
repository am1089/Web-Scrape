If it be said that (the corporeal individuality of the gods involves) a\ncontradiction to (sacrificial) works; we deny that, on account of the\nobservation of the assumption (on the part of the gods) of several (forms).\n\nIf the right of the gods, and other beings superior to men, to the acquisition\nof knowledge is founded on the assumption of their corporeality, &c., we shall\nhave to admit, in consequence of that corporeality, that Indra and the other\ngods stand in the relation of subordinate members (a _n_ ga) to sacrificial\nacts, by means of their being present in person\n\np. 200\n\njust as the priests are. But this admission will lead to 'a contradiction in\nthe sacrificial acts,' because the circumstance of the gods forming the\nmembers of sacrificial acts by means of their personal presence, is neither\nactually observed nor possible. For it is not possible that one and the same\nIndra should, at the same time, be present in person at many sacrifices.\n\nTo this we reply, that there is no such contradiction.--Why?--On account of\nthe assumption of several (forms). For it is possible for one and the same\ndivine Self to assume several forms at the same time.--How is that known?--\nFrom observation.--For a scriptural passage at first replies to the question\nhow many gods there are, by the declaration that there are 'Three and three\nhundred, three and three thousand,' and subsequently, on the question who they\nare, declares 'They (the 303 and 3003) are only the various powers of them, in\nreality there are only thirty-three gods' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 1, 2); showing\nthereby that one and the same divine Self may at the same time appear in many\nforms. After that it proceeds to show that these thirty-three gods themselves\nare in reality contained in six, five, &c., and, finally, by replying to the\nquestion, 'Who is the one god?' that Breath is the one god, shows that the\ngods are all forms of Breath, and that Breath, therefore, can at the same time\nappear in many forms.--Sm _ri_ ti also has a similar statement, 'A Yogin, O\nhero of the Bharatas, may, by his power, multiply his Self in many thousand\nshapes, and in them walk about on the earth. In some he may enjoy the objects,\nin others he may undergo dire penance, and, finally, he may again retract them\nall, just as the sun retracts the multitude of his rays.' If such Sm _ri_ ti\npassages as the above declare that even Yogins, who have merely acquired\nvarious extraordinary powers, such as subtlety of body, and the like, may\nanimate several bodies at the same time, how much more capable of such feats\nmust the gods be, who naturally possess all supernatural powers. The gods thus\nbeing able to assume several shapes, a god may divide himself into many forms\nand enter into relation with many sacrifices at the same time, remaining all\nthe\n\np. 201\n\nwhile unseen by others, in consequence of his power to render himself\ninvisible.\n\nThe latter part of the Sutra may be explained in a different manner also, viz.\nas meaning that even beings enjoying corporeal individuality are seen to enter\ninto mere subordinate relation to more than one action. Sometimes, indeed, one\nindividual does not at the same time enter into subordinate relation to\ndifferent actions; one Brahma _n_ a, for instance, is not at the same time\nentertained by many entertainers. But in other cases one individual stands in\nsubordinate relation to many actions at the same time; one Brahma _n_ a, for\ninstance, may constitute the object of the reverence done to him by many\npersons at the same time. Similarly, it is possible that, as the sacrifice\nconsists in the parting (on the part of the sacrificer with some offering)\nwith a view (to some divinity), many persons may at the same time part with\ntheir respective offerings, all of them having in view one and the same\nindividual divinity. The individuality of the gods does not, therefore,\ninvolve any contradiction in sacrificial works.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 28](sbe34097.htm)\n\n"
