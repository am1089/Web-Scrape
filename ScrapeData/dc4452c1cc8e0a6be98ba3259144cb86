But nowadays I often try to take an outside view--\nto see myself as Bimal sees me. What a dismally solemn picture it makes, my\nhabit of taking things too seriously!\n\nBetter, surely, to laugh away the world than flood it with tears. That is, in\nfact, how the world gets on. We relish our food and rest, only because we can\ndismiss, as so many empty shadows, the sorrows scattered everywhere, both in\nthe home and in the outer world. If we took them as true, even for a moment,\nwhere would be our appetite, our sleep?\n\nBut I cannot dismiss myself as one of these shadows, and so the load of my\nsorrow lies eternally heavy on the heart of my world.\n\nWhy not stand out aloof in the highway of the universe, and feel yourself to\nbe part of the all? In the midst of the immense, age-long concourse of\nhumanity, what is Bimal to you? Your wife? What is a wife? A bubble of a name\nblown big with your own breath, so carefully guarded night and day, yet ready\nto burst at any pin-prick from outside.\n\nMy wife--and so, forsooth, my very own! If she says: "No, I am myself"--am I\nto reply: "How can that be? Are you not mine?"\n\n"My wife"--Does that amount to an argument, much less the truth? Can one\nimprison a whole personality within that name?\n\nMy wife!--Have I not cherished in this little world all that is purest and\nsweetest in my life, never for a moment letting it down from my bosom to the\ndust? What incense of worship, what music of passion, what flowers of my\nspring and of my autumn, have I not offered up at its shrine? If, like a toy\npaper-boat, she be swept along into the muddy waters of the gutter--would I\nnot also...?\n\nThere it is again, my incorrigible solemnity! Why "muddy"? What "gutter,?\nNames, called in a fit of jealousy, do not change the facts of the world. If\nBimal is not mine, she is not; and no fuming, or fretting, or arguing will\nserve to prove that she is. If my heart is breaking--let it break! That will\nnot make the world bankrupt--nor even me; for man is so much greater than the\nthings he loses in this life. The very ocean of tears has its other shore,\nelse none would have ever wept.\n\nBut then there is Society to be considered ... which let Society consider! If\nI weep it is for myself, not for Society. If Bimal should say she is not mine,\nwhat care I where my Society wife may be? Suffering there must be; but I must\nsave myself, by any means in my power, from one form of self-torture: I must\nnever think that my life loses its value because of any neglect it may suffer.\nThe full value of my life does not all go to buy my narrow domestic world; its\ngreat commerce does not stand or fall with some petty success or failure in\nthe bartering of my personal joys and sorrows.\n\nThe time has come when I must divest Bimala of all the ideal decorations with\nwhich I decked her. It was owing to my own weakness that I indulged in such\nidolatry. I was too greedy. I created an angel of Bimala, in order to\nexaggerate my own enjoyment. But Bimala is what she is. It is preposterous to\nexpect that she should assume the role of an angel for my pleasure. The\nCreator is under no obligation to supply me with angels, just because I have\nan avidity for imaginary perfection.\n\nI must acknowledge that I have merely been an accident in Bimala\'s life. Her\nnature, perhaps, can only find true union with one like Sandip. At the same\ntime, I must not, in false modesty, accept my rejection as my desert. Sandip\ncertainly has attractive qualities, which had their sway also upon myself; but\nyet, I feel sure, he is not a greater man than I. If the wreath of victory\nfalls to his lot today, and I am overlooked, then the dispenser of the wreath\nwill be called to judgement.\n\nI say this in no spirit of boasting. Sheer necessity has driven me to the\npass, that to secure myself from utter desolation I must recognize all the\nvalue that I truly possess. Therefore, through the, terrible experience of\nsuffering let there come upon me the joy of deliverance--deliverance from\nself-distrust.\n\nI have come to distinguish what is really in me from what I foolishly imagined\nto be there. The profit and loss account has been settled, and that which\nremains is myself--not a crippled self, dressed in rags and tatters, not a\nsick self to be nursed on invalid diet, but a spirit which has gone through\nthe worst, and has survived.\n\nMy master passed through my room a moment ago and said with his hand on my\nshoulder. "Get away to bed, Nikhil, the night is far advanced."\n\nThe fact is, it has become so difficult for me to go to bed till late--till\nBimal is fast asleep. In the day-time we meet, and even converse, but what am\nI to say when we are alone together, in the silence of the night?--so ashamed\ndo I feel in mind and body.\n\n"How is it, sir, you have not yet retired?" I asked in my turn. My master\nsmiled a little, as he left me, saying: "My sleeping days are over. I have now\nattained the waking age.\n\nI had written thus far, and was about to rise to go off bedwards when, through\nthe window before me, I saw the heavy pall of July cloud suddenly part a\nlittle, and a big star shine through. It seemed to say to me: "Dreamland ties\nare made, and dreamland ties are broken, but I am here for ever--the\neverlasting lamp of the bridal night."\n\nAll at once my heart was full with the thought that my Eternal Love was\nsteadfastly waiting for me through the ages, behind the veil of material\nthings. Through many a life, in many a mirror, have I seen her image--broken\nmirrors, crooked mirrors, dusty mirrors. Whenever I have sought to make the\nmirror my very own, and shut it up within my box, I have lost sight of the\nimage. But what of that. What have I to do with the mirror, or even the image?\n\nMy beloved, your smile shall never fade, and every dawn there shall appear\nfresh for me the vermilion mark on your forehead!\n\n"What childish cajolery of self-deception," mocks some devil from his dark\ncorner--"silly prattle to make children quiet!"\n\nThat may be. But millions and millions of children, with their million cries,\nhave to be kept quiet. Can it be that all this multitude is quieted with only\na lie? No, my Eternal Love cannot deceive me, for she is true!\n\nShe is true; that is why I have seen her and shall see her so often, even in\nmy mistakes, even through the thickest mist of tears. I have seen her and lost\nher in the crowd of life\'s market-place, and found her again; and I shall find\nher once more when I have escaped through the loophole of death.\n\nAh, cruel one, play with me no longer! If I have failed to track you by the\nmarks of your footsteps on the way, by the scent of your tresses lingering in\nthe air, make me not weep for that for ever. The unveiled star tells me not to\nfear. That which is eternal must always be there.\n\nNow let me go and see my Bimala. She must have spread her tired limbs on the\nbed, limp after her struggles, and be asleep. I will leave a kiss on her\nforehead without waking her--that shall be the flower-offering of my worship.\nI believe I could forget everything after death--all my mistakes, all my\nsufferings--but some vibration of the memory of that kiss would remain; for\nthe wreath which is being woven out of the kisses of many a successive birth\nis to crown the Eternal Beloved.\n\nAs the gong of the watch rang out, sounding the hour of two, my sister-in-law\ncame into the room. "Whatever are you doing, brother dear?"  16 she cried.\n"For pity\'s sake go to bed and stop worrying so. I cannot bear to look on that\nawful shadow of pain on your face." Tears welled up in her eyes and overflowed\nas she entreated me thus.\n\nI could not utter a word, but took the dust of her feet, as I went off to bed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[16](hw12.htm#fr_15) When a relationship is established by marriage, or by\nmutual understanding arising out of special friendship or affection, the\npersons so related call each other in terms of such relationship, and not by\nname.
