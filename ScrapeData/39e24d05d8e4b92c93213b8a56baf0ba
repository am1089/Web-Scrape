Krishna, who had stood by Yudhishthir in his prosperity,\nnow came to visit him in his adversity; he consoled Draupadi in her distress,\nand gave good advice to the brothers. Draupadi with a woman\'s pride and anger\nstill thought of her wrongs and insults, and urged Yudhishthir to disregard\nthe conditions of exile and recover his kingdom. Bhima too was of the same\nmind, but Yudhishthir would not be moved from his plighted word.\n\nThe great _rishi_ Vyasa came to visit Yudhishthir, and advised Arjun, great\narcher as he was, to acquire celestial arms by penance and worship. Arjun\nfollowed the advice, met the god SIVA in the guise of a hunter, pleased him by\nhis prowess in combat, and obtained his blessings and the _pasupata_ weapon.\nArjun then went to INDRA\'s heaven and obtained other celestial arms.\n\nIn the meanwhile Duryodhan, not content with sending his cousins to exile,\nwished to humiliate them still more by appearing before them in all his regal\npower and splendour. Matters how ever turned out differently from what he\nexpected, and he became involved in a quarrel with some _gandharvas_ , a class\nof aerial beings. Duryodhan was taken captive by them, and it was the Pandav\nbrothers who released him from his captivity, and allowed him to return to his\nkingdom in peace. This act of generosity rankled in his bosom and deepened his\nhatred.\n\nJayadratha, king of the Sindhu or Indus country, and a friend and ally of\nDuryodhan, came to the woods, and in the absence of the Pandav brothers\ncarried off Draupadi. The Pandavs however pursued the king, chastised him for\nhis misconduct, and rescued Draupadi.\n\nStill more interesting than these various incidents are the tales and legends\nwith which this book is replete. Great saints came to see Yudhishthir in his\nexile, and narrated to him legends of ancient times and of former kings. One\nof these beautiful episodes, the tale of Nala and Damayanti, has been\ntranslated into graceful English verse by Dean Milman, and is known to many\nEnglish readers. The legend of Agastya who drained the ocean dry; of Parasu-\nRama a Brahman who killed the Kshatriyas of the earth; of Bhagiratha who\nbrought down the Ganges from the skies to the earth; of Mann and the universal\ndeluge; of Vishnu and various other gods; of Rama and his deeds which form the\nsubject of the Epic _Ramayana_ ;-these and various other legends have been\ninter woven in the account of the forest-life of the Pandavs, and make it a\nveritable storehouse of ancient Hindu tales and traditions.\n\nAmong these various legends and tales I have selected one which is singular\nand striking. The great truth proclaimed under the thin guise of an eastern\nallegory is that a True Woman\'s Love is not conquered by Death. The story is\nknown by Hindu women high and low, rich and poor, in all parts of India; and\non a certain night in the year millions of Hindu women celebrate a rite in\nhonour of the woman whose love was not conquered by death. Legends like these,\nthough they take away from the unity and conciseness of the Epic, impart a\nmoral instruction to the millions of India the value of which cannot be\noverestimated.\n\nThe portion translated in this Book forms Sections ccxcii. And ccxciii., a\npart of Section ccxciv. and Sections ccxcv. and ccxcvi. of Book iii. of the\noriginal text.\n\n## I\n\n## FOREST LIFE\n\nIn the dark and pathless forest long the Pandav brothers strayed,  \nIn the bosom of the jungle with the fair Draupadi stayed,\n\nAnd they killed the forest red-deer, hewed the gnarled forest wood,  \nFrom the stream she fetched the water, cooked the humble daily food,\n\nIn the morn she swept the cottage, lit the cheerful fire at eve,  \nBut at night in lonesome silence oft her woman\'s heart would grieve,\n\nInsults rankled in her bosom and her tresses were unbound,--  \nSo she vowed,--till fitting vengeance had the base insulters found!\n\nOft when evening\'s shades descended, mantling o\'er the wood and lea,  \nWhen Draupadi by the cottage cooked the food beneath the tree,\n\n_\n\nRishis_ came to good Yudhishthir, sat beside his evening fires,  \nMany olden tales recited, legends of our ancient sires.\n\nMarkandeya, holy _rishi_ , once unto Yudhishthir came,  \nWhen his heart was sorrow-laden with the memories of his shame,\n\n"Pardon, father! " said Yudhishthir, "if unbidden tears will start,  \nBut the woes of fair Draupadi grieve a banished husband\'s heart,\n\nBy her tears the saintly woman broke my bondage worse than death,  \nBy my sins she suffers exile and misfortune\'s freezing breath!\n\nDost thou, sage and saintly _rishi_ , know of wife or woman born,  \nBy such nameless sorrow smitten, by such strange misfortune torn,\n\nHast thou in thy ancient legends heard of true and faithful wife,  \nWith a stronger wif e\'s affection, with a sadder woman\'s life?"\n\n"Listen, monarch!" said the _rishi_ , "to a tale of ancient date,  \nHow Savitri loved and suffered, how she strove and conquered Fate!"\n\n## II\n\n## THE TALE OF SAVITRI\n\nIn the country of fair Madra lived a king in days of old,  \nFaithful to the holy BRAHMA, pure in heart and righteous-souled,\n\nHe was loved in town and country, in the court and hermit\'s den,  \nSacrificer to the bright gods, helper to his brother men,\n\nBut the monarch, Aswapati, son or daughter had he none,  \nOld in years and sunk in anguish, and his days were almost done!\n\nVows he took and holy penance, and with pious rules conformed,  \nSpare in diet as _brahmahari_ many sacred rites performed,\n\nSang the sacred hymn, _savitri_ , to the gods oblations gave,  \nThrough the lifelong day he fasted, uncomplaining, meek and brave!\n\nYear by year he gathered virtue, rose in merit and in might,  \nTill the goddess of savitri smiled upon his sacred rite,\n\nFrom the fire upon the altar which a holy radiance flung,  \nIn the form of beauteous maiden, goddess of _savitri_ sprung!\n\nAnd she spake in gentle accents, blessed the monarch good and brave  \nBlessed his rites and holy penance and a boon unto him gave:\n\n"Penance and thy sacrifices can the Powers Immortal move,  \nAnd the pureness of thy conduct doth thy heart\'s affection prove,\n\nAsk thy boon, king Aswapati, from creation\'s Ancient Sire,  \nTrue to virtue\'s sacred mandate speak thy inmost heart\'s desire."\n\n"For an offspring brave and kingly," so the saintly king replied,  \n"Holy rites and sacrifices and this penance I have tried,\n\nIf these rites and sacrifices move thy favour and thy grace,  \nGrant me offspring, Prayer-Maiden, worthy of my noble race."\n\n"Have thy object," spake the maiden, "Madra\'s pious-hearted king,  \nFrom SWAYMBHU, Self-created, blessings unto thee I bring,\n\nFor HE lists to mortal\'s prayer springing from a heart like thine,  \nAnd HE wills,--a noble daughter grace thy famed and royal line,\n\nAswapati, glad and grateful, take the blessing which I bring,  \nPart in joy and part in silence, bow unto Creation\'s King!"\n\nVanished then the Prayer-Maiden, and the king of noble fame,  \nAswapati, Lord of coursers, to his royal city came,\n\nDays of hope and nights of gladness Madra\'s happy monarch passed,  \nTill his queen of noble offspring gladsome promise gave at last!\n\nAs the moon each night increaseth chasing darksome nightly gloom,  \nGrew the unborn babe in splendour in its happy mother\'s womb,\n\nAnd in fulness of the season came a girl with lotus-eye,  \nFather\'s hope and joy of mother, gift of kindly gods on high!\n\nAnd the king performed its birth-rites with a glad and grateful mind,  \nAnd the people blessed the dear one with their wishes good and kind,\n\nAs _Savitri_ , Prayer-Maiden, had the beauteous offspring given,  \nBrahmans named the child Savitri, holy gift of bounteous Heaven!\n\nGrew the child in brighter beauty like a goddess from above,  \nAnd each passing season added fresher sweetness, deeper love,\n\nCame with youth its lovelier graces, as the buds their leaves unfold,  \nSlender waist and rounded bosom, image as of burnished gold,\n\n_\n\nDeva-Kanya!_ born a goddess, so they said in all the land,  \nPrincely suitors struck with splendour ventured not to seek her hand,\n\nOnce upon a time it happened on a bright and festive day,  \nFresh from bath the beauteous maiden to the altar came to pray,\n\nAnd with cakes and pure libations duly fed the Sacred Flame,  \nThen like SRI in heavenly radiance to her royal father came.\n\nAnd she bowed to him in silence, sacred flowers beside him laid,  \nAnd her hands she folded meekly, sweetly her obeisance made,\n\nWith a father\'s pride, upon her gazed the ruler of the land,  \nBut a strain of sadness lingered, for no suitor claimed her hand.\n\n"Daughter," whispered Aswapati, " now, methinks, the time is come,  \nThou shouldst choose a princely suitor, grace a royal husband\'s home,\n\nChoose thyself a noble husband worthy of thy noble hand,  \nChoose a true and upright monarch, pride and glory of his land,\n\nAs thou choosest, gentle daughter, in thy loving heart\'s desire,  \nBlessing and his free permission will bestow thy happy sire.\n\nFor our sacred _sastras_ sanction, holy Brahmans oft relate,  \nThat the duty-loving father sees his girl in wedded state,\n\nThat the duty-loving husband watches o\'er his consort\'s ways,  \nThat the duty-loving offspring tends his mother\'s widowed days,\n\nTherefore choose a loving husband, daughter of my house and love,  \nSo thy father earn no censure or from men or gods above."\n\nFair Savitri bowed unto him and for parting blessings prayed,  \nThen she left her father\'s palace and in distant regions strayed,\n\nWith her guard and aged courtiers whom her watchful father sent,  \nMounted on her golden chariot unto sylvan woodlands went.\n\nFar in pleasant woods and jungle wandered she from day to day,  \nUnto _asrams_ , hermitages, pious-hearted held her way,\n\nOft she stayed in holy _tirthas_ washed by sacred limpid streams,  \nFood she gave unto the hungry, wealth beyond their fondest dreams.\n\nMany days and months are over, and it once did so befall,  \nWhen the king and _rishi_ Narad sat within the royal hall,\n\nFrom her journeys near and distant and from places known to fame,  \nFair Savitri with the courtiers to her father\'s palace came,\n\nCame and saw her royal father, _rishi_ Narad by his seat,  \nBent her head in salutation, bowed unto their holy feet.\n\n## III\n\n## THE FATED BRIDEGROOM\n\n"Whence comes she," so Narad questioned, "whither was Savitri led,  \nWherefore to a happy husband hath Savitri not been wed?"\n\n"Nay, to choose her lord and husband," so the virtuous monarch said.  \n"Fair Savitri long hath wandered and in holy _tirthas_ stayed,\n\nMaiden! speak unto the _rishi_ , and thy choice and secret tell,"  \nThen a blush suffused her forehead, soft and slow her accents fell!\n\n"Listen, father! Salwa\'s monarch was of old a king of might,  \nRighteous-hearted Dyumat-sena, feeble now and void of sight,\n\nFoemen robbed him of his kingdom when in age he lost his sight,  \nAnd from town and spacious empire was the monarch forced to flight,\n\nWith his queen and with his infant did the feeble monarch stray,  \nAnd the jungle was his palace, darksome was his weary way,\n\nHoly vows assumed the monarch and in penance passed his life,  \nIn the wild woods nursed his infant and with wild fruits fed his wife,\n\nYears have gone in rigid penance, and that child is now a youth,  \nHim I choose my lord and husband, Satyavan, the Soul of Truth!"\n\nThoughtful was the _rishi_ Narad, doleful were the words he said:  \n"Sad disaster waits Savitri if this royal youth she wed,\n\nTruth-beloving is his father, truthful is the royal dame,  \nTruth and virtue rule his actions, Satyavan his sacred name,\n\nSteeds he loved in days of boyhood and to paint them was his joy,  \nHence they called him young Chitraswa, art-beloving gallant boy,\n\nBut O pious-hearted monarch! fair Savitri hath in sooth  \nCourted Fate and sad disaster in that noble gallant youth!\n\nTell me," questioned Aswapati, "for I may not guess thy thought,  \nWherefore is my daughter\'s action with a sad disaster fraught,\n\nIs the youth of noble lustre, gifted in the gifts of art,  \nBlest with wisdom and with prowess, patient in his dauntless heart?\n\n"SURYA\'S lustre in him shineth," so the _rishi_ Narad said,  \n"BRIHASPATI\'S wisdom dwelleth in the youthful prince\'s head,\n\nLike MAHENDRA in his prowess, and in patience like the Earth,  \nYet O king! a sad disaster marks the gentle youth from birth!\n\n"Tell me, _rishi_ , then thy reason," so the anxious monarch cried,  \n"Why to youth so great and gifted may this maid be not allied,\n\nIs he princely in his bounty, gentle-hearted in his grace,  \nDuly versed in sacred knowledge, fair in mind and fair in face?\n\n"Free in gifts like Rantideva," so the holy _rishi_ said,  \n"Versed in lore like monarch Sivi who all ancient monarchs led,\n\nLike Yayati open-hearted and like CHANDRA in his grace,  \nLike the handsome heavenly ASVINS fair and radiant in his face,\n\nMeek and graced with patient virtue he controls his noble mind,  \nModest in his kindly actions, true to friends and ever kind,\n\nAnd the hermits of the forest praise him for his righteous truth,  \nNathless, king, thy daughter may not wed this noble-hearted youth!\n\n"Tell me, _rishi_ ," said the monarch, "for thy sense from me is hid,  \nHas this prince some fatal blemish, wherefore is this match forbid?"\n\n"Fatal fault!" exclaimed the _rishi_ , "fault that wipeth all his grace,  \nFault that human power nor effort, rite nor penance can efface,\n\nFatal fault or destined sorrow! for it is decreed on high,  \nOn this day, a twelve-month later, this ill-fated prince will die!"\n\nShook the startled king in terror and in fear and trembling cried:  \n"Unto short-lived, fated bridegroom ne\'er my child shall be allied,\n\nCome, Savitri, dear-loved maiden, choose another happier lord,  \n_Rishi_ Narad speaketh wisdom, list unto his holy word!\n\nEvery grace and every virtue is effaced by cruel Fate,  \nOn this day, a twelve-month later, leaves the prince his mortal state!"\n\n"Father!" answered thus the maiden, soft and sad her accents fell,  \n"I have heard thy honoured mandate, holy Narad counsels well,\n\n_\n\nPardon witless maiden\'s fancy, but beneath the eye of Heaven,  \nOnly once a maiden chooseth, twice her troth may not be given,\n\nLong his life or be it narrow, and his virtues great or none,  \nSatyavan is still my husband, he my heart and troth hath won,\n\nWhat a maiden\'s heart hath chosen that a maiden\'s lips confess,  \nTrue to him thy poor Savitri goes into the wilderness!"\n\n_\n\n"Monarch!" uttered then the _rishi_ , "fixed is she in mind and heart,  \nFrom her troth the true Savitri never, never will depart,\n\nMore than mortal\'s share of virtue unto Satyavan is given,  \nLet the true maid wed her chosen, leave the rest to gracious Heaven!"\n\n" _Rishi_ and preceptor holy!" so the weeping monarch prayed,  \n"Heaven avert all future evils, and thy mandate is obeyed!"\n\nNarad wished him joy and gladness, blessed the loving youth and maid,  \nForest hermits on their wedding every fervent blessing laid.\n\n## IV\n\n## OVERTAKEN BY FATE\n\nTwelve-month in the darksome forest by her true and chosen lord,  \nSweet Savitri served his parents by her thought and deed and word,\n\nBark of tree supplied her garments draped upon her bosom fair,  \nOr the red cloth as in _asrams_ holy women love to wear.\n\nAnd the aged queen she tended with a fond and filial pride,  \nServed the old and sightless monarch like a daughter by his side,\n\nAnd with love and gentle sweetness pleased her husband and her lord,  \nBut in secret, night and morning, pondered still on Narad\'s word!\n\nNearer came the fatal morning by the holy Narad told,  \nFair Savitri reckoned daily and her heart was still and cold,\n\nThree short days remaining only! and she took a vow severe  \nOf _triratra_ , three nights\' penance, holy fasts and vigils drear.\n\nOf Savitri\'s rigid penance heard the king with anxious woe,  \nSpake to her in loving accents, so the vow she might forgo:\n\n"Hard the penance, gentle daughter, and thy woman\'s limbs are frail,  \nAfter three nights\' fasts and vigils sure thy tender health may fail,"\n\n"Be not anxious, loving father," meekly this Savitri prayed,  \n"Penance I have undertaken, will unto the gods be made."\n\nMuch misdoubting then the monarch gave his sad and slow assent.  \nPale with fast and unseen tear-drops, lonesome nights Savitri spent,\n\nNearer came the fatal morning, and to-morrow he shall die,  \nDark, lone hours of nightly silence! Tearless, sleepless is her eye!\n\nDawns that dread and fated morning! " said Savitri, bloodless, brave,  \nPrayed her fervent prayers in silence, to the Fire oblations gave,\n\nBowed unto the forest Brahmans, to the parents kind and good,  \nJoined her hands in salutation and in reverent silence stood.\n\nWith the usual morning blessing, " _Widow may\'st thou never be_ ,"  \nAnchorites and aged Brahmans blessed Savitri fervently,\n\nO! that blessing fell upon her like the rain on thirsty air,  \nStruggling hope inspired her bosom as she drank those accents fair,\n\nBut returned the dark remembrance of the _rishi_ Narad\'s word,  \nPale she watched the creeping sunbeams, mused upon. her fated lord!\n\n"Daughter, now thy fast is over," so the loving parents said,  \n"Take thy diet after penance, for thy morning prayers are prayed,"\n\n"Pardon, father," said Savitri, "let this other day be done,"  \nUnshed tear-drops filled her eyelids, glistened in the morning sun!\n\nSatyavan, sedate and stately, ponderous axe on shoulder hung,  \nFor the distant darksome jungle issued forth serene and strong,\n\nBut unto him came Savitri and in sweetest accents prayed,  \nAs upon his manly bosom gently she her forehead laid:\n\n"Long I wished to see the jungle where steals not the solar ray,  \nTake me to the darksome forest, husband, let me go to-day!"\n\n"Come not, love," he sweetly answered with a loving husband\'s care,  \n"Thou art all unused to labour, forest paths thou may\'st not dare,\n\nAnd with recent fasts and vigils pale and bloodless is thy face,  \nAnd thy steps are weak and feeble, jungle paths thou may\'st not trace."\n\n"Fasts and vigils make me stronger," said the wife with wifely pride,  \n"Toil I shall not feel nor languor when my lord is by my side,\n\nFor I feel a woman\'s longing with my lord to trace the way,  \nGrant me, husband ever gracious, with thee let me go to-day!\n\nAnswered then the loving husband, as his hands in hers he wove,  \n"Ask permission from my parents in the trackless woods to rove,"\n\nThen Savitri to the monarch urged her longing strange request,  \nAfter duteous salutation thus her humble prayer addrest.\n\n"To the jungle goes my husband, fuel and the fruit to seek,  \nI would follow if my mother and my loving father speak,\n\nTwelve-month from this narrow _ashram_ hath Savitri stepped nor strayed,  \nIn this cottage true and faithful ever hath Savitri stayed,\n\nFor the sacrificial fuel wends my lord his lonesome way,  \nPlease my kind and loving parents, I would follow him to-day."\n\n"Never since her wedding morning," so the loving king replied,  \n"Wish or thought Savitri whispered, for a boon or object sighed,\n\nDaughter, thy request is granted, safely in the forest roam,  \nSafely with thy lord and husband seek again thy cottage home."\n\nBowing to her loving parents did the fair Savitri part,  \nSmile upon her pallid features, anguish in her inmost heart,\n\nRound her sylvan greenwoods blossomed \'neath a cloudless Indian sky,  \nFlocks of pea-fowls gorgeous plumaged flew before her wondering eye,\n\nWoodland rills and crystal nullahs gently roll\'d o\'er rocky bed,  \nFlower-decked hills in dewy brightness towering glittered overhead,\n\nBirds of song and beauteous feather trilled a note in every grove,  \nSweeter accents fell upon her, from her husband\'s lips of love!\n\nStill with thoughtful eye Savitri watched her dear and fated lord,  \nFlail of grief was in her bosom but her pale lips shaped no word,\n\nAnd she listened to her husband still on anxious thought intent,  \nCleft in two her throbbing bosom as in silence still she went!\n\nGaily with the gathered wild-fruits did the prince his basket fill,  \nHewed the interlaced branches with his might and practised skill,\n\nTill the drops stood on his forehead, weary was his aching head,  \nFaint he came unto Savitri and in faltering accents said:\n\nCruel ache is on my forehead, fond and ever faithful wife,  \nAnd I feel a hundred needles pierce me and torment my life,\n\nAnd my feeble footsteps falter and my senses seem to reel,  \nFain would I beside thee linger for a sleep doth o\'er me steal."\n\nWith a wild and speechless terror pale Savitri held her lord,  \nOn her lap his head she rested as she laid him on the sward,\n\nNarad\'s fatal words remembered as she watched her husband\'s head,  \nBurning lip and pallid forehead and the dark and creeping shade,\n\nClasped him in her beating bosom, kissed his lips with panting breath,  \nDarker grew the lonesome forest, and he slept the sleep of death!\n\n## V\n\n## TRIUMPH OVER FATE\n\nIn the bosom of the shadows rose a Vision dark and dread,  \nShape of gloom in inky garment and a crown was on his head,\n\nGleaming Form of sable splendour, blood-red was his sparkling eye,  \nAnd a fatal noose he carried, grim and godlike, dark and high!\n\nAnd he stood in solemn silence, looked in silence on the dead,  \nAnd Savitri on the greensward gently placed her husband\'s head,\n\nAnd a tremor shook Savitri, but a woman\'s love is strong,  \nWith her hands upon her bosom thus she spake with quivering tongue;\n\nMore than mortal is thy glory! If a radiant god thou be,  \nTell me what bright name thou bearest, what thy message unto me."\n\n"Know me," thus responded YAMA, " mighty monarch of the dead,  \nMortals leaving earthly mansion to my darksome realms are led,\n\nSince with woman\'s full affection thou hast loved thy husband dear,  \nHence before thee, faithful woman, YAMA doth in form appear,\n\nBut his days and loves are ended, and he leaves his faithful wife,  \nIn this noose I bind and carry spark of his immortal life,\n\nVirtue graced his life and action, spotless was his princely heart,  \nHence for him I came in person, princess, let thy husband part."\n\nYAMA from the prince\'s body, pale and bloodless, cold and dumb,  \nDrew the vital spark, _purusha_ , smaller than the human thumb,\n\nIn his noose the spark he fastened, silent went his darksome way,  \nLeft the body shorn of lustre to its rigid cold decay,\n\nSouthward went the dark-hued YAMA with the youth\'s immortal life,  \nAnd, for woman\'s love abideth, followed still the faithful wife.\n\n"Turn, Savitri," outspake YAMA, "for thy husband loved and lost,  \nDo the rites due unto mortals by their Fate predestined crost,\n\nFor thy wifely duty ceases, follow not in fruitless woe,  \nAnd no farther living creature may with monarch YAMA go\n\nBut I may not choose but follow where thou takest my husband\'s life,  \nFor Eternal Law divides not loving man and faithful wife,\n\nFor a woman\'s true affection, for a woman\'s sacred woe,  \nGrant me in thy godlike mercy farther still with him I go!\n\nFourfold are our human duties: first to study holy lore,  \nThen to live as good householders, feed the hungry at our door,\n\nThen to pass our days in penance, last to fix our thoughts above,  \nBut the final goal of virtue, it is Truth and deathless Love!"\n\n"True and holy are thy precepts," listening YAMA made reply,  \n"And they fill my heart with gladness and with pious purpose high,\n\nI would bless thee, fair Savitri, but the dead come not to life,  \nAsk for other boon and blessing, faithful, true and virtuous wife!"\n\n"Since you so permit me, YAMA," so the good Savitri said,  \n"For my husband\'s banished father let my dearest suit be made,\n\nSightless in the darksome forest dwells the monarch faint and weak  \nGrant him sight and grant him vigour, YAMA, in thy mercy speak!\n\nDuteous daughter," YAMA answered, "be thy pious wishes given,  \nAnd his eyes shall be restored to the cheerful light of heaven,\n\nTurn, Savitri, faint and weary, follow not in fruitless woe,  \nAnd no farther living creature may with monarch YAMA go!"\n\n"Faint nor weary is Savitri," so the noble princess said,  \n"Since she waits upon her husband, gracious Monarch of the dead,\n\nWhat befalls the wedded husband still befalls the faithful wife,  \nWhere he leads she ever follows, be it death or be it life!\n\nAnd our sacred writ ordaineth and our pious _rishis_ sing\'  \nTransient meeting with the holy cloth its countless blessings bring,\n\nLonger friendship with the holy purifies the mortal birth,  \nLasting union with the holy is the bright sky on the earth,\n\nUnion with the pure and holy is immortal heavenly life,  \nFor Eternal Law divides not loving man and faithful wife!"\n\n"Blessed are thy words," said YAMA, "blessed is thy pious thought,  \nWith a higher purer wisdom are thy holy lessons fraught,\n\nI would bless thee, fair Savitri, but the dead come not to life,  \nAsk for other boon and blessing, faithful, true and virtuous wife!"\n\n"Since you so permit me, YAMA," so the good Savitri said,  \nOnce more for my husband\'s father be my supplication made,\n\nLost his kingdom, in the forest dwells the monarch faint and weak,  \nGrant him back his wealth and kingdom,Y AMA, in thy mercy speak!"\n\nLoving daughter," YAMA answered, " wealth and kingdom I bestow,  \nTurn, Savitri, living mortal may not with King YAMA go!"\n\nStill Savitri, meek and faithful, followed her departed lord,  \nYAMA still with higher wisdom listened to her saintly word,\n\nAnd the Sable King was vanquished, and he turned on her again,  \nAnd his words fell on Savitri like the cooling summer rain,\n\nNoble woman, speak thy wishes, name thy boon and purpose high,  \nWhat the pious mortal asketh gods in heaven may not deny!"\n\nThou hast," so Savitri answered, " granted father\'s realm and might,  \nTo his vain and sightless eyeballs hast restored their blessed sight,\n\nGrant him that the line of monarchs may not all untimely end,  \nSatya,van may see his kingdom to his royal sons descend!"\n\n"Have thy object," answered YAMA, "and thy lord shall live again,  \nHe shall live to be a father, and his children too shall reign,\n\nF or a woman\'s troth abideth longer that the fleeting breath,  \nAnd a woman\'s love abideth higher than the doom of Death!"\n\n## VI\n\n## RETURN HOME\n\nVanished then the Sable Monarch, and Savitri held her way  \nWhere in dense and darksome forest still her husband lifeless lay,\n\nAnd she sat upon the greensward by the cold unconscious dead,  \nOn her lap with deeper kindness placed her consort\'s lifeless head,\n\nAnd that touch of true affection thrilled him back to waking life,  \nAs returned from distant regions gazed the prince upon his wife,\n\n"Have I lain too long and slumbered, sweet Savitri, faithful spouse,  \nBut I dreamt a Sable Person took me in a fatal noose!"\n\n"Pillowed on this lap," she answered, "long upon the earth you lay,  \nAnd the Sable Person, husband, he hath come and passed away,\n\nRise and leave this darksome forest if thou feelest light and strong,  \nThe night is on the jungle and our way is dark and long."\n\nRising as from happy slumber looked the young prince on all around,  \nSaw the wide-extending jungle mantling all the darksome ground,\n\n"Yes," he said, "I now remember, ever loving faithful dame,  \nWe in search of fruit and fuel to this lonesome forest came,\n\nAs I hewed the gnarled branches, cruel anguish filled my brain,  \nAnd I laid me on the greensward with a throbbing piercing pain,\n\nPillowed on thy gentle bosom, solaced by thy gentle love,  \nI was soothed, and drowsy slumber fell on me from skies above.\n\nAll was dark and then I witnessed, was it but a fleeting dream,  \nGod or Vision, dark and dreadful, in the deepening shadows gleam,\n\nWas this dream my fair Savitri, dost thou of this Vision know,  \nTell me, for before my eyesight still the Vision seems to glow!"\n\n"Darkness thickens," said Savitri, "and the evening waxeth late,  \nWhen the morrow\'s light returneth I shall all these scenes narrate,\n\nNow arise, for darkness gathers, deeper grows the gloomy night,  \nAnd thy loving anxious parents trembling wait thy welcome sight,\n\nHark the rangers of the forest! how their voices strike the ear,  \nProwlers of the darksome jungle! how they fill my breast with fear!\n\nForest-fire is raging yonder, for I see a distant gleam,  \nAnd the rising evening breezes help the red and radiant beam,\n\nLet me fetch a burning faggot and prepare a friendly fight,  \nWith these fallen withered branches chase the shadows of the night,\n\nAnd if feeble still thy footsteps,--long and weary is our way,--  \nBy the fire repose, my husband, and return by light of day."\n\n"For my parents, fondly anxious," Satyavan thus made reply,  \n"Pains my heart and yearns my bosom, let us to their cottage hie,\n\nWhen I tarried in the jungle or by day or dewy eve,  \nSearching in the hermitages often did my parents grieve,\n\nAnd with father\'s soft reproaches and with mother\'s loving fears,  \nChid me for my tardy footsteps, dewed me with their gentle tears.\n\nThink then of my father\'s sorrow, of my mother\'s woeful plight,  \nIf afar in wood and jungle pass we now the livelong night,\n\nWife beloved, I may not fathom what mishap or load of care,  \nUnknown dangers, unseen sorrows, even now my parents share!"\n\nGentle drops of filial sorrow trickled down his manly eye,  \nPond Savitri sweetly speaking softly wiped the tear-drops dry:\n\n"Trust me, husband, if Savitri hath been faithful in her love,  \nIf she hath with pious offerings served the righteous gods above,\n\nIf she hath a sister\'s kindness unto brother men performed,  \nIf she hath in speech and action unto holy truth conformed,\n\nUnknown blessings, mighty gladness, trust thy ever faithful wife,  \nAnd not sorrows or disasters wait this eve our parents\' life!"\n\nThen she rose and tied her tresses, gently helped her lord to rise,  \nWalked with him the pathless jungle, looked with love into his eyes,\n\nOn her neck his clasping left arm sweetly winds in soft embrace,  \nRound his waist Savitri\'s right arm doth sweetly interlace,\n\nThus they walked the darksome jungle, silent stars looked from above,  \nAnd the hushed and throbbing midnight watched Savitri\'s deathless love.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book VI:
