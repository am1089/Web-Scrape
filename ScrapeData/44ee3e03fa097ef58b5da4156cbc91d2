'A diver-bird (Madgu, meant for Pra _n_ a) will declare to you another\nfoot of Brahman.'\n\n(After these words of the Ha _m_ sa), Satyakama, on the morrow, drove the cows\nonward. And when they came towards the evening, he lighted a fire, penned the\ncows, laid wood on the fire, and sat down behind the fire, looking toward the\neast.\n\n2\\. Then a diver flew near and said to him 'Satyakama.' He replied: 'Sir.'\n\n3\\. The diver said: 'Friend, I will declare unto you one foot of Brahman!\n\n'Declare it, Sir,' he replied.\n\nHe said to him: 'Breath is one quarter, the eye is one quarter, the ear is one\nquarter, the mind is one quarter. This is a foot of Brahman, consisting of\nfour quarters, and called \xc3\x82yatanavat (having a home).\n\n'He who knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting of four\nquarters, by the name of \xc3\x82yatanavat, becomes possessed of a home in this\nworld. He conquers the worlds which offer a home, whoever knows this and\nmeditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting of four quarters, by the name of\n\xc3\x82yatanavat.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 9](sbe01086.htm)\n\n"
