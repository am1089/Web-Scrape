The gods and men divided the\nquarters, the gods (obtained) the eastern, the Pitrs the southern, men the\nwestern, the Rudras the northern. In that he makes a hall with beams pointing\neast, the sacrificer approaches the world of the gods. He covers it over, for\nthe world of the gods is hidden from the world of men. \'It is not easy\', they\nsay, \'to go from this world; for who knows if he is in yonder world or not.\'\nHe makes at the corners apertures [1], for the winning of both worlds. He\nshaves his hair and beard, he trims his nails. The hair and the beard are dead\nand impure skin, and by thus destroying the dead and impure skin he becomes\nfit for the sacrifice and approaches the sacrifice. The Angirases going to the\nworld of heaven placed in the waters consecration and penance. He bathes in\nthe waters; verily visibly he secures consecration and penance. He bathes at a\nford, for at a ford did they place (consecration and penance); he bathes at a\nford [2]; verily he becomes a ford for his fellows. He sips water; verily he\nbecomes pure within. He consecrates him with a garment; the linen garment has\nSoma for its deity. He who consecrates himself approaches Soma as his deity.\nHe says, \'Thou art the body of Soma; guard my body.\' He approaches his own\ndeity; verily also he invokes this blessing. (Of the garment) the place where\nthe border is belongs to Agni, the wind-guard to Vayu, the fringe to the\nPitrs, the foreedge to the plants [3], the warp to the Adityas, the woof to\nthe All-gods, the meshes to the Naksatras. The garment is thus connected with\nall the gods; in that he consecrates him with the garment, verily with all the\ngods he consecrates him. Man has breath without; his eating is his breath, he\neats; verily he consecrates himself with breath. He becomes satiated. As great\nas is his breath, with it he approaches the sacrifice. Ghee pertains to the\ngods, sour cream to the Pitrs, well-seasoned butter to men [4], fresh butter\nis connected with all the gods; verily in anointing with fresh butter he\nsatisfies all the gods. The man who is consecrated has fallen from this world\nand yet not gone to the world of the gods; fresh butter is as it were midway;\ntherefore he anoints with fresh butter, along the hair, with a Yajus, for\ndestruction. Indra slew Vrtra; his eyeball fell away; it became collyrium.\nWhen he anoints, verily he takes away the eye of his enemy. He anoints his\nright eye first [5], for men anoint the left first. He does not rub (the\nointment) on, for men rub (the ointment) on. Five times he anoints; the Pankti\nhas five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he obtains the\nsacrifice. He anoints a limited number of times, for men anoint an unlimited\nnumber of times. He anoints with (a stalk) which has a tuft, for men anoint\nwith (a stalk) which has no tuft; (verily he anoints them) for discrimination.\nIf he were to anoint with (a stalk) having no tuft, he would be as it were a\nthunder bolt. He anoints with one which has a tuft, for friendship [6]. Indra\nslew Vrtra, he died upon the waters. Of the waters what was fit for sacrifice,\npure, and divine, that went out of the waters, and became Darbha grass. In\nthat he purifies (the sacrificer) with bunches of Darbha grass, verily he\npurifies him with the waters which are fit for sacrifice, pure, and divine. He\npurifies (him) with two (stalks); verily he purifies him by days and nights.\nHe purifies (him) with three (stalks); three are these worlds; verily he\npurifies him by these worlds. He purifies (him) with five stalks [7]; the\nPankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he purifies him\nby the sacrifice. He purifies (him) with six (stalks); six are the seasons;\nverily he purifies him by the seasons. He purifies (him) with seven (stalks);\nseven are the metres; verily he purifies him by the metres. He purifies (him)\nwith nine (stalks); nine are the breaths in man; verily he purifies him along\nwith his breaths. He purifies (him) with twenty-one (stalks); there are ten\nfingers and ten toes, and the body is the twenty first; he thus completely\npurifies the man [8]. He says, \'Let the lord of thought purify thee\'; the mind\nis the lord of thought; verily by the mind he purifies him. He says, \'Let the\nlord of speech purify thee\'; verily by speech he purifies him. He says, \'Let\nthe god Savitr purify thee\'; verily being instigated by Savitr, he purifies\nhim. He says, \'O lord of the purifier, with thy purifier, for whatsoever I\npurify myself, that may I have strength to accomplish.\' Verily does he invoke\nthis blessing.\n\n### vi. 1. 2.\n\nAll the gods who purified themselves for the sacrifice waxed great. He who\nknowing thus purifies himself for the sacrifice waxes great. Having purified\nhim without he makes him go within. Verily having purified him in the world of\nmen, he leads him forward purified to the world of the gods. \'He is not\nconsecrated by one oblation \', they say; verily he offers four with the\ndipping-ladle for consecration; the fifth he offers with the offering-ladle;\nthe Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the\nsacrifice. \'To the purpose, to the impulse, to Agni, [1] hail!\' he says, for\nwith purpose does a man employ the sacrifice, planning to sacrifice. \'To\nwisdom, to thought, to Agni, hail!\' he says, for by wisdom and thought man\napproaches the sacrifice. \'To Sarasvati, to Pusan, to Agni, hail! \'he says.\nSarasvati is speech, Pusan the earth;. verily with speech and the earth he\nperforms the sacrifice. \'O ye divine, vast, all-soothing waters\', he says. The\nwaters of the rain [2] are the divine, vast, all-soothing waters; if he said\nnot that praise, the divine waters would descend in anger on this world. He\nsays, \'O ye divine, vast, all-soothing waters.\' Verily he makes them soothing\nfor this world; accordingly being soothed they approach this world. \'Heaven\nand earth\', he says, for the sacrifice is in heaven and earth. \'Wide\natmosphere\', he says, for the sacrifice is in the atmosphere. \'May Brhaspati\nrejoice in our oblation\' [3], he says. Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman)\nof the gods; verily by the holy power he wins this sacrifice for him. If he\nwere to say _vidheh_ then he would stumble on the sacrificial post; he says\n_vrdhatu_ ; verily he avoids the sacrificial post. Prajapati created the\nsacrifice. Being created it went away. It crushed the Yajus, it crushed the\nSaman; the Rc raised it; in that the Rc raised (it), hence the elevating\noffering has the name. With a Rc [4] he sacrifices, to support the sacrifice.\n\'It was the Anustubh among the metres which supported it\', they say. Therefore\nhe sacrifices with an Anustubh, to support the sacrifice. \'It was the twelve\n"calf-binders" which supported it\', they say. Therefore with twelve those who\nknow the \'calf-binders\', consecrate. This Rc is an Anustubh; the Anustubh is\nspeech; in that he consecrates him with this Rc, he consecrates him with the\nwhole of speech. \'Let every (man) of the god who leads \', he says. By that\n(the Rc) is connected with Savitr. \'(Let every) man choose the companionship\'\n[5], he says. By that (the Rc) has the Pitrs for its deity.\' \'Every man\nprayeth for wealth\', he says. By that (the Rc) is connected with the All-gods.\n\'Let him choose glory that he may prosper\', he says. By that (the Rc) is\nconnected with Pusan. This Rc indeed is connected with all the gods. In that\nhe consecrates with this Rc, he consecrates him with all the gods. The first\nquarter-verse is of seven syllables; the other three are of eight syllables.\nThe three approach the eight; the four the eight. Because it has eight\nsyllables [6] it is a Gayatri. Because it has eleven syllables it is a\nTristubh. Because it has twelve syllables, it is a Jagati. This Rc indeed is\nall the metres. In that he consecrates him with this Rc, he consecrates him\nwith all the metres. The first quarter verse is of seven syllables; the\n\xc3\x87akvari is of seven syllables, the \xc3\x87akvari is cattle; verily he wins cattle.\nThe first quarter-verse is defective by one syllable. Therefore men live on\nwhat of speech is defective. He offers with a full (verse) to win Prajapati;\nfull as it were is Prajapati. He offers with a defective (verse), for the\ncreation of offspring, for from what is defective Prajapati created offspring.\n\n### vi. 1. 3.\n\nThe Rc and the Saman, unwilling to remain with the gods for the sacrifice,\ntaking the form of a black antelope departed and remained away. The (gods)\nreflected, \'He whom they shall resort to will become all this world.\' They\ncalled to them, and they depositing their might in day and night came up to\nthem. This is the colour of the Rc, the white of the skin of the black\nantelope; the black is the colour of the Saman. \'Ye are images of the Rc and\nSaman\', he says; verily he wins the Rc and the Saman [1]. The white of the\nblack antelope skin is the colour of the day, the black of the night. Whatever\nis imbued in those two, he wins. He consecrates (him) with a black antelope\nskin. The black antelope skin is the form of the holy power; verily he\nconsecrates him with the holy power. \'O god, this prayer of him who\nimploreth\', he says. That is according to the text. The man who is consecrated\nis a foetus; the clothing is the caul; be covers. Therefore [2] foetuses are\nborn covered (with the caul). He should not uncover before the purchasing of\nthe Soma. If he were to uncover before the purchasing of the Soma, the\nfoetuses of offspring would be liable to miscarriage. He uncovers when the\nSoma has been purchased; verily he is born. It is also as when one uncovers to\na superior. The Angirases going to the world of heaven divided their strength.\nWhat was left over became \xc3\x87ara grass; \xc3\x87ara grass is strength. In that the\ngirdle is of \xc3\x87ara grass [3], he wins strength. He girds it in the middle;\nverily he gives him strength in the middle. Therefore in the middle men enjoy\nstrength. The part of man above the navel is pure, that below is impure. In\nthat he girds him in the middle he discriminates between the pure and impure\nparts. Indra hurled his thunderbolt against Vrtra; it divided into three\nparts; one-third the wooden sword, one-third the chariot, and one-third the\nsacrificial post [4]. The internal arrows which were split ( _a \xc3\xa7iryanta_)\nbecame \xc3\x87ara grass, and that is why \xc3\x87ara grass is so called. The thunderbolt is\n\xc3\x87ara grass; hunger indeed is the foe of man. In that the girdle is of \xc3\x87ara\ngrass, he clearly drives away the enemy hunger from the middle (of man\'s\nbody). It is threefold. The breath is threefold; verily he places the\nthreefold breath in the middle of the sacrificer. It is broad, for the\ndiscrimination of the strands. He consecrates the sacrificer with a girdle,\nwith a yoke his wife, for the sake of offspring [5]. The sacrifice reflected\non the gift (to the priests). He had intercourse with her. Indra perceived\nthis and reflected, \'He who will be born from this union will be this world.\'\nHe entered her; from her verily was Indra born; he reflected, \'He who hence\nother than I will be born will be this world\'. Stroking her womb he split it,\nshe became barren after birth, and that is the origin of the (cow) which is\nbarren after birth [6]. He wrapped it (the _yoni_ ) in his hand, he deposited\nit among the wild beasts, it became the horn of the black antelope. \'Thou art\nthe birthplace of Indra; harm me not\', (with these words) he hands the horn of\nthe black antelope. Verily he makes the sacrifice united with the womb, the\ngift with the womb, Indra with the womb, for union with the womb. \'For\nploughing thee, for good crops\', he says. Therefore plants grow up without\nploughing. \'For those of good fruits thee, for the plants\', he says. Therefore\nplants bear fruit. If he were to scratch himself with his hand [7] his\noffspring would be liable to the itch; if he were to smile, they would become\nnaked. He scratches himself with the horn of the black antelope and smiles,\nholding it for the protection of his offspring. He should not let go the horn\nof the black antelope before the bringing of the gifts (to the priests). If he\nwere to let go the horn of the black antelope before the bringing of the\ngifts, the womb of his offspring will be liable to miscarriage. When the gifts\nhave been brought, he casts away the horn of the black antelope in the pit.\nThe pit is the womb of the sacrificer; the horn of the black antelope is the\nwomb; verily he places womb in womb, that the sacrificer may have a womb.\n\n### vi. 1. 4.\n\nSpeech went away from the gods, not being willing to serve for the sacrifice.\nShe entered the trees. It is the voice of the trees, the voice that is heard\nin the drum, the lute, and the flute. In that he offers the staff of the\ninitiated, he wins speech. The (staff) is of Udumbara wood; the, Udumbara is\nstrength; verily he wins strength. It is level with his mouth; verily from the\nmouth (downwards) he wins strength for him. Therefore from the mouth they\nenjoy strength [1]. After the buying of the Soma he hands the staff to the\nMaitravaruna (priest). For the Maitravaruna first assigns to the priests their\nutterance, and the priests plant it in the sacrificer. \'Hail! with my mind the\nsacrifice\', he says; for man approaches the sacrifice with his mind. \'Hail!\nfrom heaven and earth\', he says; for the sacrifice is in heaven and earth.\n\'Hail! from the broad atmosphere\', he says; for the sacrifice is in the\natmosphere. \'Hail! from the wind the sacrifice I grasp\', he says [2]. The\nsacrifice is he who blows here; verily he clearly wins him. He clenches his\nfist; he restrains his speech, for the support of the sacrifice. \'This Brahman\nhas consecrated himself\', he says thrice in a whisper; verily he proclaims him\nto the gods. Thrice aloud (he says it); verily he proclaims him to both gods\nand men. He should not utter speech until the Naksatras appear. If he were to\nutter speech before the Naksatras appear, he would divide the sacrifice [3].\nWhen the Naksatras have arisen, be utters speech, \'Prepare the fast food.\' The\nconsecrated is bound by a vow of sacrifice; verily with regard to the\nsacrifice does he utter speech. Should he utter speech, he should then repeat\na Rc addressed to Visnu. Visnu is the sacrifice; verily he unites the\nsacrifice with the sacrifice. \'The thought divine we meditate\', he says. Thus\nhe makes smooth the sacrifice. \'May it guide us safely according as we will\',\nhe says. Verily he wins the dawn [4]. The theologians say, \'Should an offering\nbe made in the house of one who is consecrated, or should an offering not be\nmade?\' The man who is consecrated is the oblation, and if he were to sacrifice\nhe would offer a part of the sacrificer; if he were not to sacrifice, then he\nwould omit a joint of the sacrifice. \'The gods, mind born, mind using\', he\nsays. The gods, mind born, mind using, are the breaths; verily in them he\nsacrifices secretly, and the sacrifice is both offered as it were and yet not\noffered. Now the Raksases are fain to hurt him who is consecrated while he\nsleeps. Agni [5] indeed is the slayer of the Raksases. \'O Agni, be thou\nwakeful. Let us be glad\', he says; verily having made Agni his guardian, for\nthe smiting away of the Raksases, he sleeps. Now, if a man who is consecrated\nsleeps, he does something that as it were is contrary to his vow. I Thou, O\nAgni, art the guardian of vows\', he says. Agni indeed is among the gods the\nguardian of vows; verily he causes him to take up his vow again. \'Among the\ngods and men\', he says for he, being a god [6], is (guardian of vows) among\nmen. \'Thou art to be invoked at our sacrifices\', he says; for him they invoke\nat the sacrifices. Now power and the gods depart from the man who is\nconsecrated when he is asleep. \'All the gods have surrounded me\', he says;\nverily he unites him with both power and the gods. If he were not to utter\nthat formula (Yajus), so many cattle would be as he might consecrate himself\nfor. \'O Soma, give so much [7] and bear more hither\', he says; verily he\nobtains innumerable cattle. \'Thou art gold; be for my enjoyment\', he says;\nverily he takes each according to its deity. He says, \'To Vayu thee, to Varuna\nthee!\' If he did not so specify them, he would put the gifts out of\ncorrespondence with the deities, and would be brought low to the deities.\nBecause he thus specifies them, he puts the gifts in correspondence with the\ndeities, and is not brought low to the deities. \'O divine waters, son of the\nwaters\', he says. \'That divine part of yours, which is pure and fit for the\nsacrifice, may I not step upon\', that he says in effect. \'The unbroken web of\nearth may I follow\', he says; verily making a bridge he crosses over.\n\n### vi. 1. 5.\n\nThe gods, having fixed up a place of sacrifice, could not distinguish the\nquarters. They ran up to one another, (saying) \'By thee shall we distinguish\nthem, by thee.\' They fixed upon Aditi, (saying, \'By thee shall we distinguish\nthem.\' She said, \'Let me choose a guerdon. Let the opening oblation in the\nsacrifice be mine, and the concluding oblation be mine.\' Therefore the opening\noblation of the sacrifice belongs to Aditi, and the concluding oblation\nbelongs to Aditi. He offers to five gods; there are five quarters, (and so it\nserves) for the distinction of the quarters [1]. Now the Pankti is of five\nelements, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice. They made\nsacrifice to Pathya Svasti. The eastern quarter they distinguished by her, by\nAgni the southern, by Soma the western, by Savitr the northern, by Aditi the\nzenith. He offers to Pathya Svasti; verily he distinguishes the eastern\nquarter. Having offered to Pathya Svasti, he offers to Agni and Soma. Agni and\nSoma indeed are the eyes of the sacrificer; verily he sees with them [2].\nHaving offered to Agni and Soma, he offers to Savitr; verily on the\ninstigation of Savitr he sees. Having offered to Savitr, he offers to Aditi;\nAditi indeed is this (earth); verily taking his stand on it he sees. Having\noffered to Aditi, he repeats the verse to the Maruts. The Maruts are the\nsubjects of the gods. As the subjects of the gods are in harmony, so he brings\nthe human subjects into harmony.\' In that he repeats the verse to the Maruts,\nit is to bring subjects into harmony. The theologians say, \'The opening\noblation should be performed with a fore-offering, but without an after-\noffering; the concluding oblation should be performed with all after-offering\n[3], but without a fore-offering.\' These are the fore-offerings, and these the\nafter-offerings, and this is the course of the sacrifice. This is not to be\nfollowed. The fore-offerings are the self; the after-offerings the offspring.\nIf he were to omit the fore-offerings, he would omit the self; if he were to\nomits the after-offerings, he would omit offspring. In so far as the whole of\nthe sacrifice is not performed, in so far does the sacrifice come to ruin, and\nthe sacrificer comes to ruin along with the sacrifice [4]. Verily the opening\noblation should be performed with both fore- and after-offerings, and the\nconcluding oblation should be performed both with fore- and after offerings.\nHe does not omit the self, nor offspring; the sacrifice does not come to ruin,\nnor the sacrificer. He offers the concluding oblation in the scrapings of the\nopening oblation; this is the course of the sacrifice. Now if he were to make\nthe Yajya verses of the opening libation the Yajya verses of the concluding\nlibation, he would mount to the other world away from this, and would be\nliable to die. The Puronuvakya verses of the opening libation should be made\nthe Yajya verses of the concluding libation; verily he finds support in this\nworld.\n\n### vi. 1. 6.\n\nKadru and Suparni had a dispute (for the stake of) each other\'s form. Kadru\ndefeated Suparni. She said, \'In the third heaven from here is the Soma; fetch\nit, and by it buy your release.\' Kadru is this (earth), Suparni yonder\n(heaven), the descendants of Suparni the metres. She said, \'For this do\nparents rear children; "in the third heaven from here is the Soma; fetch it,\nand by it buy your release" [1], so has Kadru said to me.\' The Jagati flew up,\nof fourteen syllables, but returned without obtaining it; it lost two\nsyllables, but returned with the (sacrificial) animals and consecration.\nTherefore the Jagati is the richest in cattle of the metres, and consecration\nwaits upon a man who is rich in cattle. The Tristubh flew up, of thirteen\nsyllables, but returned without obtaining it; it lost two syllables, but\nreturned with the (sacrificial) gifts [2] and penance. Therefore in the world\nof the Tristubh, the midday oblation, the gifts are brought. \'That in truth is\npenance\', they say, \'if a man gives his wealth.\' The Gayatri flew up, of four\nsyllables, together with a female goat with light. Then the goat won (Soma)\nfor her, and so the goat has the name. The Gayatri brought back the Soma and\nthe four syllables, and so became of eight syllables. The theologians say [3],\n\'For what reason is it that the Gayatri, the smallest of the metres, holds the\nforefront of the sacrifice?\' Because it brought down the Soma, it held the\nforefront of the sacrifice; therefore it is the most glorious (of the metres).\nBy the feet it grasped two of the oblations, and by the mouth one. The one it\ngrasped by the mouth it sucked; therefore two oblations are made of the pure\nSoma, the morning and midday oblations; therefore at the third oblation they\npour out the dregs of the Soma; for they regard it as sucked as it were [4].\nHe removes any admixture so that it may be pure; verily also he makes ready it\n(the _rjisa_ ). When the Soma was being borne away, the Gandharva Vi\xc3\xa7vavasu\nstole it. It was for three nights stolen; therefore after purchase the Soma is\nkept for three nights. The gods said, \'The Gandharvas love women; let us\nredeem it with a woman.\' They made speech unto a woman of one year old, and\nwith her redeemed it. She adopted the form of a deer and ran away from the\nGandharvas [5] that was the origin of the deer. The gods said, \'She has run\nfrom you; she comes not to us; let us both summon her.\' The Gandharvas uttered\na spell, the gods sang, she went to the gods as they sang. Therefore women\nlove one who sings; enamoured are women of him who thus knows. So if there is\nin a family one person who knows thus, men give their daughters in wedlock to\nthat family, even if there be other (wooers) in plenty [6]. He buys Soma with\na (cow) one year old; verily he buys it with the whole of speech. Therefore\nmen utter speech when one year old. He buys with a cow which has no horns,\nsmall ears, is not one-eyed or lame, and has not seven hooves; verily he buys\nit with all. If he were to buy it with a white cow, the sacrificer would\nbecome leprous. If he were to buy with a black one, it would be a funeral cow,\nand the sacrificer would be likely to die. If with one of both colours, it\nwould be one sacred to Vrtrahan, and he would either overcome his foe or his\nfoe him. He buys with a ruddy, yellow-eyed one. This is the form of Soma;\nverily he buys it with its own deity.\n\n### vi. 1. 7.\n\nThat became gold. Therefore they purify gold forth from the waters. The\ntheologians say, \'How is it that offspring are produced through that which is\nboneless, and yet are born with bones?\' Because he offers the gold, placing it\nin the ghee, therefore are offspring produced, through that which is boneless,\nand yet are born with bones. The ghee is Agni\'s loved abode, the gold, is\nradiance. \'This is thy body, O pure one. This is thy splendour\', he says;\nverily he unites Agni with his radiance and his body [1]; verily also he makes\nhim ready. If he were to deposit (the gold) without fastening it on, then the\nfoetuses of offspring would be liable to miscarriage. He deposits it fastening\nit on, to secure the foetuses. He fastens it so that it cannot be untied, for\nthe production of offspring. The cow with which the Soma is bought is speech.\n\'Thou art the strong\', he says; for what he strengthens in his mind, that he\nexpresses in speech. \'Grasped by mind\', he says; for by mind is speech\ngrasped. \'Acceptable to Visnu he says [2]. Visnu is the sacrifice; verily be\nmakes her accept able to the sacrifice. \'Through the impulse of thee, of true\nimpulse\', he says; verily he wins speech which is impelled by Savitr. As each\npart is performed, the Raksases are fain to injure the sacrifice; the path of\nAgni and Surya is one which the Raksases cannot injure. \'I have mounted the\neye of the sun, the pupil of the eye of Agni\', he says. He mounts the path\nwhich is not injured by the Raksases [3]. The cow with which the Soma is\nbought is speech. \'Thou art thought, thou art mind\', he says; verily he\ninstructs her. Therefore children are born instructed. \'Thou art thought\', he\nsays, for what one thinks in the mind one expresses in speech. \'Thou art\nmind\', he says; for what one grasps by the mind one performs. \'Thou art\nmeditation\', he says; for what one meditates with the mind one expresses in\nspeech [4]. \'Thou art the gift (to the priests)\', he says; for (the cow) is\nthe gift. \'Thou art of the sacrifice\', he says; verily he makes her fit for\nthe sacrifice. \'Thou art of kingly power\', he says, for she is of kingly\npower. \'Thou art Aditi, double-headed\', he says. In that to Aditi belong the\nopening and the concluding oblations of the sacrifices, therefore does he say\nthat. If (the cow) were not bound, she would be unrestrained; if she were\nbound by the foot, she would be the funeral cow, and the sacrificer would be\nlikely to perish [5]. If she were held by the ears, she would belong to\nVrtrahan, and the sacrificer would oppress another, or another would oppress\nhim. \'May Mitra bind thee by the foot\', he says. Mitra is the auspicious one\nof the gods; verily with his help he binds her by the foot. \'May Pusan guard\nthe ways\', he says. Pusan is this (earth); verily he makes her lady of this\n(earth), for the gaining thereof. \'For Indra the guardian!\' he says; verily he\nmakes Indra her guardian [6]. \'May thy mother approve, thy father\', he says;\nverily he buys with her approved. \'Go, O goddess, to the god\', he says; for\nshe is a goddess, and Soma is a god. \'To Indra Soma\', he says; for the Soma is\nborne to Indra. If he were not to say that text, the cow with which the Soma\nis bought would go away. \'May Rudra guide thee hither\', he says. Rudra is the\nharsh [7] one of the gods; verily he places him below her, for guiding hither.\nHe does as it were a harsh thing when he recites that (text) of Rudra\'s. \'In\nthe path of Mitra\', he says, for soothing. He buys indeed by speech when he\nbuys by the cow with which the Soma is bought. Hail! Return with Soma as thy\ncomrade, with wealth\', he says, verily having purchased by means of speech, he\nrestores speech to himself. The speech of him who knows thus is not likely to\nfail.\n\n### vi. 1. 8.\n\nHe follows six steps. Speech does not speak beyond the sixth day. He wins\nspeech in the size in which she is found in the path of the year. He offers in\nthe seventh footprint. The \xc3\x87akvari has seven feet, the \xc3\x87akvari is cattle;\nverily he wins cattle. There are seven domesticated animals, and seven wild;\nthere are seven metres to win both sets of animals. \'Thou art a Vasvi, thou\nart a Rudra\', he says; verily thus by her form he expounds her greatness [1].\n\'May Brhaspati make thee rejoice in happiness\', he says. Brhaspati is the holy\npower of the gods; verily by means of the holy power be wins cattle for him.\n\'May Rudra with the Vasus be favourable to thee\', he says, for the sake of\nprotection. \'I pour thee on the head of the earth, on the place of sacrifice\',\nhe says; for the place of sacrifice is the head of the earth. \'On the abode of\nthe offering\', he says; for the foot of the cow by which the Soma is bought is\nthe abode of the offering. \'Rich in ghee; hail!\' [2], he says. Because it was\nfrom her foot that ghee was pressed out, he says thus. If the Adhvaryu were to\noffer a libation where there were no fire, the Adhvaryu would become blind,\nand the Raksases would destroy the sacrifice. He offers after putting down the\ngold; verily he offers in that which has fire, the Adhvaryu does not become\nblind, and the Raksases. do not destroy the sacrifice. As each part is\nperformed, the Raksases are fain to injure the sacrifice. \'The Raksas is\nenclosed, the evil spirits are enclosed\', he says, for the smiting away of the\nRaksases [3]. \'Thus I cut the necks of the Raksas\'; \'Who hateth us and whom we\nhate\', he says. There are two persons, one whom he hates and one who hates\nhim; verily successively he cuts their necks. The foot of the cow with which\nthe Soma is bought is cattle; he pours (the dust of the footprint) so far as\nit is mixed with the ghee; verily he wins cattle. (Saying) \'Ours be wealth\',\nhe pours it; verily the Adhvaryu [4] does not deprive himself of cattle.\nSaying \'Thine be wealth\', he hands it to the sacrificer, and so bestows wealth\non the sacrificer. Saying \'Thine be wealth\', (the sacrificer hands it) to his\nwife. For a wife is the half of oneself, and to do so is as it were to deposit\nit in one\'s house. \'Let me attend on thee with Tvastr\'s aid\', he says. Tvastr\nis the maker of the forms of offspring, of pairings; verily he places form in\ncattle. For this world the Garhapatya fire is piled up; for yonder world the\nAhavaniya. If he were to cast it on-the Garhapatya fire, he would be rich in\ncattle in this world; if on the Ahavaniya, he would be rich in cattle in\nyonder world he casts it on both; verily he makes him rich in cattle in both\nworlds.\n\n### vi. 1. 9.\n\nThe theologians say, \'Should the Soma be clarified or not?\' Soma indeed is the\nking of plants; whatever falls upon it is swallowed by it. If be were to\nclarify it, it would be as when one expels from the mouth what has been\nswallowed; if he were not to clarify it, it would be as when something falls\nupon the eye and moves to and fro; the Adhvaryu would be hungry, the\nsacrificer would be hungry. \'O Soma-seller, purify the Soma\', he should say;\nso whether it be the one [1] or the other \'. he involves the Soma-seller in\nboth (faults), and therefore the Soma-seller is hungry. Aruna Aupave\xc3\xa7i said,\n\'At the buying of the Soma I win the third pressing.\' He measures (the Soma)\non the skin of beasts verily he wins cattle, for cattle are the third\npressing. If he desire of a man, \'May he be without cattle\', he should measure\nit for him on the rough side. The rough side indeed is not connected with\ncattle; verily he becomes without cattle. If he desire of a man, \'May he be\nrich in cattle\' [2], he should measure for him on the hairy side. That indeed\nis the form of cattle; verily by the form he obtains cattle for him; verily he\nbecomes rich in cattle. He buys it at the end of the waters; verily he buys it\nwith its sap. \'Thou art a home dweller\', he says; verily he makes it at home.\n\'Thy libation is bright\', he says; for bright is its libation. He advances\n(for it) with a cart; verily he advances to its mightiness. He advances with a\ncart [3], therefore what lives on the level is to be borne by a cart. Where,\nhowever, they bear it on their heads, therefore what lives on the hill is to\nbe borne on the head. With a verse, \'That god, Savitr\', in the Atichandas\nmetre he measures. The Atichandas is all the metres; verily with all the\nmetres he measures it. The Atichandas is the highest of the metres. In that he\nmeasures with a verse in the Atichandas metre, he makes it the highest of its\npeers. With each (finger) separately [4] he measures; verily he measures it\nwith each fresh in turn; therefore the fingers have various strengths. He\npresses down the thumb on them all; therefore it has equal strength with the\nother fingers; therefore all it accompanies. If he were to measure with all\n(the fingers), the fingers would grow united; with each separately he\nmeasures; therefore they grow separate. He measures five times with the Yajus.\nThe Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the\nsacrifice. (He measures) five times in silence [5]. They make up ten. The\nViraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj he wins proper\nfood. In that he measures with the Yajus, he wins the past; in that he\nmeasures in silence, the future. Now if there were only so much Soma as that\nwhich he measures, there would be enough for the sacrificer only, and not also\nfor the priests in the Sadas. With the words, \'For offspring thee!\' he draws\n(the cloth for the Soma) together; verily he makes the priests in the Sadas\nshare in it; with a garment he ties it up; the garment is connected with all\nthe gods [6]; verily he unites it with all the gods, the Soma is cattle; (with\nthe words) \'For expiration thee\', he ties it; verily he confers expiration\nupon cattle. (With the words) \'For cross-breathing thee\', he looses it; verily\nhe confers cross-breathing upon cattle; therefore the vital breaths do not\ndesert a sleeper.\n\n### vi. 1. 10.\n\nIf he were to barter (it) in response (to the words), \'Let me buy with one-\nsixteenth (of the cow) from thee, with one-eighth\', he would make the Soma not\nworth a cow, the sacrificer not worth a cow, the Adhvaryu not, worth a cow,\nbut he would not depreciate the mightiness of the cow. \'With a cow let me buy\nfrom thee\', verily he should say; verily he makes the Soma worth a cow, the\nsacrificer worth a cow, the Adhvaryu worth a cow, yet still he does not\ndepreciate the mightiness of the cow. He buys (it) with a she-goat; verily he\nbuys it full of fervour; he buys (it) with gold; verily he buys it bright [1];\nhe buys (it) with a milch cow; verily he buys it with milk for the mixing: he\nbuys (it) with a bull; verily he buys it with Indra; he buys (it) with a\ndraught ox, the draught ox is the bearer; verily by the bearer he buys the\nbearer of the sacrifice; he buys with two as a pair, to win a pair; he buys\nwith a garment, the garment is connected with all the gods; verily he buys it\nfor all the gods. These,, make up ten. The Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj\nis food; verily by the Viraj he wins proper food [2]. \'Thou art the bodily\nform of penance, Prajapati\'s kind\', he says, verily the Adhvaryu makes\natonement to the cattle, that he may not be cut off. He attains prosperity, be\nobtains cattle who knows thus. \'The bright with the bright for thee I buy\', he\nsays that is according to the text. The gods retook by force the gold where\nwith they purchased the Soma, saying, \'Who shall barter brilliance?\' The gold\nby which [3] he buys the Soma he should retake by force; verily he bestows\nbrilliance upon himself. \'Ours be light, darkness be on the Soma seller\', he\nsays; verily he places light in the sacrificer, and bestows darkness on the\nSoma-seller. If he were to strike (the Soma-seller) without inter twining (the\nflock of wool), then the serpents would bite during that year. \'Thus do I\nintertwine the necks of the biting serpents\', he says; the serpents do not\nbite that year, he pierces the Soma-seller with darkness. \'O Svana [4],\nBhraja\', he says; they indeed in yonder world guarded the Soma; from them they\ngrasped the Soma; if he were not to indicate to them those that serve as the\nprice of Soma, he would not have purchased the Soma, and they would not guard\nthe Sonia for him in yonder world. In that he indicates to them those that\nserve as the price of Soma, he really purchases the Soma, and they guard the\nSoma for him in yonder world.\n\n### vi. 1. 11.\n\nThe Soma when bought and tied up is connected with Varuna. Come as a friend to\nus, creating firm friendships\', he says, for atonement. Enter the right thigh\nof Indra\', he says; the gods placed the Soma which they purchased in the right\nthigh of Indra; now the sacrificer is Indra; therefore he says thus. \'With\nlife, with fair life\', he says; verily seizing the gods [1] he rises up. \'Fare\nalong the wide atmosphere\', he says; for Soma has the atmosphere for its\ndeity. \'Thou art the seat of Aditi. Sit on the seat of Aditi\', he says; that\nis according to the text. He severs it indeed when he makes what is connected\nwith Varuna connected with Mitra; he sets it down with a verse addressed to\nVaruna; verily he unites it with its own deity. He covers it round with a\ngarment, the garment is connected with all the gods; verily with all [2] the\ngods he unites it, and thus (it serves) for the smiting away of the Raksases.\n\'He hath stretched the atmosphere within the woods\', he says; for within the\nwoods he stretched the atmosphere. \'Strength in horses\', he says; for (he\nplaced) strength in horses. \'Milk in kine\', he says; for (he placed) milk in\nkine. \'Skill in the heart\', he says; for (he placed) skill in the heart.\n\'Varuna, Agni in dwellings\', he says; for Varuna (placed) Agni in dwellings.\n\'The sun in the sky\' [3], he says; for (he placed) the sun in the sky. \'The\nSoma in the hill\', he says; the hills are the pressing-stones; he places the\nSoma in them, who sacrifices; therefore he says thus. \'Thee, all-knowing god\'\nwith this verse addressed to Surya he fastens the black antelope skin, to\nsmite away the Raksases. \'Come hither, O ye oxen, strong to bear the yoke\', he\nsays; that is according to the text. \'Move forward, O lord of the world\', he\nsays; for he is the lord of creatures [4]; \'to all thy stations\', be says; for\nhe moves forward to all his stations. \'Let no opponent find thee\', he says;\nsince the Gandharva Vi\xc3\xa7vavasu stole the Soma when it was being carried below,\nhe says that, to prevent its being stolen. \'Thou art the good luck of the\nsacrificer\', he says; verily thus the sacrificer grasps the sacrifice, that it\nbe not interrupted. The Soma when bought and tied up indeed approaches the\nsacrificer in the shape of Varuna [5]. \'Honour to the radiance of Mitra and\nVaruna\', he says, for atonement. They bring forward this Soma, it rests with\nAgni, they in uniting overpower the sacrificer. Now the consecrated person has\nfor long been holding himself ready for the sacrifice. In that he offers an\nanimal to Agni and Soma, that is a buying-off of himself; therefore of it he\nshould not eat; for as it were it is a buying-off of a man. Or rather they\nsay, \'By Agni and Soma Indra slew Vrtra\'. In that he offers an animal to Agni\nand Soma, it slays hostile things for him; therefore he should eat of it. He\nhonours it with a verse addressed to Varuna; verily he honours it with its own\ndeity.\n\n## PRAPATHAKA II\n\n_\n\nThe Exposition of the Soma Sacrifice (continued)\n\n_\n\n### vi. 2. 1.\n\nIf he should offer hospitality after unyoking both (the oxen), he would break\nup the sacrifice. If (he should offer) before he has unyoked both, it would be\nas when hospitality is offered to one who has not yet arrived. One ox is\nunyoked, one ox is not unyoked; then he offers hospitality, for the\ncontinuance of the sacrifice. The wife (of the sacrificer) holds on (to the\ncart); for the wife is mistress of the household gear; verily he offers what\nis approved by the wife. The share of the wife in the sacrifice makes a pair;\nso the wife also [1] grasps the sacrifice that it may not be interrupted. With\nwhatever retinue the king comes, to all of them hospitality is offered; the\nmetres are the retinue of King Soma. \'Thou art the hospitality of Agni. For\nVisnu thee!\' he says; thus he offers (hospitality) to the Gayatri. \'Thou art\nthe hospitality of Soma. \'For Visnu thee!\' he says; thus he offers\n(hospitality) to the Tristubh. \'Thou art the hospitality of the stranger. For\nVisnu thee!\' he says; thus he offers (hospitality) to the Jagati [2]. \'For\nAgni thee, giver of wealth, for Visnu thee!\' he says; thus he offers\n(hospitality) to the Anustubh. \'For the eagle, bringer of the Soma, thee, for\nVisnu thee!\' he says; thus he offers (hospitality) to the Gayatri. He offers\nfive times. The Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily\nhe wins the sacrifice. The theologians say, \'For what reason is the Gayatri\noffered to on either side of the offering of hospitality?\' Because the Gayatri\nbrought the Soma down [3]; therefore is it offered to on both sides of\nhospitality, before and after. Hospitality is the head of the sacrifice, the\nsacrificial cake is offered on nine potsherds, therefore the head has nine\napertures. The sacrificial cake is offered on nine potsherds. The three sets\nof three potsherds are commensurate with the Trivrt Stoma, the Trivrt is\nbrilliance; verily he places brilliance in the head of the sacrifice. The\nsacrificial cake is offered on nine potsherds. The three sets of three\npotsherds are commensurate with the threefold breath, the breath is threefold\n[4]; verily in order he places the threefold breath in the head of the\nsacrifice. Now the _Saccharum spontaneum_ shoots are the eyelashes of\nPrajapati, and his lids are pieces of sugar-cane. In that the strew is of\n_Saccharum spontaneum_ and the dividing-stakes of sugar-cane, verily he brings\ntogether the eye of Prajapati. Now the libations made by the gods the Asuras\ntore and ate. The gods saw the _Gmelina arborea_ tree. (Thinking) \'It is fit\nfor work; by it one can perform work\', they made the enclosing sticks of\n_Gmelina arborea_ wood [5], and by them they smote away the Raksases. In that\nthe enclosing-sticks are made of _Gmelina arborea_ wood, it is for the smiting\naway of the Raksases. He makes them touch, that the Raksases may not go\nthrough them. He does not place one in front, for the sun which rises in front\nsmites away the Raksases. He places the kindling-sticks erect; verily from\nabove he smites away the Raksases; (he places one) with a Yajus, the other in\nsilence, to make a pair. He places two; the sacrifice has two feet; (verily\nthey serve) for support. The theologians say [6], \'There are both Agni and\nSoma here; why is hospitality offered to Soma and not to Agni?\' In that having\nkindled fire he places it on the fire, by that verily is hospitality offered\nto Agni. Or rather they say, \'Agni is all the gods.\' In that he kindles fire\nafter placing the oblation, he thus produces all the gods for the oblation\nwhen it has been placed.\n\n### vi. 2. 2.\n\nThe gods and the Asuras were in conflict. The gods fell out among themselves.\nBeing unwilling to accept one another\'s pre-eminence, they separated in five\nbodies, Agni with the Vasus, Soma with the Rudras, Indra with the Maruts,\nVaruna with the Adityas, Brhaspati with the All-gods. They reflected, \'Our\nfoes, the Asuras, we are profiting in that we are falling out among ourselves;\nlet us remove (from us) and deposit together those bodies which are dear to\nus; from these shall he depart who [1] first of us is hostile to another.\'\nTherefore of those who perform the Tanunaptra rite he who first is hostile\ngoes to destruction. In that he divides up the Tanunaptra, (it serves) for the\novercoming of the foe; he himself prospers, his foe is defeated. He divides\nfive times; for five times did they divide. Then again the Pankti has five\nsyllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice. \'For him\nwho rusheth on I seize thee\', he says; he who rushes on is the breath [2];\nverily he delights the breath. \'For him who rusheth around\', he says; he who\nrushes around is the mind; verily he delights the mind. \'For Tanunaptra\', he\nsays; for they divided up these bodies. \'For the mighty\', he says; for they\ndivided them up for strength. \'For the greatest in strength\', he says; for\nthey divided up the greatest part of themselves. \'Thou art unsurmounted, the\nunsurmountable\', he says; for that is unsurmounted and unsurmountable. \'The\nforce of the gods\' [3], be says; for that is the force of the gods. \'Guarding\nfrom imprecations, impervious to imprecations\', he says; for that guards from\nimprecations and is impervious to imprecations. \'May the lord of consecration\napprove my consecration\', he says; that is according to the text. The gods\nmaking the ghee a weapon smote Soma; now they come near the Soma as it were,\nwhen they perform the Tanunaptra. \'May thy every shoot, O god Soma, swell\', be\nsays. Whatever [4] of it becomes spoiled\' or is lost, that he purifies by it.\n\'May Indra swell for thee; do thou swell for Indra\', he says; verily he makes\nto swell both Indra and Soma. \'Make thy comrades to .swell with wealth and\nskill\', he says. The priests are his comrades; verily he makes them to swell.\n\'With good fortune may I accomplish thy pressing, O god Soma\' [5], he says;\nverily he invokes this blessing (on himself). Those who make the Soma to swell\nfall away from this world, for the Soma when made to swell has the atmosphere\nas its deity. \'Desired are riches exceedingly, for food, for prosperity\', he\nsays; verily by paying homage to heaven and earth they find support in this\nworld. The gods and the Asuras were in conflict. The gods in fear entered\nAgni; therefore they say, \'Agni is all the gods\'. They [6], making Agni their\nprotection, overcame the Asuras. Now he as it were enters Agni who undergoes\nthe intermediate consecration, (and it serves) for the overcoming of his foes;\nhe prospers himself, his foe is overcome. He protects himself by the\nconsecration, his offspring by the intermediate consecration. The girdle he\nmakes tighter; for his offspring are closer to him than himself. He drinks\nwarm milk, and rubs himself with bubbling water; for fire is extinguished by\ncold, (and these serve) for kindling. \'Thy dread form, O Agni\', he says;\nverily with its own deity he consumes the hot milk, for unity, for atonement.\n\n### vi. 2. 3.\n\nThe Asuras had three citadels; the lowest was of iron, then there was one of\nsilver, then one of gold. The gods could not conquer them; they sought to\nconquer them by siege; therefore they say--both those who know thus and those\nwho do not--\'By siege they conquer great citadels.\' They made ready an arrow,\nAgni as the point, Soma as the socket, Visnu as the shaft. They said, \'Who\nshall shoot it?\' [1] \'Rudra\', they said, \'Rudra is cruel, let him shoot it.\'\nHe said, \'Let me choose a boon; let me be overlord of animals.\' Therefore is\nRudra overlord of animals. Rudra let it go; it cleft the three citadels and\ndrove the Asuras away from these worlds. The observance of the Upasads is for\nthe driving away of foes. One should not offer another libation in front; if\nbe were to offer another libation in front [2], he would make something else\nthe beginning. He sprinkles clarified butter with the dipping-ladle to\nproclaim the sacrifice. He makes the offering after crossing over without\ncoming back; verily he drives away his foes from these worlds so that they\ncome not back. Then returning he offers the Upasad libation; verily having\ndriven away his foes from these worlds and having conquered he mounts upon the\nworld of his foes. Now the gods by the Upasads which they performed in the\nmorning drove away the Asuras from the day, by the Upasads (performed) in the\nevening (they drove away the Asuras) from the night. In that both morning and\nevening Upasads [3] are performed, the sacrificer drives away his foes from\nday and night. The Yajyas used in the morning should be made Puronuvakyas at\nnight, for variety. He performs three Upasads, these worlds are three; verily\nhe delights these worlds; they together make six, the seasons are six; verily\nhe delights the seasons. He performs twelve at an Ahina Soma sacrifice, the\nyear consists of twelve months; verily he de lights the year. They make\ntwenty-four [4], the half-months number twenty four; verily he delights the\nhalf-months. He should perform an awl-shaped intermediate consecration who\nwishes, \'May there be prosperity for me in this world\', (that is) one to begin\nwith, then two, then three, then four; this indeed is the awl-shaped\nintermediate consecration; verily there is prosperity for him in this world.\nHe should perform an intermediate consecration broader at the top than below\nwho wishes, \'May there be prosperity for me in yonder world\', (that is) four\nto begin with, then three, then two, then one; this indeed is the intermediate\nconsecration broader at the top than below; verily there is prosperity for him\nin yonder world.\n\n### vi. 2. 4.\n\nThey go to the world of heaven who perform the Upasads. Of them he who takes\nout (a little food) is left behind; one must take out carefully, (thinking) \'I\nhave not taken out anything.\' He who is left behind wearied among those who go\non their own mission sticks behind and lives at (home). Therefore after once\ntaking out, one should not take out a second time. One should take out of\ncurd, that is the symbol of cattle; verily by the symbol he wins cattle [1].\nThe sacrifice went away from the gods in the form of Visnu, and entered the\nearth. The gods sought him grasping hands. Indra passed over him. He said,\n\'Who has passed over me?\' \'I am he who smites in the stronghold; who art\nthou?\' \'I am he who brings from the stronghold.\' He said, \'Thou art called he\nwho smites in the stronghold. Now a boar, stealer of the good, [2] keeps the\nwealth of the Asuras which is to be won beyond the seven hills. Him smite, if\nthou art he who smites in the stronghold.\' He plucked out a bunch of Darbha\ngrass, pierced the seven hills, and smote him. He said, \'Thou art called he\nwho brings from the stronghold; bring him.\' So the sacrifice bore off the\nsacrifice for them; in that they won the wealth of the Asuras which was to be\nwon ( _v edyam_), that alone is the reason why the Vedi is so called. The\nAsuras [3] indeed at first owned the earth, the gods had so much as one seated\ncan espy. The gods said, \'May we also have a share in the earth?\' \'How much\nshall we give you?\' \'Give us as much as this Salavrki can thrice run round.\'\nIndra taking the form of a Salavrki thrice ran round on all sides the earth.\nSo they won the earth, and in that they won it therefore is the Vedi so called\n[4]. All this earth is the Vedi, but they measure off and sacrifice on so much\nas they deem they can use. The back cross-line is thirty feet, the eastern\nline is thirty-six feet, the front cross-line is twenty-four feet. These make\nup tens; the Viraj has ten syllables; the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj\nhe wins food. He digs up (the earth); verily he digs away whatever in it is\nimpure. He digs up; therefore the plants perish. He spreads the sacrificial\nstrew; therefore the plants again revive. He spreads over the strew the upper\nstrew. The strew is the people; the upper strew is the sacrificer; verily he\nmakes the sacrificer higher than the man who does not sacrifice; therefore the\nsacrificer is higher than the man who does not sacrifice.\n\n### vi. 2. 5.\n\nIf a weak man take up a burden, he breaks up into pieces. If there were twelve\nUpasads in the one-day rite, and three in the Ahina, the sacrifice would be\nupset. There are three Upasads in the one-day rite, twelve in the Ahina, to\npreserve the strength of the sacrifice; thus it is in order. One teat (of the\ncow) is used for a child, for that is fortunate. So he takes one teat for his\nmilk drink, then two, then three, then four. That [1] is the razor-edged drink\nby which he drives away his foes when born and repels them when about to be\nborn; verily also with the smaller he approaches the greater. He takes the\nfour teats first for his drink, then three, then two, then one. That is the\ndrink called \'of a beatific back\', full of fervour, and of heavenly character;\nverily also is he propagated with children and cattle. Gruel is the drink of\nthe Rajanya; gruel is as it were harsh; the Rajanya is as it were harsh [2],\nit is the symbol of the thunderbolt, (and serves) for success. Curds (is the\ndrink) of the Vai\xc3\xa7ya, it is the symbol of the sacrifice of cooked food, (and\nserves) for prosperity. Milk (is the drink) of the Brahman, the Brahman is\nbrilliance, milk is brilliance; verily by brilliance he endows himself with\nbrilliance and milk. Again by milk foetuses grow; the man who is consecrated\nis as it were a foetus; in that milk is his drink, verily thus he causes\nhimself to grow. Manu was wont thrice to take drink, the Asuras twice, the\ngods once [3]. Morning, midday, evening, were the times of Manu\'s drinking,\nthe symbol of the sacrifice of cooked food, (serving) for prosperity. Morning\nand evening were those of the Asuras, without a middle, a symbol of hunger;\nthence were they overcome. Midday and midnight were those of the gods; thence\nthey prospered and went to the world of heaven. Now with regard to his\ndrinking at midday and at midnight, it is in the middle that people feed\nthemselves; verily he places strength in the middle of himself, for the\novercoming of his foes. He prospers himself [4], his foe is overcome. Now the\nman who is consecrated is a foetus, the consecration-shed is the womb (in\nwhich he is). If the man who is consecrated were to leave the consecration-\nshed, it would be as when a foetus falls from the womb. He must not leave, to\nguard himself. The fire here is a tiger to guard the house. Therefore if the\nman who is consecrated were to leave (the shed), he would be likely to spring\nup and slay him. He must not leave, to protect himself. He lies on the right\nside; that is the abode of the sacrifice; verily he lies in his own abode. He\nlies turned towards the fire; verily he lies turned towards the gods and the\nsacrifice.\n\n### vi. 2. 6.\n\nOn a place of sacrifice where the sacrifice faces the east should he make him\nto sacrifice for whom he wishes, \'May the higher sacrifice condescend to him,\nmay he gain the world of heaven.\' That is the place of sacrifice where the\nsacrifice faces the east, where the Hotr as be recites the Prataranuvaka gazes\nupon the fire, water, and the sun. To him the higher sacrifice condescends, he\ngains the world of heaven. On a contiguous ( _apt a_) place of sacrifice\nshould he make him to sacrifice who has foes. He should make it touch the road\nor a pit so that neither a wagon nor a chariot can go between [1]. That is a\ncontiguous place of sacrifice. He conquers ( _apnoti_ ) his foe, his foe\nconquers him not. On a place of sacrifice which is elevated in one place he\nshould make him to sacrifice who desires cattle. The Angirases produced cattle\nfrom a place of sacrifice elevated in one place. It should be elevated between\nthe seat and the oblation-holders. That is a place of sacrifice elevated in\none place; verily he becomes possessed of cattle. On a place of sacrifice\nwhich is elevated in three places should he make him to sacrifice who desires\nheaven. The Angirases went to the world of heaven from a place of sacrifice\nelevated in three places. It should be elevated between the Ahavaniya fire and\nthe oblation holder [2], between the oblation-holder and the seat, and between\nthe seat and the Garhapatya fire. That is a place of sacrifice elevated in\nthree places; verily he goes to the world of heaven. On a place of sacrifice\nwhich is firm should he make him to sacrifice who desires support. That is a\nplace of sacrifice which is firm, which is level on all sides; verily he\nfinds, support. Where diverse plants are intertwined, there should he make him\nsacrifice who desires cattle. That is the form of cattle; verily by the form\nhe wins cattle for him [3]; verily be becomes possessed of cattle. On a place\nof sacrifice seized by destruction should he make him to sacrifice for whom he\ndesires, \'May I cause his sacrifice to be seized by destruction.\' That is a\nplace of sacrifice seized by destruction where there is a bare patch of level\nground; verily he causes his sacrifice to be seized by destruction. On a place\nof sacrifice which is distinctly marked should he cause him to sacrifice\nregarding whom they have doubts as to (admitting him to) common meals or to\nmarriage. It should be sloping east of the Ahavaniya and west of the\nGarhapatya. That is a place of sacrifice which is distinctly marked, be is\ndistinguished from his evil foe, they doubt not of him for common meal or\nwedding. On a place of sacrifice which is artificial should he make him\nsacrifice who desires wealth. Man must be made; verily he prospers.\n\n### vi. 2. 7.\n\nThe high altar taking the form of a lioness went away and remained between the\ntwo parties. The gods reflected, \'Whichever of the two she joins, they will\nbecome this.\' They called to her; she said, \'Let me choose a boon; through me\nshall ye obtain all your desires, but the oblation shall come to me before (it\ncomes to) the fire.\' Therefore do they besprinkle the high altar before (they\nsprinkle) the fire, for that was its chosen boon. He measures (it) round with\nthe yoke-pin [1], that is its measure; verily also by what is fitting he wins\nwhat is fitting. \'Thou art the abode of riches ( _vitta_ ) for me\', he says,\nfor being found ( _vitta_ ) she helped them; thou art the resort of the\nafflicted for me\', he says, for she helped them in affliction; \'protect me\nwhen in want\', he says, for she protected them when in want; \'protect me when\nafflicted\', he says, for she protected them when afflicted. \'May Agni, named\nNabhas, know (thee) [2], O Agni Angiras\', (with these words) he thrice strokes\nwith (the wooden sword); verily he wins the fires that are in these worlds. He\nstrokes in silence for the fourth time, verily he wins that which is not\nindicated. \'Thou art a lioness; thou art a buffalo\', he says, for it (the high\naltar) taking the form of a lioness went away and remained between the two\nparties. \'Extend wide; let the lord of the sacrifice extend wide for thee\', he\nsays; verily he enriches the sacrificer with offspring and cattle. \'Thou art\nfirm\' [3], (with these words) he strikes (the earth) together, for firmness.\n\'Be pure for the gods; be bright for the gods\', (with these words) he moistens\nit and scatters (sand) on it, for purity. \'May the cry of Indra guard thee in\nfront with the Vasus\', be says; verily be sprinkles it from the quarters.\n\'Since the high altar has gone to the gods, here must we conquer\' (thought)\nthe Asuras, and with bolts ready they advanced on the gods. Them the cry of\nIndra with the Vasus repelled in front [4]; the swift of mind with the Pitrs\non the right, the wise one with the Rudras behind, and Vi\xc3\xa7vakarman with the\nAdityas on the left. In that he sprinkles the high altar, verily thus does the\nsacrificer repel his foes from the quarters. Indra gave the Yatis to the\nSalavrkas; them they ate on the right of the high altar. Whatever is left of\nthe sprinkling waters he should pour on the right of the high altar; whatever\ncruel is there that he appeases thereby. He should think of whomever he hates;\nverily he brings affliction upon him.\n\n### vi. 2. 8.\n\nThe high altar said, \'Through me ye shall obtain all your desires.\' The gods\ndesired, \'Let us overcome the Asuras our foes.\' They sacrificed (with the\nwords),\'Thou art a lioness, overcoming rivals; hail!\' They over came the\nAsuras, their foes. Having overcome the Asuras, their foes, they felt desire,\n\'May we obtain offspring.\' They sacrificed (with the words), \'Thou art a\nlioness, bestowing fair offspring, hail!\' They obtained offspring. They having\nobtained offspring [1] felt desire, \'May we obtain cattle.\' They sacrificed\n(with the words), \'Thou art a lioness, bestowing increase of wealth; hail!\'\nThey obtained cattle. Having obtained cattle, they felt desire, \'May we obtain\nsupport.\' They sacrificed (with the words), \'Thou art a lioness, winning (the\nfavour of) the Adityas; hail!\' They found support here. Having found support\nhere, they felt desire, \'May we approach the deities for blessings.\' They\nsacrificed (with the words), \'Thou art a lioness; bring the gods to the pious\n[2] sacrificer; hail!\' They approached the deities for blessings. He sprinkles\nfive times; the Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily\nhe wins the sacrifice. He sprinkles transversely; therefore cattle move their\nlimbs transversely, for support. \'For beings thee!\' (with these words) he\ntakes up the ladle; of the gods that are that is the share; verily he\ntherewith delights them. He puts round the enclosing-sticks of _Butea\nfrondosa_ , for the holding apart of these worlds [3]. Agni had three elder\nbrothers. They perished when carrying the offering to the gods. Agni was\nafraid, \'This one here will come to ruin.\' He went away. The (night) he spent\namong the trees was with the _Butea frondosa_ : the (night) among the plants\nwas with the _Sugandhitejana_ ; the (night) among the cattle was between the\nhorns of a ram. The gods sought to start him forth. They found him, and said\nto him [4],\' Return to us; bear the offering for us.\' He said, \'Let me choose\na boon. Whatever of the offering when taken up falls outside the enclosing\nsticks, let that be the portion of my brothers.\' Therefore whatever of the\noffering when taken up falls outside the enclosing-sticks, that is their\nportion; verily therewith be delights them. He reflected, \'My brothers of old\nperished because they had bones. I will shatter bones.\' The bones he shattered\nbecame the _Buteafrondosa_ , the flesh which died on them bdellium. In that he\nbrings together these paraphernalia, verily thus be brings Agni together.\n\'Thou art the rubble of Agni\', he says, for the paraphernalia are the rubble\nof Agni. Or rather they say, \'These enclosing-sticks of _Buteafrondosa_ which\nlie around are in truth his brothers.\'\n\n### vi. 2.9.\n\nHe loosens the knot; verily he sets them free from the noose of Varuna; verily\nhe makes them fit for the sacrifice. Having sacrificed with a verse to Savitr,\nhe brings forward the oblation-holders; verily on the instigation of Savitr he\nbrings them forward. The axle which is tied on both sides is Varuna of evil\nspeech; if it were to creak, it would creak against the house of the\nsacrificer. \'With fair voice, O god, do thou address the dwelling\', he says;\nthe dwelling is the house; (verily it serves) for atonement. The wife (of the\nsacrificer) [1] anoints (them), for the wife is every one\'s friend, for\nfriendship. The share of the wife in the sacrifice makes a pair; verily also\nthe wife grasps the sacrifice that it may not be interrupted. Now the Raksases\nfollowing in its track seek to injure the sacrifice; he makes a libation in\nthe two tracks with Rc verses addressed to Visnu. The sacrifice is Visnu;\nverily he drives away the Raksases from the sacrifice. If the Adhvaryu were to\npour the libation in (a place) without fire, the Adhvaryu would become blind,\nthe Raksases would injure the sacrifice [2]. He puts gold down on it before\nmaking the libation; verily he makes the libation in that which has fire; the\nAdhvaryu does not become blind, the Raksases do not injure the sacrifice.\n\'Come ye two forward, ordaining the offering\', he says; verily he makes them\ngo to the world of heaven. \'There rejoice on the height of the earth \', he\nsays, for the place of sacrifice is the height of the earth. Now the oblation-\nholder is the head of the sacrifice. \'From the sky, O Visnu, or from the\nearth\' [3], with this Rc verse which contains a blessing he strikes in the\nprop of the southern oblation-holder; verily the sacrificer at the beginning\nof the sacrifice wins blessings. Now Danda Aupara split by the Vasat call the\naxle of the third oblation-holder; the third cover put on the oblation-holder\n(serves) to make up the third oblation-holder, The oblation-holder is the head\nof the sacrifice. \'Thou art the forehead of Visnu: thou art the back of\nVisnu\', he says. Therefore so often is the head divided. \'Thou art the string\nof Visnu; thou art the fixed point of Visnu\', he says, for the oblation-holder\nis connected with Visnu as its deity. Now the knot which he first ties, if he\nwere not to unloose it, the Adhvaryu would perish from suppression of urine;\ntherefore it must be unloosed.\n\n### vi. 2. 10.\n\n\'On the impulse of the god Savitr\', (with these words) he takes up the spade,\nfor impelling. \'With the arms of the A\xc3\xa7vins he says, for the A\xc3\xa7vins were the\npriests of the gods. \'With the hands of Pusan\', be for restraint. Now the\nspade is as it were a bolt; \'Thou art the spade; thou art the, woman\', he\nsays, to appease it. Now, as each part is performed, the Raksases seek to\ninjure the sacrifice; \'The Raksas is encompassed, the evil spirits are\nencompassed\', he says, to smite away the Raksases [1]. \'Here do I cut off the\nneck of the Raksas, who hateth us, and whom we hate\', he says; there are two\npeople, he whom he hates and he who hates him; verily straightway he cuts\ntheir necks. \'To sky thee, to atmosphere thee, to earth thee!\' he says; verily\nhe anoints it for these worlds. He anoints from the top downwards; therefore\n[2] men live on strength from the top downwards. Now he does a cruel deed in\nthat he digs; he pours down water, for atonement. He pours down (water) mixed\nwith barley; barley is strength, the Udumbara is strength; verily he unites\nstrength with strength. (The post) is of Udumbara wood of the height of the\nsacrificer. As great as is the sacrificer, so much strength does he put in it.\n\'Thou art the seat of the Pitrs\', (with these words) he spreads the strew, for\nwhat is dug in has the Pitrs for its deity [3]. If he were to set it up\nwithout strewing, it would be dug in and have the Pitrs for its deity; he sets\nit up after strewing; verily he sets it up in this (earth), and makes it firm-\nrooted.\' \'Support the sky, fill the atmosphere\', he says, for the distinction\nof these worlds. \'May Dyutana Maruta set thee up\', he says; Dyutana Maruta was\nwont to set up the Udumbara (post) of the gods; verily [4] by him he sets this\n(post) up. \'Thee that art winner of Brahmans, winner of nobles\', he says; that\nis according to the text. \'With ghee, O sky and earth, be filled\', (with these\nwords) he sacrifices on the Udumbara (post); verily with moisture he anoints\nsky and earth. He makes it run right to the end; verily completely does he\nanoint the sacrificer with brilliance. \'Thou art of Indra\', (with these words)\nhe puts down the covering, for the seat has Indra as its deity. \'The shade of\nall folk\', he says, for the seat is the shade of all folk. (A roof of) nine\ncoverings [5] should he fix for one who desires brilliance, commensurate with\nthe Trivrt Stoma; the Trivrt is brilliance; verily he becomes brilliant; one\nof eleven coverings (he should fix) for one who desires power; the Tristubh\nhas eleven syllables, the Tristubh is power; verily he becomes powerful. (A\nroof of) fifteen coverings (he should fix) for one who has foes; the\nthunderbolt is fifteenfold; (verily it serves) for the overcoming of foes. (A\nroof of) seventeen coverings (he should fix) for one who desires offspring-\nPrajapati is sixteenfold. (verily it serves) to gain Prajapati. (A roof of)\ntwenty-one coverings (he should fix) for one who desires support; the Ekavin\xc3\xa7a\nis the support of the Stomas; (verily it serves) for support. The Sadas is the\nstomach, the Udumbara is strength, in the middle he fixes (the post) of\nUdumbara wood; verily he places strength in the midst of offspring; therefore\n[6] in the middle they enjoy strength. In the world of the sacrificer are the\nsouthern coverings, in that of his foe are the northern; he makes the southern\nthe higher; verily he makes the sacrificer higher than the man who does not\nsacrifice; therefore the sacrificer is higher than the man who does not\nsacrifice. He fills up the crevices, for distinction; therefore people depend\non the forest. \'May our songs, O lover of song\', he says; that is according to\nthe text. \'Thou art the string of Indra;. thou art the fixed point of Indra\',\nhe says; for the Sadas has Indra for its deity. Now the knot which he first\nties, if he were not to unloose it, the Adhvaryu would perish through\nsuppression of urine; therefore it must be unloosed.\n\n### vi. 2. 11.\n\nThe oblation-holder is the head of the sacrifice, the sounding holes are the\nvital airs. They are dug in the oblation-holder; therefore. the vital airs are\nin the head. They are dug below; therefore the vital airs are below the head.\n\'I dig those which slay the Raksas, which slay the spell, and which are of\nVisnu\', he says, for the sounding-holes have Visnu for their deity. The Asuras\nin retreat dug in spells against the vital airs of the gods; they found them\nat the distance of an arm; therefore they are dug an arm\'s length deep. \'Here\ndo I cast out the spell [1] which an equal or an unequal hath buried\', he\nsays; there are two sorts of men, the equal and the unequal; verily whatever\nspell they dig against him he thus casts out. He unites them; therefore the\nvital airs are united within. He does not combine them; therefore the vital\nairs are not combined. He pours water over; therefore the vital airs are moist\nwithin. (The water) he pours is mixed with barley [2]; barley is strength, the\nsounding-holes are the vital airs; verily he places strength in the vital\nairs. He spreads over the strew; therefore the vital airs are hairy within. He\nbesprinkles (the holes) with butter; butter is brilliance, the sounding-holes\nare the vital airs; verily he places brilliance in the vital airs. The\npressing-boards are the jaws of the sacrifice; he does not join them, for the\njaws are not joined; or rather at a long Soma sacrifice they should be joined,\nfor firmness. The oblation-holder is the head of the sacrifice [3], the\nsounding-holes are the vital airs, the pressing-boards the jaws, the skin the\ntongue, the pressing-stones the teeth the Ahavaniya the mouth, the high altar\nthe nose, the Sadas the stomach. When he eats with his tongue on his teeth,\n(the food) goes to the mouth; when it goes to the mouth, then it goes to the\nstomach, therefore they press (the juice) with the pressing-stones on the\noblation-holder over the skin, sacrifice in the Ahavaniya, retire towards the\nwest, and consume (the Soma) in the Sadas. He who knows the milking of the\nViraj in the mouth of the sacrifice milks her; the Viraj is this (cow), the\nskin is its hide, the pressing-boards its udder, the sounding-holes its teats,\nthe pressing-stones its calves, the priests the milkers, Soma the milk. He,\nwho knows thus, milks her.\n\n## PRAPATHAKA III\n\n_\n\nThe Exposition of the Soma Sacrifice (continued)\n\n_\n\n### vi. 3. 1.\n\nFrom the pit he scatters (earth) on the altars; the pit is the birthplace of\nthe sacrifice; (verily it serves) to unite the sacrifice with its birthplace.\nThe gods lost by conquest the sacrifice; they won it again from the Agnidh\'s\naltar; the Agnidh\'s altar is the invincible part of the sacrifice. In that he\ndraws off the altar fires from that of the Agnidh, he renews the sacrifice\nfrom the invincible part of it. Conquered as it were they go who creep to the\nBahispavamana (Stotra) when the Bahispavamana has been sung [1], he says,\n\'Agnidh, draw off the fires, spread the strew, make ready the sacrificial\ncake.\' Verily having re-won the sacrifice they keep renewing it. At two\npressings he draws off by means of embers, at the third with (flaming)\nsplinters, to give it glory verily he completes it. The altars guarded the\nSoma in yonder world they took away the Soma from them; they followed it and\nsurrounded it. He who knows thus [2] wins an attendant. They were deprived of\nthe Soma drink; they besought the gods for the Soma drink; the gods said to\nthem, \'Take two names each; then shall ye gain it, or not.\' Then the altars\nbecame fires (also); therefore a Brahman who has two names is likely to\nprosper. Those which came nearest gained the Soma drink viz. the Ahavaniya,\nthe Agnidh\'s altar, the Hotr\'s, and the Marjaliya; therefore they sacrifice on\nthem. He leaves them out in uttering the cry for sacrifice, for [3] they were\ndeprived of the Soma drink. The gods drove away the Asuras who were in front\nby the sacrifices which they offered on the eastern side, and the Asuras who\nwere behind by those which they offered on the western side. Soma libations\nare offered in the east, seated to the west he besprinkles the altars; verily\nfrom behind and from in front the sacrificer smites away his enemies;\ntherefore offspring are engendered behind, and are brought forth in front [4].\nThe altars are the breaths; if the Adhvaryu were to go past the altars to the\nwest, he would mingle the breaths, he would be liable to die. The Hotr is the\nnavel of the sacrifice; the expiration is above the navel, the inspiration is\nbelow; if the Adhvaryu were to go past the Hotr to the west, he would place\nthe expiration in the inspiration, he would be liable to die. The Adhvaryu\nshould not accompany the song; the Adhvaryu\'s strength is his voice; if the\nAdhvaryu were to accompany the song, he would confer his voice on the Udgatr\n[5], and his voice would fail. The theologians say, \'The Adhvaryu should not\ngo beyond the Sadas to the west before the Soma offering is completed. Then\nhow is he to go to offer the sacrifices in the southern fire? Because that is\nthe end of the fires. But how are the gods to know whether it is the end or\nnot?\' He goes round the Agnidh\'s altar to the north and offers the sacrifices\nin the southern fire; verily he does not mingle the breaths. Some of the\naltars are besprinkled, some not; those which he besprinkles he delights;\nthose which he does not besprinkle he delights by indicating them.\n\n### vi. 3. 2.\n\nThe Vaisarjana offerings are made for the world of heaven. He offers in the\nGarhapatya with two verses; the sacrificer has two feet; (verily it serves)\nfor support. He offers in the Agnidh\'s fire; verily he approaches the\natmosphere; he offers in the Ahavaniya; verily he makes him go to the world of\nheaven. The Raksases sought to harm the gods as they were going to the world\nof heaven; they smote away the Raksases through Soma, the king, and making\nthemselves active went to the world of heaven, to prevent the Raksases seizing\nthem. The Soma is ready at hand; so he offers [1] the Vaisarjanas, to smite\naway the Raksases. \'Thou, O Soma, brought about by ourselves\', he says, for he\nis the one who brings about by himself; \'from hostility brought about by\nothers\', he says, for the Raksases are brought about by others; \'thou art the\ngiver of wide protection\', he says; in effect he says, \'give us wide\n(protection).\' \'May the active one gladly partake of the ghee\', he says;\nverily he makes the sacrificer active and causes him to go to the world of\nheaven, to prevent the Raksases seizing him. They take up the Soma [2], the\npressing-stones, the cups for Vayu, the wooden trough; they lead forth the\nwife (of the sacrificer), they make the carts move along with them; verily\nwhatever is his he goes with it to the world of heaven. He offers in the\nAgnidh\'s fire with a verse containing the word \'lead\', for leading to the\nworld of heaven. He places on the Agnidh\'s altar the pressing-stones, the cups\nfor Vayu, and the wooden trough, for they take it away from them; if he were\nto put it with them, it would become spoiled. He makes it go forward with a\nverse addressed to Soma; verily by means of its own [3] divinity he makes it\ngo forward. \'Thou art the seat of Aditi; do thou sit on the seat of Aditi\', he\nsays; that is according to the text. Hitherto the sacrificer has guarded the\nSoma. \'This, O god Savitr, is the Soma of you (gods)\', he says; verily\ninstigated by Savitr, he hands it over to the gods. \'Thou, O Soma, god to the\ngods, hast thou gone\', he says, for it being a god [4] goes to the gods. \'I\nhere, man to men\', he says, for he being a man goes to men. If he were not to\nsay that formula, the sacrificer would be without offspring or cattle. \'With\noffspring, with increase of wealth\', he says; verily he abides in this world\nwith offspring and with cattle. \'Homage to the gods\', he says, for homage is\nthe due of the gods; \' _svadh a_\' to the Pitrs\', be says, for the _svadh a_\ncall is the due of the Pitrs [5]. \'Here (may) I (be free) from Varuna\'s\nnoose\', he says; verily he is freed from Varuna\'s noose. \'O Agni, lord of\nvows,\' (he says). \'One should recover one\'s former body\', they say, \'for who\nknows if the richer, when his will is accomplished will restore it or not.\'\nThe pressing-stones are the troop of thieves of King Soma; him, who knowing\nthus, places the pressing-stones on the Agnidh\'s altar, the troop of thieves\nfinds not.\n\n### vi. 3. 3.\n\nHaving sacrificed with a verse addressed to Visnu, he approaches the post. The\npost has Visnu for its deity; verily he approaches it with its own deity. \'I\nhave passed by others, I have not approached others\', he says, for he passes\nby others, and does not approach others. I have found thee nearer than the\nfarther, farther than the near\', he says, for he finds it nearer than the\nfarther, farther than the near. \'I welcome thee that art of Visnu, for the\nsacrifice to the gods\' [1], he says, for he welcomes it for the sacrifice to\nthe gods. \'Let the god Savitr anoint thee with honey\', he says; verily he\nanoints it with glory. \'O plant, guard it; O axe, harm it not\', he says; the\naxe is the thunderbolt; (verily it serves) for atonement. The brilliance of\nthe tree which fears the axe falls away with the first chip; the first chip\nwhich falls he should take up; verily he takes it up with its brilliance [2].\nThese worlds are afraid of the falling forward of the tree. \'With thy top\ngraze not the sky, with thy middle harm not the atmosphere\', he says; verily\nhe makes it tender for these worlds. \'O tree, grow with a hundred shoots\',\n(with these words) he sacrifices on the stump; therefore many (shoots) spring\nup from the stump of trees. \'May we grow with a thousand shoots\', he says;\nverily he invokes this blessing. He should cut it so that it will not touch\nthe axle [3]. If he were to cut it so that it would touch the axle, the cattle\nof the sacrificer would be liable to perish. If he desire of any one, \'May he\nbe without support\', he should cut for him a branch; this among trees is not\nsupported; verily he is without support. If he desire of any one, \'May he be\nwithout cattle\', he should cut for him (a post) without leaves and with a\nwithered top; this among trees is without cattle; verily he becomes without\ncattle. If he desire of any one, \'May he be rich in cattle\', he should cut for\nhim one with many leaves and many branches; this [4] among trees is rich in\ncattle; verily he becomes rich in cattle. He should cut one that is supported\nfor one who desires support; this among trees is supported which grows from\nits own birthplace on level ground and is firm. He should cut one which leans\ntowards the west, for it is leaning over for the sacrifice. He should cut one\nof five cubits for him of whom he desires, \'May the higher sacrifice\ncondescend to him\'; the Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold,\nthe higher sacrifice condescends to him [5]. (He should cut one) of six cubits\nfor one who desires support; the seasons are six; verily he finds support in\nthe seasons. (He should cut one) of seven cubits for one who desires cattle;\nthe \xc3\x87akvari has seven feet, the \xc3\x87akvari is cattle; verily he wins cattle. (He\nshould cut one) of nine cubits for one who desires brilliance, commensurate\nwith the Trivrt Stoma; the Trivrt is brilliance; verily he becomes brilliant.\n(He should cut one) of eleven cubits for one who desires power; the Tristubh\nhas eleven syllables, the Tristubh is power; verily he becomes powerful. (He\nshould cut one) of fifteen cubits for one who has foes; the thunderbolt is\nfifteenfold; (verily it serves) for the overcoming of foes. (He should cut\none) Of seventeen cubits for one who desires offspring; Prajapati is\nseventeenfold; (verily it serves) to gain Prajapati. (He should cut one) of\ntwenty-one cubits for one who desires support; the Ekavin\xc3\xa7a is the support of\nthe Stomas; (verily it serves) for support. It has eight corners; the Gayatri\nhas eight syllables, the Gayatri is brilliance, the Gayatri is the beginning\nof the sacrifice; verily it is commensurate with brilliance, the Gayatri, the\nbeginning of the sacrifice.\n\n### vi. 3. 4.\n\n\'To earth thee! To atmosphere thee! To sky thee!\' he says; verily for these\nworlds he anoints it. He anoints from the foot upwards, for upwards as it were\nis the world of heaven. Cruel as it were is that which he does when he digs;\nhe pours water over, for expiation he pours (water) mixed with barley; barley\nis strength. The post is of the height of the sacrificer. As great as is the\nsacrificer, so much strength does he put in it [1]. \'Thou art the seat of the\nPitrs\', (with these words) he spreads the strew, for what is dug in has the\nPitrs for its deity.\' If he were to set it up without strewing, it would be\ndug in and have the Pitrs for its deity; he sets it up after strewing; verily\nhe sets it up in this (earth). He throws down the splinter of the post; verily\nhe sets it up with its glory. \'Thee to the plants with fair berries\', (with\nthese words) he fixes on the top [2] therefore at the top plants bear fruit.\nHe anoints it, butter is glory. The corner near the fire is of the same height\nas the sacrificer; in that he anoints the corner near the fire, he anoints\nwith brilliance the sacrificer. He anoints it to the end; verily completely\ndoes he anoint the sacrificer with brilliance. He rubs it all around; verily\nhe places brilliance in him completely. \'Support the sky, fill the atmosphere,\nwith thy base make firm the earth\', he says, for the separation of these\nworlds. With a verse addressed to Visnu [3] he arranges it; the post has Visnu\nfor its deity; verily he arranges it with its own deity. He arranges it with\ntwo (verses); the sacrificer has two feet; (verily it serves) for support. If\nhe desire of a man, \'May I deprive him of brilliance, of the deities, of\npower\', he should move the corner near the fire to one side or the other of\nthe Ahavaniya; verily he deprives him of brilliance, of the deities, of power.\nIf he desire of a man, \'May I unite him with brilliance, with the deities,\nwith power\' [4], he should set up for him the corner (of the post) near the\nfire in a line with the Ahavaniya; verily he unites him with brilliance, with\nthe deities, with power. Thee that art winner of Brahmans, winner of nobles\',\nhe says that is according to the text. He winds round (the grass); the girdle\nis strength, the post is of the same height as the sacrificer; verily he\nunites the sacrificer with strength. He winds (it) round at the level of the\nnavel; verily at the level of the navel he bestows upon him strength;\ntherefore at the level of the navel men enjoy strength. If he desire of a man,\n\'May I deprive him of strength\' [5], he should put (it) on either upwards or\ndownwards; verily he deprives him of strength. If he desire, \'May Parjanya\nrain\', he should put it on downwards, verily he brings down rain; if he\ndesire, \'May Parjanya not rain\', he should put it on upwards; verily he holds\nup rain. What is dug in belongs to the Pitrs, what is above the part dug in up\nto the girdle belongs to men, the girdle belongs to the plants [6], what is\nabove the girdle up to the top to the All-gods, the top to Indra, the rest to\nthe Sadhyas. The post is connected with all the gods; verily in setting up the\npost he delights all the gods. By means of the sacrifice the gods went to the\nworld of heaven; they reflected, \'Men will equal us\'; they blocked the way by\nthe post and went to the world of heaven; the Rsis discerned that (world) by\nmeans of the post, and that is why it is called post [7]. In that be sets up\nthe post, (it is) to discern the world of heaven. He puts (it) up to the east\n(of the fire), for before the sacrifice it is proclaimed, for what is not\nproclaimed is that of which when it is passed men say, \'This should have been\ndone.\' The Sadhya gods despised the sacrifice; the sacrifice touched them not;\nwhat was superabundant in the sacrifice touched them. The superabundant part\nof the sacrifice is the producing of fire and casting it on the fire; the\nsuperabundant part [8] of the post is the part above the top; that is their\nshare; verily by it he delights them. The gods when the Soma sacrifice was\ncomplete cast the offering-spoons (into the fire) and the post; they\nreflected, \'Here we are making a disturbance of the sacrifice\', they saw a\nransom in the bunch of grass for the offering-spoons, in the chip for the\npost. When the Soma sacrifice is complete he casts (in the fire) the bunch of\ngrass, he offers the chip, to avoid disturbing the sacrifice.\n\n### vi. 3. 5.\n\nThe Sadhya gods were in this world and nothing else living. They offered Agni\nas a sacrifice to Agni, for they found nothing else to offer; thence indeed\nthese creatures were born; in that he casts the fire on the fire after\nproducing it, (it serves for) the propagation of offspring. Now the fire is\nRudra, the beast the sacrificer; if he were to produce the fire after offering\nthe beast, he would place the sacrificer in the power of Rudra [1], and he\nwould be liable to die. Or rather they say, \'All the gods are the fire, the\nbeast the offering\'. In that he produces the fire after offering the beast, he\nbrings forth all the gods for the offering which is made ready. The fire\nshould be produced, after bringing up (the beast). The offering is then\nneither finished nor not begun. \'Thou art the birthplace of Agni\', he says,\nfor that is the birthplace of Agni. \'Ye are the two male ones\', he says, for\nthey are the two male ones [2]. \'Thou art Urva\xc3\xa7i, thou art Ayu\', he says, to\nmake a pair. \'Anointed with ghee do ye produce a male\', he says, for they\nproduce a male who (produce) Agni. \'Be born with the Gayatri metre\', he says;\nverily he produces him with the metres. \'Recite for Agni as he is being\nproduced\', he says; he recites a verse to Savitr; verily, instigated by Savitr\nhe produces him. \'Recite for him who is born\' [3], \'For him who is being cast\nforward recite\', he says; verily as each part is performed he completes him.\nHe recites all Gayatri verses; Agni has the Gayatri as his metre; verily he\nunites him with his own metre. The fire is in front; having produced fire he\ncasts it forward; the two uniting overpower the sacrificer; \'Be of one mind\nwith us\', he says, to appease (them). He offers after casting (the fire)\nforward; verily he gives him food on birth; he offers with melted butter; the\nmelted butter is the dear home of Agni; verily he unites him with his dear\nhome, and also with brilliance.\n\n### vi. 3. 6.\n\n\'For food thee!\' (with these words) he takes up the strew, for he who\nsacrifices strives ( _ich ate_) as it were. \'Thou art the impeller\', he says,\nfor he brings them up. \'To the gods the servants of the gods have come\', he\nsays, for being the servants of the gods they go to the gods. \'The priests,\nthe eager ones\', he says; the priests are the priests, the eager ones,\ntherefore he says thus. \'O Brhaspati, guard wealth\' [1], he says; Brhaspati is\nthe holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily by the holy power he wins cattle\nfor him. \'Let thy oblations taste sweet\', be says; verily he makes them sweet.\n\'O god Tvastr, make pleasant our possessions\', he says; Tvastr is the form-\nmaker of the pairings of cattle; verily he places form in cattle. \'Stay, ye\nwealthy ones\', he says; the wealthy ones are cattle; verily he makes cattle\nabide for him. \'On the impulse of god Savitr\' [2], (with these words) he takes\nup the rope, for instigation. \'With the arms of the A\xc3\xa7vins\', he says, for the\nA\xc3\xa7vins were the Adhvaryus of the gods. \'With the hands of Pusan\', he says, for\nrestraining. \'O offering to the gods, I seize thee with the noose of sacred\norder\', he says; sacred order is truth; verily with truth which is sacred\norder he seizes it. He winds (the rope) round transversely, for they fasten a\n(beast) for killing in front; (verily it serves) for distinction. \'Fear not\nmen\', (with these words) he fastens it, for security. \'For the waters [3]\nthee, for the plants thee I sprinkle\', be says, for from the waters, from the\nplants, the beast is born. \'Thou art a drinker of the waters\', he says, for he\nis a drinker of the waters who is offered in sacrifice. \'O ye divine waters,\nmake it palatable, a very palatable offering for the gods\', he says; verily he\nmakes it palatable. From above he sprinkles (it); verily he makes it pure from\nabove; he makes it drink; verily within he makes it pure; from below he\nbesprinkles (it); verily all over he makes it pure.\n\n### vi. 3. 7.\n\nBy means of Agni as Hotr the gods defeated the Asuras. Recite for Agni as he\nis kindled\', he says, for the overcoming of foes. He recites seventeen\nkindling-verses; Prajapati is seventeenfold; (verily it serves) to win\nPrajapati. He recites seventeen; there are twelve months and seven seasons,\nthat is the year; offspring are born in the course of the year; (verily it\nserves) for the propagation of offspring. The gods, after reciting the\nkindling-verses, could not discern the sacrifice; Prajapati silently performed\n[1] the libation of ghee; then did the gods discern the sacrifice; in that\nsilently he performs the libation of ghee, (it serves) for the revelation of\nthe sacrifice. The sacrifice was with the Asuras; the gods took it by the\nsilent offering; in that silently he performs the libation of ghee, he takes\naway the sacrifice of his foe. He rubs the enclosing-sticks; verily he\npurifies them. Thrice each he rubs them, for the sacrifice is thrice repeated;\nalso (it serves) to smite away the Raksases. They make up twelve; the year has\ntwelve [2] months; verily he delights the year, verily also he endows him with\nthe year, for the gaining of the world of heaven. The libation of ghee is the\nhead of the sacrifice, the fire is all the gods; in that he performs the\nlibation of ghee, verily the sacrificer at the beginning of the sacrifice wins\nall the gods. The libation of ghee is the head of the sacrifice, the beast is\nthe body; having performed the libation of ghee he anoints the beast; verily\non the body of the sacrifice [3] he places the head. \'Let thy breath be united\nwith the wind\', he says; the breath has the wind for its deity; verily he\noffers its breath in the wind. \'Thy limbs with the sacrificers, the lord of\nthe sacrifice with his prayer\', he says; verily he causes the lord of the\nsacrifice to obtain its blessing. Vi\xc3\xa7varupa, Tvastr\'s son, vomited over the\nbeast from above; therefore they do not cut off (portions) from the beast\nabove; in that he anoints the beast from above, verily he makes it pure [4].\nHe chooses the priests, verily he chooses the metres, he chooses seven; there\nare seven tame animals, seven wild; there are seven metres, (and so it serves)\nto win both. He offers eleven fore-sacrifices; ten are the vital airs of the\nbeast, the body is the eleventh; verily his fore-offerings are of the same\nsize as the beast. One (of them) lies around the omentum; verily the body lies\naround the body. The axe is a thunderbolt, the splinter of the sacrificial\npost is a thunderbolt, the gods by making a thunderbolt of the ghee smote\nSoma. \'Anointed with ghee, do ye guard the beast\', he says; verily,\noverpowering it by means of the thunderbolt, he offers it.\n\n### vi. 3. 8.\n\nHe encircles (it) with fire; verily he makes it completely offered, that\nnothing may be lost, for that which falls of the oblation is (thus) not lost.\nHe encircles (it) with fire thrice, for the sacrifice is thrice repeated; also\n(it serves) to smite away the Raksases. The theologians say, \'Should the beast\nbe grasped hold of, or not?\' Now the beast is led to death; if he were to\ngrasp hold of it, the sacrificer would be likely to die. Or rather they say,\n\'The beast is led to the world of heaven\' [1]; if he were not to grasp hold of\nit, the sacrificer would be bereft of the world of heaven. He grasps hold (of\nit) by means of the omentum-forks; that is as it were neither grasped nor yet\nnot grasped. \'Give directions, O Hotr, for making ready the oblations to the\ngods\', he says, for an act that is directed is carried out. \'Ye wealthy ones,\ndo ye kindly resort to the lord of the sacrifice\', he says; that is according\nto the text. With the fire he goes in front, to smite away the Raksases.\n\'Guard from contact with earth\', (with these words) he casts down the strew\n[2], that nothing may be lost, for that which falls on the strew is not lost;\nverily also he places it on the strew. The Adhvaryu turns away from the beast\nas it is slaughtered; verily he conceals himself from cattle, that he may not\nbe cut off. He attains fortune, and obtains cattle who knows thus. The wife is\nled forward from the back place; \'Homage to thee, O extended one\', he says;\nthe extended are the rays of the sun [3]; verily he pays homage to them. \'Come\nforward, irresistible\', he says; the resisting is the foe; (verily it serves)\nto beat away the foe. \'Along the stream of ghee, with offspring, with increase\nof wealth\', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. \'O ye waters, goddesses,\npurifying\', he says; that is according to the text.\n\n### vi. 3. 9.\n\nWhen the beast is offered in sacrifice, pain seizes its vital airs. \'Let thy\nspeech swell, let thy breath swell\' he says; verily he removes the pain from\nthe vital airs. From the vital airs the pain enters the earth; (with the\nwords) \'Hail to the and night!\' he pours it down; verily he removes the pain\nof the earth by day and night. \'O plant, protect him\', \'O axe, harm him not\',\nhe says; the axe is a thunderbolt [1]; (verily it serves) for atonement. He\ncuts from the sides, for men cut from the middle; be cuts crossways, for men\ncut along; for distinction. \'Thou art the share of the Raksases \', (with these\nwords) he casts the strew, having anointed it on the thick part; verily with\nthe blood he propitiates the Raksases. \'This Raksas here I lead to the lowest\ndarkness, who hateth us and whom we hate\', he says; there are two (kinds of)\npersons, he whom he [2] hates and he who hates him; both these he leads to the\nlowest darkness.\' \'For food ( _is e_) thee!\' (with these words) he draws out\nthe omentum, for he who sacrifices strives as it were. If he were to pierce\n(it), Rudra would be likely to slay his cattle; if he were not to pierce (it),\nit would not be fixed; with one he pierces, with the other not, for support.\n\'In ghee, O sky and earth, be covered\', he says; verily with fat he anoints\nsky and earth. \'Uncut [3] with wealth of heroes (give us) riches\', he says;\nthat is according to the text. Now cruel as it were is what he does when he\ndraws out the omentum. \'Fare along the broad atmosphere\', he says, for\natonement. Now he who grasps hold of the beast as it is led to death falls\naway from this world; he takes again hold of the omentum-forks; verily he\nfinds support in this world. With the fire he goes in front, to smite away the\nRaksases; verily also with the oblation he follows the deities [4]. He should\nnot pass over the last of the embers; if he were to pass over the last of the\nembers, he would despise the deities. \'O Vayu, taste the drops\', he says;\ntherefore the drops are produced separately. The omentum is the chief part of\ncattle, the strew the chief of plants; verily he unites the chief with the\nchief; verily also in the plants he establishes cattle. \'Give directions for\nthe Svaha cries\', he says [5], for the completion of the sacrifice. The\nspeckled butter is the expiration and inspiration of cattle, the omentum is\nthe body; having poured butter on the speckled ghee,\' he pours on the omentum;\nverily in the body of cattle he deposits expiration and inspiration. \'Hail! Go\nto Urdhvanabhas, the offspring of the Maruts\', he says; Urdhvanabhas, the\noffspring of the Maruts, used to cast forward the omentum-forks of the gods;\nverily through him he casts them forward. He casts them forward in opposite\ndirections; therefore expiration and inspiration are in opposite directions.\n\n### vi. 3. 10.\n\nHaving offered in sacrifice the beast, he strews over (it) a cake, verily he\nsacrifices it with its sap. Having performed the rite with the omentum, he\nperforms with the cake; the cake is strength; verily he places strength in the\nmidst of cattle; verily also he closes the cut in the beast. Having made\noffering of the speckled ghee, he thrice asks, \'Is the oblation cooked,\n\xc3\x87amitr?\' for the gods found truth in three (cookings). He who says what is not\ncooked is cooked (is burdened) with sin. The speckled butter is the expiration\nand the inspiration of cattle [1]; when the beast is offered the body comes\ninto the heart; in that he sprinkles the heart with speckled ghee, he thus\nplaces expiration and inspiration in the body of cattle. By means of the beast\nthe gods went to the world of heaven. They reflected, \'Men will mount after\nus.\' They cut off its head and made its sap stream forth; it became the Praksa\n(tree); that is the nature of the Praksa. In that there is a branch of the\nPraksa above the strew, so he cuts off from the victim when it has its sap\n[2]. As the beast is borne along the Raksases follow after it; he takes it\nbetween the sacrificial post and the Ahavaniya, to smite away the Raksases.\nWhen the beast is offered its mind departs. \'Recite to Manota, for the\noblation which is being divided\', he says verily he secures its mind. He cuts\noff eleven portions; ten are the vital airs of the beast, the body is the\neleventh, he cuts off as much as is the size of the beast [3]. First he makes\na portion of the heart, then of the tongue, then of the breast: what he\nconceives with the heart, that he says with the tongue; what he says with the\ntongue, that he utters from the breast. That is the order in the case of the\nbeast. If he cuts off thus and then cuts from the rest at will, still the\ncutting off from that animal has been made in order. In the middle he makes a\nportion of the intestines, for breath is in the middle; he makes a portion of\nthe upper part [4], for breath is in the upper part; whether he does one, or\nthe other, there is variation in both cases. A Brahman on birth is born with a\nthreefold debt, of pupilship to the Rsis, of sacrifice to the gods, of\noffspring to the Pitrs. He is freed from his debt who has a son, is a\nsacrificer, and who has lived as a pupil: this (debt) he performs ( _a\nvadayate_) by these cuttings off\', and that is why the cuttings-off ( _avad\nana_) have their name. The gods and the Asuras were in conflict. The gods said\nto Agni, \'With thee as our hero let us overcome the Asuras\' [5]. He said, \'Let\nme choose a boon; let me have a choice part of the beast.\' He chose that\nchoice part (of the beast), the shoulder from the fore part, the intestines\nfrom the middle, the hip from the hind part. Then the gods prospered, the\nAsuras were defeated; in that he makes portions of three members it is for the\novercoming of his foe; he prospers himself, his foe is defeated. He cuts off\ntransversely; therefore cattle move forward their limbs transversely, for\nsupport.\n\n### vi. 3. 11.\n\nHe covers the dipping-spoons with fat; cattle are distinguished by fat; verily\nhe bestows on cattle their distinguishing mark. He covers (them) after putting\n(the fat) on the soup; the soup is the sap of cattle; verily he bestows sap\nupon cattle. He stirs the oblation of fat with the rib; the rib is the middle\nof cattle, the fat is the sap of cattle; in that he stirs the oblation of fat\nwith the rib, he places sap in the middle of cattle. Now they kill [1] the\nbeast when they dispose of it; the expiration has Indra for its deity, the\ninspiration has Indra also. \'May Indra\'s expiration be set in every limb\', he\nsays; verily he bestows expiration and inspiration upon cattle. \'O god Tvastr,\nlet much be united for thee\', he says; for cattle have Tvastr as their deity.\n\'When ye that are various become of one form\', he says; for they being various\nbecome then of one form. \'Over thee as thou goest among the gods [2] for help\nlet thy comrades and thy father and mother rejoice\', he says; verily he makes\nhim, approved by his mother and his father, go to the world of heaven. With a\nhalf-verse be offers the oblation of fat; the half-verse is yonder (sky) and\nthe half-verse is this (earth); verily with sap he adorns both. He offers to\nthe quarters; verily with sap he adorns the quarters; verily from the quarters\nhe wins strength and sap. The speckled butter is the expiration and the\ninspiration of cattle; cattle have the lord of the forest [3] for their deity;\nin that having made offering of the speckled butter he says, \'Recite for the\nlord of the forest, give directions for the lord of the forest\', he bestows\nexpiration and inspiration upon cattle. Of each he divides the divided pieces;\nthere fore cattle have various forms. He moistens (it) with soup; soup is the\nsap of cattle; verily he bestows sap upon cattle. He invokes the Ida; the Ida\nis cattle; verily he invokes cattle. Four times he invokes [4], for cattle\nhave four feet. If he desire of a man, \'May he have no cattle\', he should take\nfor him (a piece) without fat; cattle are distinguished by fat; verily by\nmeans of their distinctive mark he deprives him of cattle, and he has no\ncattle. If he desire of a man, \'May he have cattle\', he should take for him (a\npiece) with fat; cattle are distinguished by fat; verily by means of their\ndistinctive mark he wins cattle for him, and he has cattle. Prajapati created\nthe sacrifice; he first created the butter [5], in the middle the beast, last\nthe speckled butter; therefore the fore-sacrifices are performed with butter,\nthe beast (is offered) in the middle, and the after-sacrifices with speckled\nbutter. Therefore that is mixed as it were, for it was created last. He offers\neleven after-sacrifices; ten are the vital airs of the beast, the body is the\neleventh; he offers as many after-sacrifices as is the size of the beast. Now\nthey kill the beast when they dispose of it; the speckled butter is the\nexpiration and the inspiration of cattle; in that he per forms the after-\nsacrifices with speckled butter, verily he bestows expiration and inspiration\nupon cattle.\n\n## PRAPATHAKA IV\n\n_\n\nThe Exposition Of the Soma Sacrifice (continued)\n\n_\n\n### vi. 4. 1.\n\nBy means of the sacrifice Prajapati created offspring; verily he created them\nby the subsidiary sacrifices; in that he offers the subsidiary sacrifices,\nverily thus the sacrificer creates offspring. He cuts off from the hind\nportion, for from the hind portion offspring are born; he cuts off from the\nthick side, for offspring are born from the thick side; he cuts off without\nconfusion, to prevent confusion of the vital airs. He does not turn (it)\nround; if he were to turn (it) round, disease would be likely to seize his\noffspring. \'Go to the ocean, hail!\' he says verily thus he produces seed [1].\n\'Go to the atmosphere, hail!\' he says; verily by means of the atmosphere he\nbegets offspring for him, for in accord with the atmosphere offspring are\nborn. \'Go to god Savitr, hail!\' he says; verily, instigated by Savitr, he\nbegets offspring for him. \'Go to day and night, hail!\' he says; verily by\nmeans of day and night he begets offspring for him, for in accord with day and\nnight offspring are born. \'Go to Mitra and Varuna, hail!\' he says [2]; verily\nhe bestows expiration and inspiration on offspring when born. \'Go to Soma,\nhail!\' he says, for offspring have Soma for their deity. \'Go to the sacrifice,\nhail!\' he says; verily he makes offspring fit for the sacrifice. \'Go to the\nmetres, hail!\' he says; the metres are cattle; verily he wins cattle. \'Go to\nthe sky and the earth, hail!\' he says; verily on either side he supports\noffspring when born with the sky and the earth. \'Go to the clouds [3] of the\nsky, hail!\' he says; verily he procures rain for offspring when born; \'Go to\nAgni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara, hail!\' he says; verily he establishes in this (world)\noffspring when born. He makes a portion of the vital airs, who makes a portion\nof the intestines; \'Give me mind and heart\', he says; verily he summons the\nvital airs according to their places. When the beast is offered, pain reaches\nits heart; it gathers round the heart-spit [4]. if he were to place the heart-\nspit on the earth, he would cause pain to the earth; if on the waters, he\nwould cause pain to the waters; he places it in the meeting-place of dry and\nwet, to appease both. He should think of whomsoever he hates; verily he causes\nhim pain.\n\n### vi. 4. 2.\n\nThe gods divided the sacrifice on the Agnidh\'s altar: of what was left over\nthey said, \'Let this remain here.\' That is why the Vasativari (waters) have\ntheir name. But in the morning they could not arrange (to divide it); they\nplaced it in the waters, they became the Vasativaris. He takes the\nVasativaris; the Vasativaris are the sacrifice; verily having taken from the\nbeginning the sacrifice he stays (with it). If the sun set, on one who has not\ntaken (the waters), his sacrifice would not be begun [1], and he would split\nthe sacrifice. He should either take waters with radiance in them, or having\ndeposited gold he takes them with light in them, or he should take them from\nthe tank of a Brahman who performs many sacrifices, for he is one who has\ntaken the Vasativaris. He takes the Vasativaris; the Vasativaris are cattle;\nverily having taken cattle from the beginning he stays (with them). If he were\nto take them along the stream, his cattle would be likely to wander from him;\nhe takes them standing against the stream; verily he obstructs cattle and\nseizes them for him. Indra [2] slew Vrtra; he died upon the waters; of them\nwhat was pure, fit for sacrifice, and divine, that was set free. They became\nthe Vahantis. He takes of the Vahantis; verily he takes those of waters which\nare pure, fit for sacrifice, and divine. He should not pass over the nearest\nVahantis; if he were to pass over the nearest Vahantis, he would despise the\nsacrifice. He should not take of stagnant (waters); the stagnant (waters) are\nseized by Varuna; if he were to take of stagnant (waters) [3], be would cause\nVaruna to seize his sacrifice. If it is done by day, the night enters the\nwaters; therefore the waters appear dusky by day; if it is done by night, the\nday enters the waters; therefore the waters appear shining by night; he takes\n(them) at the union of shade and light; verily for him he secures the colour\nof day and night. \'These waters are rich in oblation\', he says; verily he\ntakes them made into an oblation. \'Rich in oblation be [4] the sun\', be says;\nverily he takes them with light in them. He takes with an Anustubh; the\nAnustubh is speech; verily with the whole of speech he takes them. He takes\nwith a verse of four feet, he places them thrice, they make up seven, the\n\xc3\x87akvari has seven feet, the \xc3\x87akvari is cattle; verily he wins cattle. For this\nworld the Garhapatya is established, for yonder the Ahavaniya; if he were to\nplace (them) on the Garhapatya, he would have cattle in this world, if on the\nAhavaniya, in yonder [5] world he would have cattle. He places (them) on both;\nverily he makes him have cattle in both worlds. He carries (them) round\neverywhere, to smite away the Raksases. \'Ye are the share of Indra and Agni\',\nhe says; that is according to the text. He places (them) on the Agnidh\'s\naltar; the Agnidh\'s altar is the invincible part of the sacrifice; verily he\nplaces (them) on the invincible part of the sacrifice. Wherever in the\nperformance of a sacrifice nothing is done, in that (place) the Raksases\ninfest the sacrifice. In that he takes of the Vahantis, that part of the\nsacrifices lies being performed, to prevent the infestation of the Raksases,\nfor they do not move them, but they lie around until the third pressing, for\nthe continuity of the sacrifice.\n\n### vi. 4.3.\n\nThe theologians say, \'He indeed would be an Adhvaryu who in making Soma\ndescend should make it descend for all the gods.\' \'To the heart thee!\' he\nsays; verily he makes it for men; \'To mind thee!\' he says; verily he makes it\nfor the Pitrs; \'To the sky thee! To the sun thee!\' he says; verily he makes it\nfor the gods; so many are the gods; verily he makes it descend for them all.\nBefore the utterance of speech [1] he begins the morning litany; verily he\nwins all that there is of speech. \'The waters\' is the first thing he utters;\nthe waters are the sacrifice verily over the sacrifice he utters speech. He\nrecites all (kinds of) metres the metres are cattle; verily he wins cattle.\nFor one who desires brilliance he should conclude with a Gayatri verse, for\none who desires power with a Tristubh verse, for one who desires cattle with a\nJagati verse, for one who desires support with an Anustubh verse, for one who\ndesires the sacrifice with a Pankti verse, for one who desires food with a\nViraj verse. \'Let Agni (kindled) with the kindling-stick hear my appeal\', he\nsays [2]; verily, instigated by Savitr, having made proclamation to the gods,\nhe goes for the waters. \'O Hotr, give directions for the waters\', he says; for\nan action which is directed is done. \'O bowl priest of the Maitravaruna, run\nhither\'. he says; Mitra and Varuna are the leaders of the waters; verily with\nthem he goes for them. \'O ye divine waters, child of the water\', he says;\nverily by the oblation requiting them he seizes them: then he takes of them\nmade into an oblation and covered with ghee [3]. \'Thou art the dragger\', he\nsays; verily he removes dirt from them. \'I draw you for the sustenance of the\nocean\', he says; therefore the waters though eaten and drunk do not waste\naway. The pit is the birthplace of the sacrifice, the Vasairivaris are the\nsacrifice; bringing the bowls of the Hotr and the Maitravaruna into contact he\npours in the Vasativaris reciprocally, so that the sacrifice may have its\nbirthplace; verily he produces it from its own birthplace. \'O Adhvaryu, didst\nthou seek the waters?\' he says; \'they came to me; look upon them\', in effect\nhe says. If it is an Agnistoma, he makes a libation; if an Ukthya, he rubs\n(butter) on the enclosing-sticks; if it is an Atiratra, he goes forward\nuttering a text, to distinguish the sacrifices.\n\n### vi. 4. 4.\n\n\'On the instigation of god Savitr (with these words) he takes up the pressing-\nstone, for instigation, \'with the arms of the A\xc3\xa7vins\', he says; for the A\xc3\xa7vins\nwere the Adhvaryus of the gods; \'with the hands of Pusan\', he says, for\nsupport. The Soma is cattle, the Upan\xc3\xa7u pressing-(stone) is cross breathing;\nin that he measures round the Upan\xc3\xa7u pressing-(stone), he confers cross-\nbreathing upon cattle. \'To Indra thee! To Indra thee!\' (with these words) he\nmeasures, for the Soma is taken for Indra. Five times he measures with the\ntext [1]; the Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold, verily he\nwins the sacrifice. Five times (he measures) in silence; these make up ten;\nthe Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily he wins food by the\nViraj. \'Ye are savoury, conquerors of Vrtra\', he says; this is the Soma-\ndrinking of the waters; he who knows thus reaches not destruction in the\nwaters. \'With thy light which is in the sky\', he says; verily from these\nworlds he gathers him [2]. Soma, the king, reflected on the quarters, he\nentered the quarters; \'forward, behind, upward, downward\', he says, verily\nfrom the quarters he gathers him; verily also he wins the quarters for him. \'O\nmother, come forth\', he says; women are likely to desire him who knows thus.\n\'Thy unerring, watchful name, O Soma\', he says [3]; this is Soma\'s Soma-\ndrinking; he who knows thus reaches not destruction from Soma. When they press\nSoma they kill him; he keeps back shoots; verily he protects him. The shoots\nare the vital airs, Soma is cattle; he later lets go the shoots; verily he\nbestows vital airs upon cattle; two by two he lets them go; therefore the\nvital airs are in pairs.\n\n### vi. 4. 5.\n\nThe Upan\xc3\xa7u Cup is breath; in that the cups are drawn beginning with the\nUpan\xc3\xa7u, they follow on breath. Aruna Aupave\xc3\xa7i used to say, \'At the morning\npressing I establish the sacrifice and then I proceed with it when it has been\nestablished.\' He first presses eight times; the Gayatri has eight syllables,\nthe morning pressing is connected with the Gayatri; verily thereby he obtains\nthe morning pressing. (He presses) eleven times on the second occasion; the\nTristubh has eleven syllables, the midday pressing is connected with the\nTristubh [1]; verily thereby he obtains the midday pressing. (He presses)\ntwelve times on the third occasion; the Jagati has twelve syllables, the third\npressing is connected with the Jagati; verily thereby he obtains the third\npressing. This is what he calls the establishment of the sacrifice, to prevent\nloss; for what falls when the sacrifice is established is not lost. Or rather\nthey say, \'The Gayatri is not open to question\' at the morning pressing\'; he\nwho knows thus is not liable to question from his foe; therefore eight times\nin each case should press [2]. The theologians say, \'Other cups are drawn with\na strainer; what strainer has the Upan\xc3\xa7u?\' \'Speech is the strainer\', he should\nreply. \'Be pure for the lord of speech, O strong one\', he says; verily by\nspeech he purifies him. \'With the shoots of the male\', he says, for the shoots\nof the Soma are the shoots of the male; \'purified by the arms\', he says, for\nby the arms he purifies him; \'thou art the god, purifier of gods\', he says,\nfor he being a god [3] is the purifier of gods; \'to those thee whose portion\nthou art\', he says, for he draws him for those whose portion he is. \'Thou art\nhe who is appropriated\', he says; verily he makes breath his own; \'make our\nfood full of sweetness for us\', he says; verily he makes all food sweet for\nhim; \'to all the powers of sky and earth thee!\' he says; verily upon both gods\nand men he bestows the vital airs. \'May mind enter thee!\' he says [4]; verily\nhe attains mind. \'Fare along the broad atmosphere\', he says, for the breath\nhas the atmosphere as its deity. \'Hail! Thee, of kindly nature, to the sun!\'\nhe says; the gods of kindly nature are the breaths; verily in them he secretly\noffers. \'To the gods that drink the rays thee!\' he says; the gods that drink\nthe rays are the rays of the sun; that is their share; verily thereby he\ndelights them. If he desire, \'May Parjanya rain\' [5], he should rub (the cup)\nwith the (palm of) the hand downwards; verily he brings down the rain. If he\ndesire, \'May it not rain\', he should rub with the hand upwards; verily he\nkeeps up the rain. If he practise witchcraft, \'Slay N.N.; then will I\nsacrifice to thee\', he should say; verily desiring the libation he slays him.\nIf he be far away, he should stand until he is weary; verily he follows his\nbreath and slays him. If he practise witchcraft [6], he should put (it) down\n(with the words), \'I set thee down on the breath of N.N.\'; the breath is\nrestless; verily he brings his breath to rest. He purifies by means of six\nshoots; the seasons are six; verily he purifies him by means of the seasons;\nthrice he purifies these worlds are three; verily he purifies him by means of\nthese worlds. The theologians say, \'For what reason is it that three animals\ntake by the hand?\' In that thrice he draws separately the Upan\xc3\xa7u with his\nhand, therefore there are three animals which take by the hand, man, the\nelephant, and the ape.\n\n### vi. 4. 6.\n\nWhatever the gods did as the sacrifice, that the Asuras did. The gods saw that\nthe sacrifice must be established in the Upan\xc3\xa7u (cup), and they established it\nin the Upan\xc3\xa7u. The Asuras grasping the thunderbolt attacked the gods; the gods\nin fear ran up to Indra, Indra obstructed them\' by means of the Antaryama\n(cup), and that is why the Antaryama has its name, \'the obstructor\'. In that\nthe Antaryama cup is drawn, verily thus the sacrificer obstructs his foes.\n\'Through thee I interpose sky and earth [1], I interpose the broad\natmosphere\', he says; verily with these worlds the sacrificer obstructs his\nfoes. The gods reflected, \'Indra hath now become what we are\'; they said, \'O\nbounteous one, give us a share\'; \'In unison with the gods, the lower and the\nhigher\', he replied; to both (the sets of) gods, the lower and the higher [2],\nhe gave a share. \'In unison with the gods, the lower and the higher\', he says;\nto both (the sets of) gods, the lower and the higher, he gives a share. \'O\nbounteous one, do thou rejoice in the Antaryama\', he says; verily he does not\ncut off the sacrificer from the sacrifice. \'Thou art taken with a support\', he\nsays, for the support of inspiration. If both (cups) were drawn without a\nfilter, inspiration would follow expiration, he would be likely to die. The\nAntaryama is drawn with a filter [3], to separate expiration and inspiration.\nThe Upan\xc3\xa7u and the Antaryama (cups) are expiration and inspiration, the Upan\xc3\xa7u\npressing-(stone) is cross-breathing. If he desire of a man, \'May he be likely\nto die\', he should set them down for him without being in contact; verily he\nsevers his expiration and inspiration from cross-breathing; swiftly he dies.\nIf he desire of a man, \'May he live all his days\', he should set them down for\nhim in contact; verily he connects his expiration and inspiration with cross-\nbreathing; he lives all his days.\n\n### vi. 4. 7.\n\nThe cup for Indra and Vayu is speech; in that the cups are drawn beginning\nwith that to Indra and Vayu, verily they follow speech. The gods said to Vayu,\n\'Let us slay Soma, the king\'; he replied, \'Let me choose a boon; let your cups\nbe drawn with mine first.\' Therefore the cups are drawn with those for Indra\nand Vayu first. They slew him; he became putrid; the gods could not endure\nhim, they said to Vayu, \'Make him sweet for us\' [1]; he replied, \'Let me\nchoose a boon; let your vessels, be said to have me as their deity.\'\nTherefore, being of various deities, they are said to have Vayu as their\ndeity. Verily did Vayu make him sweet for him; therefore what becomes putrid\nthey hang out in a windy place, for Vayu is its purifier, its sweetener. They\ncould not find its distribution; Aditi said, \'Let me choose a boon; then shall\nye distribute through me, verily with me as deity may your Soma (draughts) be\nset down\' [2]. \'Thou art taken with a support\', he says, and thereby have they\nAditi for their deity, for those vessels that are made of wood are born from\nher womb, those that are made of clay are clearly hers; therefore he says\nthus. Speech aforetime spoke without discrimination; the gods said to Indra,\n\'Do thou discriminate this speech for us\'; he replied, \'Let me choose a boon;\nlet this (cup) be drawn for me and for Vayu together.\' Therefore the cup is\ndrawn together for Indra and Vayu. Indra approaching it in the midst\ndiscriminated it; therefore is speech spoken distinctly. Therefore is it drawn\nonce, in the middle, for Indra, and twice for Vayu, for he chose two boons.\n\n### vi. 4. 8.\n\nThe gods said to Mitra, \'Let us slay Soma, the king\'; he replied, \'Not I; for\nI am the friend of all\'; they answered, \'Still we will slay him\'; he replied,\n\'Let me choose a boon; let them mix the Soma for me with milk.\' Therefore they\nmix with milk (the Soma) for Mitra and Varuna. From him cattle departed\n(saying), \'He that was a friend hath done a cruel deed\'; a cruel deed as it\nwere [1] does he do who sacrifices with Soma; from him cattle depart. In that\nhe mixes with milk (the Soma) for Mitra and Varuna, he unites Mitra with\ncattle, and the sacrificer with cattle. Aforetime indeed was Mitra thus\naware,\' When I have done this cruel deed, cattle will depart from me\';\ntherefore he chose thus. The gods said to Varuna, \'With thee as helper we will\nslay Soma, the king\'; he replied, \'Let me choose a boon, for me [2] and Mitra\ntogether let this (cup) be drawn.\' Therefore it is drawn for Mitra and Varuna\ntogether; therefore with a king as helper they slay a king, with a Vai\xc3\xa7ya a\nVai\xc3\xa7ya, with a \xc3\x87udra a \xc3\x87udra. This was not day or night, but undiscriminated;\nthe gods said to Mitra and Varuna, \'Make this to shine forth for us\'; they\nreplied, \'Let us choose a boon; let one cup only be drawn before ours.\'\nTherefore the cup for Indra and Vayu is drawn before that for Mitra and\nVaruna, for the Upan\xc3\xa7u and the Antaryama (cups) are expiration and\ninspiration. Mitra produced the day, Varuna the night; then indeed did this\nshine forth; in that (a cup) is drawn for Mitra and Varuna, (it is) for\nshining forth.\n\n### vi. 4. 9.\n\nThe head of the sacrifice was cut; the gods said to the A\xc3\xa7vins, Ye are\nphysicians; do ye replace the head of the sacrifice\', they replied. Let us\nchoose a boon; let there be drawn a cup for us also herein.\' For them they\ndrew this cup for the A\xc3\xa7vins; then indeed did they replace the head of the\nsacrifice; in that (the cup) for the A\xc3\xa7vins is drawn, (it is) to restore the\nsacrifice. The gods said of these two, \'Impure are they, wandering among men\n[1] and physicians.\' Therefore a Brahman should not practise medicine, for the\nphysician is impure, unfit for the sacrifice. Having purified them by the\nBahispavamana (Stotra) they drew for them this cup for the A\xc3\xa7vins; therefore\n(the cup) for the A\xc3\xa7vins is drawn when the Bahispavamana has been sung.\nTherefore by one who knows thus the Bahispavamana should be performed; verily\nhe purifies himself. Their skill as physicians they deposited in three places,\nin Agni a third, in the waters a third, in the Brahman a third. Therefore one\nshould put beside him a pot of water [2] and sit on the right hand of a\nBrahman when practising medicine; all medicine he performs thereby, his remedy\nbecomes effective. The theologians say, \'For what reason are cups for two\ndeities drawn in one vessel, but offered in two?\' In that (the cups) are drawn\nin one vessel, therefore there is one breath within; they are offered in two\nvessels, therefore the breaths outside are in pairs. Those that are for two\ndeities are the breaths, the Ida is cattle; if he should summon the Ida before\nthose that are for two deities [3], he would obstruct his breaths by cattle,\nhe would be likely to perish. Having eaten those for two deities, he summons\nthe Ida; verily having placed the breaths in himself he summons the Ida. (The\ncup) for Indra and Vayu is speech, that for Mitra and Varuna is the eye, that\nfor the A\xc3\xa7vins is the ear; he eats in front that for Indra and Vayu, therefore\nin front he speaks with speech; in front that for Mitra and Varuna, therefore\nin front he sees with the eye; moving all round, that for the A\xc3\xa7vins;\ntherefore on all sides he hears with the ear. Those for two deities are the\nbreaths [4], he sets down full vessels; therefore the breaths are full within;\nwherever in the performance of the sacrifice nothing is done, in that place\nthe Raksases attack the sacrifice; in that he sets down full vessels the part\nof the sacrifice being performed is deposited to prevent the entry of the\nRaksases. He sets down in the north track of the southern oblation-cart;\nverily he places speech in speech. They lie (there) until the third pressing,\nfor the continuity of the sacrifice.\n\n### vi. 4. 10.\n\nBrhaspati was the Purohita of the gods, \xc3\x87anda and Marka of the Asuras; the\ngods had the holy power (Brahman), the Asuras had the holy power (Brahman);\nthey could not overcome one another; the gods invited \xc3\x87anda and Marka; they\nreplied, \'Let us choose a boon; let cups be drawn for us also herein.\' For\nthem they drew these cups for \xc3\x87ukra and Manthin; then did the gods prosper,\nthe Asuras were defeated. He for whom knowing thus these \xc3\x87ukra and Manthin\n(cups) are drawn, prospers himself, his foe [1] is defeated. Having driven\naway these two, the gods offered to themselves,\' to Indra. \'Driven away are\n\xc3\x87anda and Marka together with N.N.\', he should say of whom he hates; with him\nwhom he hates he thus drives them away. \'This is the first preparer, all\nmaker\', (with these words) they offered to themselves, to Indra, these (cups),\nfor Indra kept making these forms. The \xc3\x87ukra is yonder sun, the Manthin is the\nmoon; they depart towards the east, closing their eyes [2]; therefore men do\nnot see them as they go east. Turning back towards the west they sacrifice,\ntherefore men see them going west. The \xc3\x87ukra and the Manthin are the eyes of\nthe sacrifice, the high altar is the nose. They offer having gone round (the\naltar) on both sides; therefore the eyes are on either side of the nose;\ntherefore the eyes are held apart by the nose; they walk round on all sides,\nto smite away the Raksases. Now the offerings the gods made on the east, with\nthem they drove away the Asuras who were in front [3]; with those on the west\nthey drove away the Asuras who were behind; other sacrifices are made in the\neast, the \xc3\x87ukra and Manthin on the west; verily behind and in front the\nsacrificer drives away his foes; therefore offspring are engendered behind and\nare brought forth in front. In accordance with the \xc3\x87ukra and Manthin are\noffspring born, the eaters and the eaten. \'Engendering heroic off spring),\ncome forth, \xc3\x87ukra, with pure radiance\' [4], \'Engendering prolific offspring,\ncome forth, Manthin, with mixed radiance\', he says; \'the eaters are those who\nare heroic, the eaten those that are prolific. The offspring of him who knows\nthus becomes an eater, not eaten. The eye of Prajapati swelled; it fell away,\nit entered the Vikankata, it did not stay in the Vikankata; it entered barley,\nit stayed in barley; that is why barley has its name [5]. In that the Manthin\nvessel is of Vikankata and he mixes with groats, verily thus he gathers\ntogether the eye of Prajapati. The theologians say, \'For what reason does the\nManthin vessel not go to the Sadas?\' \'It is the vessel of misfortune\', he\nshould say; if it were to go there, the Adhvaryu would be blind, he would be\nruined; therefore it does not go there.\n\n### vi. 4. 11.\n\nWhatever the gods did at the sacrifice the Asuras did. The gods saw the cups\nwith the Agrayana at their head; they drew them; then indeed did they reach\nthe top; he for whom knowing thus the cups are drawn with the Agrayana at\ntheir head reaches the top of his equals. With a verse containing the word\n\'destructive\' he should draw for him who has a rival; verily having destroyed\nhis rival he reaches the top of his equals. \'Ye gods that are eleven in the\nsky\', he says [1]; so many are the deities; verily he draws it for all of\nthem. \'This is thy birthplace; to the All-gods thee!\' he says, for it has the\nAll-gods for its deity. Speech departed from the gods, not being willing to\nremain for the sacrifice; when speech had departed the gods silently drew the\ncups; speech reflected, \'They are excluding me\'; it went into the Agrayana;\nthat is why the Agrayana has its name [2]. Therefore in the Agrayana speech is\nuttered. In that the former cups are drawn in silence, that is as when the\nhunter lets go (his arrow), (thinking), \'So far off is my mark at so far I\nshall not miss.\' The Adhvaryu taking the Agrayana, commencing the sacrifice,\nutters his speech; thrice he utters \'Him\'; verily thus he chooses the Udgatrs;\nthe Agrayana is Prajapati; in that he utters \'Him\' after taking the Agrayana,\nverily thus Prajapati sniffs offspring [3]; therefore the cow sniffs the calf\non birth. The Agrayana is the self of the sacrifice; at each pressing he draws\nit; verily he continues the sacrifice in itself. He brings (it) up from above\nverily thus he impregnates seed; he takes (it) from below verily he generates\nit. The theologians say, \'For what reason does the Gayatri, the least of the\nmetres, support the pressings?\' \'The Agrayana is the calf of the Gayatri;\nverily turning back towards it it supports all the pressings. Therefore a cow\nturns back towards the calf which is taken away.\n\n## PRAPATHAKA V\n\n_\n\nThe Exposition of the Soma Sacrifice (continued)\n\n_\n\n### vi. 5. 1.\n\nIndra raised his bolt to hurl at Vrtra; Vrtra was afraid of the bolt when\nraised to be hurled; he said, \'Hurl it not at me; there is this strength in\nme, that will I bestow on thee\'; on him he bestowed the Ukthya. At him he\nraised (the bolt) to hurl a second time; he said, \'Hurl it not at me; there is\nthis strength in me, that will I bestow on thee\' [1]; on him he bestowed again\nthe Ukthya. At him he raised (the bolt) to hurl a third time; Visnu supported\nhim (saying), \'Smite\'; he said, \'Hurl it not at me; there is this strength in\nme, that will I bestow on thee\'; he bestowed on him again the Ukthya. Him when\nhe had lost his magic power he slew, for the sacrifice was his magic power. In\nthat the Ukthya is drawn, verily the sacrificer thus appropriates the power\n[2] and strength of his foe. \'To Indra thee, to him of the Brhat, the strong\',\nhe says, for to Indra he gave it; \'to him thee! To Visnu thee!\' he says; in\nthat Visnu supported him (saying), \'Strike\', he gives Visnu a share therein.\nThrice he draws, for thrice he gave to him., This is thy birthplace; thou art\nthe renewed offering\', he says, for repeatedly [3] he draws from it. The\nUkthya is the eye of the sacrifice; therefore the Somas follow the Ukthya when\noffered; therefore the body follows the eye; therefore as one goes many\nfollow; therefore one becomes superior among many; therefore one wins many\nwives. If the Adhvaryu desire, \'May I bestow upon myself the glory of the\nsacrifice\', standing between the Ahavaniya and the oblation-holder he should\npour (it) down [4]; verily he bestows upon himself the glory of the sacrifice.\nIf he desire, \'May I bestow upon the sacrificer the glory of the sacrifice\',\nhe should pour (it) down standing between the Sadas and the oblation-holder;\nverily he bestows upon the sacrificer the glory of the sacrifice. If he\ndesire, \'May I bestow upon the Sadasyas the glory of the sacrifice\', he should\npour (it) down, grasping the Sadas; verily he bestows upon the Sadasyas the\nglory of the sacrifice.\n\n### vi. 5. 2.\n\nThe Dhruva (cup) is the life of the sacrifice; it is drawn the last of the\ncups; therefore life is the last of the breaths. \'The head of the sky, the\nmessenger of earth\', he says; verily he makes him the head of his equals.\n\'Vai\xc3\xa7vanara, born for holy order\', he says, for life has Vai\xc3\xa7vanara as its\ndeity. It is drawn with Vai\xc3\xa7vanara on both sides; therefore there are breaths\non both sides, below and above. The other cups that are drawn make a half, the\nDhruva makes a half; therefore [1] the breath below is a half of the other\nbreaths. The other cups are deposited on strewn (ground), the Dhruva on\nunstrewn; therefore in bone some creatures find support, in flesh others. The\nAsuras from above desired to turn round the earth; the gods made it firm (\n_adrnhan_ ) with the Dhruva; that is why the Dhruva has its name; in that the\nDhruva is set down from above, (it serves) for firmness. The Dhruva is the\nlife of the sacrifice, the Hotr is the body; in that he pours the Dhruva down\ninto the goblet of the Hotr, so he places life in the body of the sacrifice\n[2]. \'Before the Uktha it should be poured down\', they say, for in front one\nenjoys life; \'In the middle it should be poured down\', they say, for the\nmiddle one enjoys life; \'In the latter part it should be poured down\', they\nsay, for with the last one enjoys life. He pours (it) down while the verse to\nthe All-gods is being recited; offspring are connected with the All-gods;\nverily he confers life upon offspring.\n\n### vi. 5. 3.\n\nBy means of the sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven; they\nreflected, \'Men will follow after us here\'; they blocked (the way) by the year\nand went to the world of heaven. It the Rsis discerned by means of the season-\ncups; in that the season-cups are drawn, (they serve) to reveal, the world of\nheaven. Twelve are drawn; the year consists of twelve months; (verily they\nserve) to reveal the year. The first two are drawn together, the last two\ntogether; therefore the seasons are in pairs. The season-vessel has mouths on\nboth sides, for who [1] knows where is the mouth of the seasons? \'Give\ndirections for the season\', six times he says,\' the seasons are six; verily he\ndelights the seasons; \'For the seasons\', four times; verily he delights four-\nfooted cattle; twice again he says, \'For the season\'; verily he delights two-\nfooted (cattle). \'Give directions for the season\', six times he says; \'For the\nseasons\', four times; therefore four-footed cattle depend upon the seasons;\ntwice [2] again, \'For the season\', he says; therefore bipeds live upon\nquadrupeds. \'Give directions for the season\', six times he says; \'For the\nseasons\', four times; twice again, \'For the season\'; verily the sacrificer\nmakes himself a ladder and bridge to attain the world of heaven. One should\nnot follow the other; if one were to follow the other, season would follow\nseason, the seasons would be confused [3]; therefore in order the Adhvaryu\nsets out by the southern (door), the Pratiprasthatr by the northern; therefore\nthe sun goes south for six months, north for six months.\' \'Thou art taken with\na support; thou art Samsarpa; to Anhaspatya thee!\' he says; \'There is a\nthirteenth month\', they say; verily he delights it.\n\n### vi. 5. 4.\n\nThe season-cups are drawn for the world of heaven; Indra and Agni are the\nlight; in that he draws the cup for Indra and Agni with the season-vessel,\nverily he places light above it, to light up the world of heaven. Indra and\nAgni are the bearers of force among the gods; in that (the cup) for Indra and\nAgni is drawn, verily he wins force. He draws (the cup) for the All-gods with\nthe \xc3\x87ukra-vessel; people are connected with the All-gods, the \xc3\x87ukra is yonder\nsun, in that he draws (the cup) for the All-gods with the \xc3\x87ukra-vessel, yonder\nsun [1] rises turned to all people; therefore each one thinks, \'Towards me\nhath it arisen.\' He draws (the cup) for the All-gods with the \xc3\x87ukra-vessel;\npeople are connected with the All-gods, the \xc3\x87ukra is brilliance; in that he\ndraws (the cup) for the All-gods with the \xc3\x87ukra vessel, verily he bestows\nbrilliance upon people.\n\n### vi. 5. 5.\n\nIndra in league with the Maruts slew Vrtra at the midday pressing; in that\n(the cups) for the Maruts are drawn at the midday pressing, they are drawn for\nthe sacrificer as slaying the foe. Of him, when he had slain Vrtra, the\nseasons were confused; with the season vessel he drew (the cups) for the\nMaruts; then indeed did he discern the seasons; in that (the cups) for the\nMaruts are drawn with the season-vessel, (they serve) to reveal the seasons.\n(The cups) for the Maruts are a weapon which the sacrificer hurls at his foe;\nwith the first [1] he raises it aloft, with the second he hurls it; with the\nthird he lays (him) low. (The cups) for the Maruts are a weapon which the\nsacrificer makes ready; the first is a bow, the second a bowstring, the third\nan arrow; with the first he fits the arrow, with the second he lets it go,\nwith the third he pierces. Indra having slain Vrtra went to the furthest\ndistance, thinking, \'I have done amiss\'; he became of bay colour, he saw these\n(cups) for the Maruts, to save himself;\' he drew them [2]; verily with the\nfirst he won expiration, with the second inspiration, himself with the third,\n(the cups) for the Maruts are drawn to save the self of the sacrificer; verily\nhe wins expiration with the first, inspiration by the second, and himself with\nthe third. Indra slew Vrtra; the gods said of him, \'Great hath he become who\nhath slain Vrtra\'; that is why Mahendra (great Indra) has his name. He drew\nthis libation for Mahendra, having slain Vrtra and being above the other\ndeities; in that (the cup) for Mahendra is drawn, so the sacrificer draws this\nlibation, being above other people. He draws with the \xc3\x87ukra vessel; (the cup)\nfor Mahendra has the sacrificer as its deity, the \xc3\x87ukra is brilliance; in that\nhe draws (the cup) for Mahendra in the \xc3\x87ukra-vessel, verily he bestows\nbrilliance on the sacrificer.\n\n### vi. 5. 6.\n\nAditi, desirous of offspring, cooked a Brahman\'s mess for the Sadhya gods; to\nher the gave the remains, she ate it, she became pregnant; of her the four\nAdityas were born. A second (mess) she cooked; she reflected, \'They have been\nborn for me from the remains; if I eat first, then stronger ones will be born\nfrom me\'; she ate first, she became pregnant, from her was born an egg which\nmiscarried. She cooked a third (mess) for the Adityas [1], (saying) \'Let this\nlabour be for enjoyment to me\'; they said, \'Let us choose a boon; let him who\nshall be born hence be one of us; let him who shall be prosperous among his\noffspring be for our enjoyment\'; then was born the Aditya Vivasvant, men are\nhis offspring here, among them he alone is successful who sacrifices, he\nserves for enjoyment of the gods. The gods kept Rudra away from the sacrifice\n[2], he followed the Adityas; they took refuge in (the cups) for two deities,\nthem they did not give up; therefore men do not give up even one worthy of\ndeath who has come for help. Therefore (the cup) for the Adityas is drawn from\nthose for two deities, in that they were born from the remnant, therefore it\nis drawn from the remnant. He draws with three verses; mother, father, son,\nverily that is this pairing; the amnion, embryo, the chorion, verily that is\nthis [3] pairing. The Aditya (cup) is cattle; curds are strength; he mixes\nwith curds in the middle; verily he places strength in the middle of cattle;\n(with curds) to be coagulated with boiled milk, for purity. Therefore the raw\nmilks the cooked. The Aditya (cup) is cattle; he-draws after covering (the\ncup); verily he draws securing cattle for him. The Aditya (cup) is those\ncattle; Agni is Rudra here; he draws after covering; verily he shuts off\ncattle from Rudra [4]. (The stone) for pressing out the Upan\xc3\xa7u (cup) is this\nAditya Vivasvant; it lies round this Soma drink until the third pressing. \'O\nbright Aditya, this is thy Soma drink\', he says; verily he unites the Aditya\nVivasvant with the Soma drink. \'With the rain of the sky I mix thee\', (with\nthese words) he should mix for one who desires rain; verily he wins rain. If\nit should fall quickly, Parjanya would be likely to rain; if long, (he would)\nnot (be likely). He does not place (the cup) down, for from that which is not\ndepressed offspring are produced. He should not utter the secondary Vasat; if\nhe were to do so, he would let Rudra go after his offspring; after sacrificing\nhe should not look after (it); if he were to look after (it) his eye would be\nlikely to be destroyed; therefore he should not look after (it).\n\n### vi. 5. 7.\n\nHe draws (the cup) for Savitr from the Agrayana with the Antaryama-vessel; the\nAgrayana is Prajapati; (verily it serves) for the begetting of offspring. He\ndoes not place (the cup) down, for from that which is not depressed offspring\nare produced. He does -not utter the secondary Vasat; if he were to do so, he\nwould let Rudra go after his offspring. Savitr is among the gods he who is\nconnected with the Gayatri; in that the Agrayana (is drawn), it is drawn in\nthe world of the Gayatri; in that he draws (the cup) for Savitr from the\nAgrayana with the Antaryama vessel, verily he draws it off from its own\nbirthplace. The All-gods [1] could not perform the third pressing; they led\nSavitr who shares in the first pressing to the third pressing; then indeed\nthey performed the third pressing. In that (the cup) for Savitr is drawn at\nthe third pressing, (it serves) for performing the third pressing. He draws\n(the cup) for the All-gods from the tub with the Savitr-vessel; people are\nconnected with the All-gods, the tub is connected with the All-gods, Savitr\nrules instigations; in that he draws (the cup) for the All-gods from the tub\nwith the Savitr vessel, verily instigated by Savitr he produces offspring for\nhim [2]. He draws Soma in Soma; verily thus he impregnates seed. \'Thou givest\ngood protection, and art well established\', he says, for he draws Soma in\nSoma, for support. In this same cup (offering) is made for men, gods, and\nPitrs; \'Thou givest good protection, and art well established\', he says;\nverily thereby he makes (it) for men; \'The great\', he says; verily thereby he\nmakes (it) for the gods; \'Homage\', he says; verily thereby he makes (it) for\nthe Pitrs; so many are the gods; verily he draws it for them all. \'This is thy\nbirthplace; to the All-gods thee!\' he says, for it is connected with the All-\ngods.\n\n### vi. 5. 8.\n\nThe Upan\xc3\xa7u is the breath; in that the first and the, last cups are drawn with\nthe Upan\xc3\xa7u-vessel, verily they follow forward the breath, they follow back the\nbreath. The Agrayana is Prajapati, the Upan\xc3\xa7u is the breath, the wives produce\noffspring; in that he draws (the cup) for (Tvastr) with the wives from the\nAgrayana with the Upan\xc3\xa7u-vessel, (it serves) for the production of offspring.\nTherefore offspring are born in accordance with the breath. The gods desired\nthat the wives should go to the world of heaven [1]; they could not discern\nthe world of heaven, they saw this (cup) for the wives, they drew it; then\nindeed did they discern the world of heaven; in that (the cup) for the wives\nis drawn, (it serves) to reveal the world of heaven. Soma could not bear being\ndrawn for women; making the ghee a bolt they beat it, they drew it when it had\nlost its power; therefore women are powerless, have no inheritance, and speak\nmore humbly than even a bad man [2]. In that he mixes (the cup) for (Tvastr)\nwith the wives with ghee, he overpowers it with a bolt and draws it. \'Thou art\ntaken with a support\', he says; the support is this (earth); therefore\noffspring are born on this (earth). \'Of thee, pressed by Brhaspati \', he says;\nBrhaspati is the holy power of the gods; verily by the holy power he produces\noffspring for him. \'O drop\', he says; the drop is seed; verily thus he\nimpregnates seed. \'Possessing power\', he says [3]; power is offspring; verily\nhe produces offspring for him. \'O Agni\', he says; the impregnator of seed is\nAgni; \'With the wives\', he says, for pairing; \'in unison with the god Tvastr\ndrink the Soma\', he says; Tvastr is the maker of the forms of pairings of\nanimals; verily he places form in animals. The gods sought to slay Tvastr; he\nwent to the wives, they would not give him up; therefore [4] men do not give\nup even one worthy of death who has come for help. Therefore in (the cup) for\nthe wives for Tvastr also a drawing is made. He does not put (the cup) down,\nfor from what is not depressed offspring are produced. He does not utter the\nsecondary Vasat; if he were to do so, he would let Rudra go after his\noffspring; if he were not to do so, the Agnidh would consume the Soma before\nit had been appeased; he says the secondary Vasat muttering, he does not let\nRudra go after his offspring, the Agnidh consumes the Soma after it has been\nappeased. \'O Agnidh, sit on the lap of the Nestr; O Nestr, lead up the wife\',\nhe says verily the Agnidh impregnates the Nestr, the Nestr the wife. He causes\nthe Udgatr to look (at the wife); the Udgatr is Prajapati; (verily it serves)\nfor the production of offspring. He causes water to follow along; verily thus\nhe pours seed; along the thigh he causes it to flow, for along the thigh is\nseed poured; baring the thigh he causes it to flow, for when the thigh is\nbared, they pair, then seed is poured, then offspring are born.\n\n### vi. 5. 9.\n\nIndra slew Vrtra; he forced out his skull-bone, it became the wooden tub, from\nit the Soma flowed, it became (the cup) for the yoker of bays; he reflected\nregarding it, \'Shall I offer, or shall I not offer?\' He reflected, \'If I shall\noffer, I shall offer what is raw; if I shall not offer, I shall make confusion\nin the sacrifice.\' He decided to offer; Agni said, Thou shalt not offer what\nis raw in me\'; he mixed it with fried grains [1], and when it had become\ncooked he offered it. In that he mixes (the cup) for the yoker of bays with\nfried grains, (it serves) to make it cooked; verily he offers it when it has\nbecome cooked. He mixes with many; so many are his (cows) yielding his wishes\nin yonder world. Or rather they say,\'(The fried grains) for the yoker of bays\nare the dappled (cows) of Indra yielding wishes\'; therefore he should mix with\nmany. The bays of Indra, which drink the Soma, are the Rc and the Saman, the\nenclosing-sticks are their bridles; if he should offer without removing the\nenclosing-sticks, he would offer fodder to them still bridled [2]; he offers\nafter removing the enclosing-sticks; verily he offers fodder to them with\ntheir bridles removed. It is the Unnetr who offers; the Adhvaryu when he has\nuttered \'Godspeed!\' is as one who has finished his journey; if the Adhvaryu\nwere to offer, it would be as when one yokes again (a horse) unyoked. He\noffers after putting it on his head, for from the head it sprung; he offers\nafter striding, for Indra slew Vrtra after striding; (verily it serves) for\nattainment. (The grains) for the yoker of bays are cattle; if he were to crush\n(them), few [3] cattle would attend and wait on him; if he were not to crush\nthem, many cattle would attend, but not wait on him; in his mind he crushes\nthem together, and effects both; many cattle attend and wait on him. They\nawait the invitation from the Unnetr; verily they win the Soma-drinking that\nis here. He throws down (the remnants) on the high altar; the high altar is\ncattle, (the grains) for the yoker of bays are cattle verily they make cattle\nfind support in cattle.\n\n### vi. 5. 10.\n\nOffspring and cattle are born through the cups, goats and sheep through the\nUpan\xc3\xa7u and Antaryama, men through the \xc3\x87ukra and Manthin, whole-hooved animals\nthrough the season-cups, kine through the Aditya cup. The Aditya cup is drawn\nwith the largest number of Rcs; therefore kine axe the most numerous of\ncattle; in that he thrice draws apart with his hand the Upan\xc3\xa7u (cup),\ntherefore the female goat gives birth to two or three, but sheep are more\nnumerous. The Agrayana is the father, the tub is the son; if the Agrayana is\nexhausted, he should draw from the tub; that is as when a father [1] in\ndestitution has recourse to his son. If the tub is exhausted, he should draw\nfrom the Agrayana; that is as when a son in destitution has recourse to his\nfather. The Agrayana is the self of the sacrifice; if the cup or the tub\nshould be exhausted, he should draw from the Agrayana; verily from the self he\ndevelops the sacrifice. The Agrayana is drawn (with a verse) in which there is\nno discriminating mark; he draws with a pot, he offers with (the vessel) for\nVayu; therefore [2] (a man) is a slayer of a Brahman (through slaying) an\nembryo which has not been discriminated. They go to the final bath; they\ndeposit the pots, but lift up (the vessels) for Vayu; therefore they deposit a\ndaughter on birth, a son they lift up. In that be utters the Puroruc, it is as\nwhen one brings (something) to a superior; in that he draws the cup, it is as\nwhen having brought (something) to a superior one proclaims (it); in that he\nputs it down, it is as when having deposited something with a superior one\ngoes away. Whatever of the sacrifice is accompanied by a Saman or Yajus, is\nloose; whatever by a Rc is firm; they are drawn with a support in front to the\naccompaniment of a Yajus, (they are drawn) with a support behind to the\naccompaniment of a Rc, for the support of the sacrifice.\n\n### vi. 5. 11.\n\nSome vessels are used (repeatedly), others not. With those that are employed\nonce only ( _parac inani_) he conquers yonder world, for yonder world is as it\nwere turned away ( _paran_ ). With those which are used again he conquers this\nworld, for this world is repeated as it were again and again. Some vessels are\nused (repeatedly), and others not. Through those that are used once only the\nplants fade; through those which are used again [1] the plants revive again.\nSome vessels are used repeatedly, others not. Through those which are used\nonce only the wild animals go to the forest; through those which are used\nagain the domestic animals come back again to the village. He who knows the\nfoundation of the cups becomes possessed of a (sure) foundation. The hymn\ncalled the Ajya (\xc3\x87astra), that is the foundation of the cups; in that he\nrecites muttering, that [2] is (the foundation) of the Upan\xc3\xa7u and the\nAntaryama (cups); in that (he recites) aloud, that is (the foundation) of the\nother cups; he who knows thus becomes possessed of a foundation. He who knows\nthe pairing of the cups is propagated with offspring, with cattle, with\npairings. Some cups are drawn with pots, some with (vessels) for Vayu; that is\nthe pairing of the cups. He who knows thus is propagated with offspring, with\ncattle, with pairings. Indra forcibly drank the Soma of Tvastr; he went to\npieces on all sides [3]; he found no stay in himself; he saw these cakes ,as\nan addition to the pressing, them he offered, and with them he made a stay in\nhimself; therefore as additional to the pressing the cakes are offered;\ntherefore as additional to the pressing he should partake of the cakes; verily\nhe makes a stay in himself, and the Soma does not flow through him. The\ntheologians say, \'Neither by Rc nor by Saman is the five made up; what then is\nthe fivefold character of the sacrifice?\' Fried grains, mush, rice grains, the\ncake, clotted milk, thereby the five is made up; that is the fivefold\ncharacter of the sacrifice.\n\n## PRAPATHAKA VI\n\n_\n\nThe Exposition of the Daksina and other Offerings\n\n_\n\n### vi. 6. 1.\n\nThe sacrifices with the gifts are offered for the world of heaven. He offers\nwith two (verses) on the Garhapatya; the sacrificer has two feet; (verily it\nserves) for support. He offers in the Agnidh\'s altar; verily he ascends the\natmosphere. He approaches the Sadas; verily he makes him go to the world of\nheaven. He offers in the Garhapatya with verses addressed to Surya; verily he\nmakes him mount yonder world. He offers in the Agnidh\'s altar with a verse\ncontaining the word \'Lead\', for leading to the world of heaven. \'Go to the\nsky, fly to heaven\', (with these words) he takes out the gold after the\noffering [1]; verily he makes him go to the world of heaven. \'With my form I\napproach your form\', he says; for by his form he approaches their form, in\nthat (he approaches) with gold. \'May Tutha, all knowing, allot to you\', he\nsays; Tutha, all knowing, was wont to allot the gifts of the gods; verily\nthereby he divides them. \'This gift of thine, O Agni [2], cometh, impelled by\nthe Soma\', he says, for his gift comes impelled by the Soma. \'Lead it by the\npath of Mitra\', he says, for atonement. \'Go ye on by the path of holy order,\nof brilliant gifts\', he says; holy order is truth; verily with truth, with\nholy order, he divides them. \'Leading prosperity by the path of the\nsacrifice\', he says, for the gifts go by the path of the sacrifice. \'May I win\na Brahman to-day [3], a seer and sprung from seers\', he says; the learned man\nis a Brahman, a seer and sprung from seers; therefore he says thus. \'Gaze on\nthe heaven, gaze on the atmosphere\', he says; verily he makes him go to the\nworld of\' heaven. \'Join those in the seat\', he says, for friendship. \'Given by\nus, go to the gods, full of sweetness; enter the giver\', he says; \'we here are\ngivers; do ye there enter us, full of sweetness\' [4], he says in effect. He\ngives gold; gold is light; verily he places light before, to light up the\nworld of heaven. He gives to the Agnidh; verily he delights the seasons headed\nby Agni; he gives to the Brahman priest, for instigation; he gives to the\nHotr; the Hotr is the self of the sacrifice; verily he unites the self of the\nsacrifice with the gifts.\n\n### vi. 6. 2.\n\nHe offers the Samistayajuses, for the completion of the sacrifice. Whatever is\nharsh or injured in the sacrifice, what he passes over, what he does not pass\nover, what he does redundantly, what he does not do, all that he propitiates\nwith them. He offers nine; nine are the breaths in man, the sacrifice is\ncommensurate with man; all the sacrifice he delights thus. He offers six with\nRcs; the seasons are six; verily he delights the seasons; he offers three with\nYajuses [1]; these worlds are three; verily he delights these worlds. \'O\nsacrifice, go to the sacrifice; go to the lord of the sacrifice\', he says;\nverily he makes it go to the lord of the sacrifice. \'Go to thine own\nbirthplace\', he says; verily be makes it go to his own birthplace. \'This is\nthy sacrifice, O lord of the sacrifice, with its, utterance of hymns and\nproducing noble heroes\', he says; verily he confers strength upon the\nsacrificer. Vasistha Satyahavya asked Devabhaga, \'When thou didst cause to\nsacrifice the Sr\xc3\xb1jayas, with many sacrificers, didst thou cause the sacrifice\nto rest upon the sacrifice [2] or on the lord of the sacrifice? He replied,\n\'On the lord of the sacrifice.\' \'But in truth Sr\xc3\xb1jayas have been defeated\', he\nsaid, \'the sacrifice should have been made to rest on the sacrifice, to\nprevent the defeat of the sacrificer.\' \'Ye gods, that find the way, finding\nthe way, go on the way\', he says; verily he makes the sacrifice to rest upon\nthe sacrifice, to prevent the defeat of the sacrificer.\n\n### vi. 6. 3.\n\nHe offers the Avabhrthayajuses; whatever sin he has committed in the year\nbefore, verily that thereby he propitiates. He goes to the waters for the\nfinal bath; Varuna is in the waters; verily straightway he propitiates Varuna.\nThe Raksases, following along by the path, seek to injure the sacrifice; the\nPrastotr follows along with the Saman, the slayer of Raksases, is the Saman;\n(verily it serves) for the smiting away of the Raksases. Thrice he performs\nthe finale; these worlds are three; verily from these worlds [1] he smites\naway the Raksases. Each one performs the finale; for each one is infested by\nthe Raksases, for the smiting away of the Raksases. \'King Varuna hath made a\nbroad (path)\', he says, for support. \'A hundred remedies are thine, O king, a\nthousand\', he says; verily he makes medicine for him. \'The noose of Varuna is\novercome\', he says verily he overcomes the noose of Varuna. He makes offering\nover the strew, for the support of the oblations; verily also he offers in\nwhat has fire. He offers the fore-offerings omitting that to the strew [2];\nthe strew is offspring; verily he frees offspring from Varuna\'s noose. He\noffers the two portions of butter; verily he does not obstruct the two eyes of\nthe sacrifice. He sacrifices to Varuna; verily he frees him from Varuna\'s\nnoose. He sacrifices to Agni and Varuna; verily straightway he frees him from\nVaruna\'s noose. He offers two after-offerings, omitting that to the strew; the\nstrew is offspring; verily he frees offspring from Varuna\'s noose. He offers\nfour fore-offerings and two after-offerings; they make up six, the seasons are\nsix [3]; verily he finds support in the seasons. \'O bath, O flood\', he says;\nverily he propitiates by this utterance Varuna. In the sea is thy heart,\nwithin the waters\', he says, for Varuna is in the sea. \'Let the plants and the\nwaters enter thee" he says; verily he unites him with the waters and the\nplants. \'Ye divine waters, this is thy foetus\', he says; that is according to\nthe text. The Soma is cattle [4]; if he were to partake of the drops, he would\nbe possessed of cattle, but Varuna would seize him; if he were not to partake,\nhe would have no cattle, but Varuna would not seize him; he should touch them\nonly, he becomes possessed of cattle, Varuna seizes him not. \'The noose of\nVaruna is loosed\', he says; verily is he freed from Varuna\'s noose. They\nadvance without looking round, for concealment from Varuna. \'Thou art fuel may\nwe prosper\', he says; verily with the kindling-stick they approach the fire in\nreverence. \'Thou art brilliance; grant me brilliance\', he says; verily he\nbestows brilliance upon himself.\n\n### vi. 6. 4.\n\nWith the wooden sword he digs up the altar, with the axle of a chariot he\nmeasures. He sets up the sacrificial post; verily gathering together a\nthreefold bolt he hurls it at his foe, to lay him low. If he were to set it up\nwithin the altar, he would win the world of the gods; if outside the altar,\nthe world of men; he sets it up in the place where the altar and the edge\n(outside) meet, for the winning of both worlds. He should set (the set) up\nwith the lower parts alike for one who desires the world of the Pitrs, with\nthe girdle part alike for one who desires the world of men, with the top\npieces alike for one who desires power, and all alike for one who desires\nsupport; the three in the middle alike for one who desires cattle; for through\nthem [1] cattle attend (on him); verily he becomes possessed of cattle. He\nshould interlock the others; verily he interlocks him with offspring and\ncattle. If he desire of a man, \'May he be liable to die\', he should set it up\nfor him in grave fashion, the northern half the higher, then (the southern)\nthe lower; this is the grave fashion; he for whom he sets it up thus swiftly\ndies. For him who desires the heaven he should set it up with the southern\nhalf the higher, then the (northern) half the lower; verily the sacrificer\nmakes it a ladder and a bridge to attain the world of heaven [2]. In that on\none post he twines round two girdles, therefore one man wins two wives; in\nthat he does not wind one girdle round two posts, therefore one wife does not\nfind two husbands. If he desire of a man, \'Be a girl born to him\', he should\nintertwine (the girdles) near the ends; verily a girl is born to him; if he\ndesire of a man, \'Be a son born to him\', he should cover it round right up to\nthe end; verily a son is born to him [3]. The Asuras drove the gods to the\nsouth, the gods repelled them by the Upa\xc3\xa7aya (post); that is why the Upa\xc3\xa7aya\nhas its name. In that the Upa\xc3\xa7aya lies near ( _upa \xc3\xa7aye_) on the south, (it\nserves) to drive away the foe. All the other posts have victims (attached),\nthe Upa\xc3\xa7aya has none, its victim is the sacrificer; if he were not to indicate\n(a victim), the sacrificer would be ruined. \'N.N. is thy victim\', (with these\nwords) he should indicate whomsoever he hates; whom he hates [4], him he\nindicates as a victim to it. If he hates not, \'The mole is thy victim\', he\nshould say; he harms not domestic nor wild animals. Prajapati created\noffspring; he was destitute of proper food, he saw this set of eleven, and\ntherewith he won proper food. In that there are ten posts, the Viraj has ten\nsyllables, and the Viraj is food, he wins proper food by the Viraj [5];\nthereby he milks the eleventh breast of her. In that the set of eleven (is set\nup), a thunderbolt is set up; it is liable to crush the sacrifice face to\nface; in that he sets up (the stake) (for Tvastr) with the wives, (it serves)\nto establish the sacrifice and to bind.\n\n### vi. 6. 5.\n\nPrajapati created offspring; he thought himself emptied, he saw this set of\neleven (victims), with it he bestowed life, power, and strength upon himself;\nhe who sacrifices creates as it were offspring; then he is as it were emptied;\nin that this set of eleven is (offered), with it the sacrificer bestows life,\npower, and strength upon himself. With (the victim) for Agni he scatters, with\nthat for Sarasvati he makes a pairing, with that for Soma he impregnates seed\n[1], with that for Pusan he propagates. There is one for Brhaspati; Brhaspati\nis the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily with the holy power (Brahman)\nhe produces offspring for him. There is one for the All-gods; offspring are\nconnected with the All-gods; verily he produces offspring, for him. By that\nfor Indra he wins power, by that for the Maruts the people, by that for Indra\nand Agni force and might. That for Savitr is for instigation, that for Varuna\nto free oneself from Varuna\'s (noose). In the middle he offers that for Indra;\nverily in the middle he bestows power on the sacrificer [2]. In front of that\nfor Indra he offers that for the All-gods; food is connected with the All-\ngods; verily he puts food in front; therefore food is eaten in front. Having\noffered that for Indra he offers that for the Maruts; the Maruts are the\npeople; verily he fastens the people to him. If he desire, \'May he who has\nattained (power) be banished; may he who is banished return (to power)\', in\nthe place of that for Indra he should offer that for Varuna, in the place of\nthat for Varuna that for Indra [3]. He who has attained (power) is banished,\nhe who is banished returns (to power). If he desire, \'May the people fall into\nconfusion\', he should interchange the animals; verily he causes the people to\nfall into confusion. If he should offer that to Varuna along the stream of the\nwaters, Varuna would seize his offspring; he offers (the victim) facing north\non the south side against the stream of the waters, to prevent Varuna seizing\nhis offspring.\n\n### vi. 6. 6.\n\nIndra caused Manu to sacrifice with his wife; after she had been encircled\nwith fire he let her go; therewith Manu prospered; in that he lets go (the\nvictim), (for Tvastr with the wives, the sacrificer prospers with the\nprosperity with which Manu prospered. From what is unsupported in the\nsacrifice the sacrifice comes to ruin; as the sacrifice comes to ruin the\nsacrificer comes to ruin along with it; in that he completes (the offering)\n(for Tvastr) with the wives with butter, (it serves) to support the sacrifice,\nand as the sacrifice finds support, the sacrificer finds support along with\nit. The offering of the caul [1] has been performed, the offering of the cow\nis not yet over, then he performs (the offering) (for Tvastr) with the wives;\nverily he performs it at the right moment; then indeed comes the conclusion.\nIt is for Tvastr; Tvastr of the seed that is spilt moulds forms, him he sets\nloose as a male among wives; he for him moulds forms.\n\n### vi. 6. 7.\n\nThey kill the Soma in that they press it; in that there is (an oblation) of\nSoma, that is as when they slay for the dead a barren cow. If he were to offer\nin the northern half or the middle, he would cause conflict with the gods; he\noffers on the southern half; this is the quarter of the Pitrs; verily in their\nown quarter he propitiates the Pitrs. They give to the Udgatrs, (the oblation)\nof Soma has the Saman for its deity; whatever of the Saman they do amiss, that\nis the atonement for it. They look at [1] (the victim) for Soma is a purifier;\nverily they purify themselves. He who cannot see himself would be dead. Having\nmade it full all round, he should look at (it), for in it he sees himself;\nverily also he purifies himself. He whose mind is gone should look at (it),\n(saying), \'That mind of mine which hath gone away, or which hath gone\nelsewhere, by means of King Soma, we keep within us\'; verily he keeps his mind\nin himself [2], his mind is not gone. At the third pressing the sacrifice\ndeparts from him who has sacrificed to him who has not sacrificed; he offers\nghee with a verse to Agni and Visnu; all the deities are Agni, the sacrifice\nis Visnu; verily he supports the deities and the sacrifice. He sacrifices\nmuttering, for pairing. The theologians say, \'Mitra appropriates the well-\nperformed part of the sacrifice, Varuna the ill-performed; where then is the\nsacrifice, and where the sacrificer?; In that he offers a cow to Mitra and\nVaruna, by Mitra [3] he propitiates the well-performed part of the sacrifice,\nby Varuna the ill-performed; the sacrificer is not ruined. Even as men plough\nthe field with the plough, so do the Rc and the Saman plough the sacrifice; in\nthat he offers a cow to Mitra and Varuna, verily he rolls a roller over the\nploughed-up sacrifice, for atonement. The metres of him who has sacrificed are\nworn out, the cow is the sap of the metres; in that he offers the cow to Mitra\nand Varuna, he again delights the metres, to drive away weariness; verily also\nhe bestows sap upon the metres.\n\n### vi. 6. 8.\n\nThe gods divided up power and strength; what there was left over became the\nAtigrahya cups, and that is why the Atigrahyas have their name. In that the\nAtigrahyas are drawn, verily thus the sacrificer bestows. upon himself power\nand strength, brilliance by that for Agni, power by that for Indra, splendour\nby that for Surya. The Atigrahyas are the support of the sacrifice, the\nPrsthas are the two wheels, if he were not to. draw them in the Prsthya\n(rite), the Prsthas would destroy the sacrifice in front; if he were to draw\nthem in the Ukthya [1], the Atigrahyas would destroy the sacrifice behind; but\nthey should be drawn in the Vi\xc3\xa7vajit with all the Prsthas, so that the\nsacrifice may have all its strength. Prajapati indicated the sacrifices to the\ngods, he put away their dear forms, they became the Atigrahya; \'Bodiless is\nhis sacrifice\', they say, \'for whom the Atigrahyas are not drawn.\' They should\nbe drawn also in the Agnistoma, so that the sacrifice may have its body. All\nthe deities were alike, and were not discriminated; these gods [2] saw these\ncups and drew them, Agni that for Agni, Indra that for Indra, Surya that for\nSurya; then indeed were they discriminated from the other gods; he, for whom\nknowing thus these cups are drawn, is discriminated from his evil foe. \'These\nworlds must be made full of light, with like strength\', they say; verily with\nthat for Agni he bestows light on this world, with that for Indra on the\natmosphere, for Indra and Vayu are yoke-fellows; with that for Surya on yonder\nworld [3] he bestows light; full of light these worlds become for him; he\nmakes them of like strength. Bamba and Vi\xc3\xa7vavayasa found these cups, and to\nthem these worlds, the distant and the near, became revealed; to him, for whom\nknowing thus these cups are drawn, these worlds, the distant and the near,\nbecome revealed.\n\n### vi. 6. 9.\n\nWhatever the gods did at the sacrifice the Asuras did. The gods caused the\nmetres and the pressings to find support in the Adabhya; then the gods\nprospered, the Asuras were defeated; he, for whom knowing thus the Adabhya is\ndrawn, prospers himself, his foe is defeated. Because the gods deceived the\nAsuras with the Adabhya (undeceivable), that is why the Adabhya has its name.\nHe who knows thus deceives his foe; his foe deceives him not [1]. The Adabhya\nis the form of Prajapati, called the freer; he draws from (the Soma) which is\ntied up, for freedom; he who knows thus is set free from his evil foe. They\nkill the Soma in that they press it; in the slaying of the Soma the sacrifice\nis slain, with the sacrifice the sacrificer. The theologians say, \'What is it\nthat the sacrificer does in the sacrifice whereby he goes alive to the world\nof heaven?\' The Adabhya is the taking alive; he draws from (the Soma) before\npressing; verily he makes him go alive to the world of heaven. Now they break\nthe sacrifice asunder when they make it find support in the Adabhya; he lets\ngo the shoots, for the continuance of the sacrifice.\n\n### vi. 6. 10.\n\nThe gods drew the cups in a line; Prajapati saw this An\xc3\xa7u, drew it, and\ntherewith prospered. Verily he, for whom knowing thus the An\xc3\xa7u is drawn,\nprospers. He draws from (the Soma) when it has been once pressed, for once he\nprospered thereby. He draws with the mind, for Prajapati is mind as it were;\n(verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati. He draws with (a vessel) of Udumbara;\nthe Udumbara is strength; verily he wins strength; it has four corners; verily\nhe finds support in the quarters [1]. He who knows the foundation of the An\xc3\xa7u\nbecomes possessed of a foundation. The Saman is that called the Vamadevya;\nsinging in his mind that foundation he draws; verily he becomes possessed of a\nfoundation. If the Adhvaryu were not to make a success of drawing the An\xc3\xa7u,\nfor both the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer would it go ill; if he were to make a\nsuccess, for both would it go well; he draws without breathing; this is its\nsuccess. He breathes over gold; gold is immortality, breath is life; verily\nwith life he quickens immortality; it is of a hundred (Krsnalas) in weight,\nman has a hundred (years of) life, a hundred powers; verily in life, in power\nhe finds support.\n\n### vi. 6. 11.\n\nPrajapati assigned the sacrifices to the gods; he thought himself emptied; he\npressed over himself the power and strength of the sacrifice in sixteen ways;\nthat became the Soda\xc3\xa7in; there is no sacrifice called Soda\xc3\xa7in; in that there\nis a sixteenth Stotra and a sixteenth \xc3\x87astra, therefore is it the Soda\xc3\xa7in, and\nthat is why the Soda\xc3\xa7in has its name. In that the Soda\xc3\xa7in is drawn, so the\nsacrificer bestows power and strength upon himself. To the gods the world of\nheaven [1] did not become manifest; they saw this Soda\xc3\xa7in, and drew it; then\ndid the world of heaven become manifest to them; in that the Soda\xc3\xa7in is drawn,\n(it serves) for the conquest of the world of heaven. Indra was the youngest of\nthe gods, he had recourse to Prajapati, he bestowed on him the Soda\xc3\xa7in, he\ndrew it; then indeed did he attain the summit of the gods; he for whom knowing\nthus the Soda\xc3\xa7in [2] is drawn attains the summit of his equals. He draws at\nthe morning pressing; the Soda\xc3\xa7in is the thunderbolt, the morning pressing is\nthe thunderbolt; verily he draws it from its own birthplace. At each pressing\nhe draws; verily from each pressing he produces it. At the third pressing he\nshould draw (it) for one who desires cattle; the Soda\xc3\xa7in is the thunderbolt,\nthe third pressing is cattle; verily by means of the thunderbolt he wins for\nhim cattle from the third pressing. He should not draw (it) in the Ukthya; the\nUkthas are offspring and cattle; if he were to draw (it) in the Ukthya [3], he\nwould consume his offspring and cattle. He should draw (it) for one who\ndesires cattle in the Atiratra; the Soda\xc3\xa7in is the thunderbolt; verily having\nwon cattle for him by the thunderbolt, he calms them later with (the \xc3\x87astras\nof) the night. He should also draw (it) in the Agnistoma for a Rajanya, for a\nRajanya sacrifices desiring distinction; verily in the day rite he grasps a\nbolt for him, and the bolt kindles him to prosperity, or it burns him; the\ntwenty-onefold is the Stotra used, for support; what is recited has the word\n\'bay\' in it; he obtains the dear abode of Indra [4]. The smaller metres were\namong the gods, the larger among the Asuras; the gods recited the larger metre\nwith the smaller on either side; then indeed did they appropriate the world of\nthe Asuras. In that he recites the larger metre with a smaller metre on either\nside, verily thus he appropriates the world of his foe. They make six\nsyllables redundant; the seasons are six; verily he delights the seasons. They\nplace four in front [5]; verily he wins four-footed cattle; two last; verily\nhe wins two-footed (cattle); they make up an Anustubh; the Anustubh is speech,\ntherefore speech is the highest of the breaths. When the sun is half-set, he\nsets about the Stotra of the Soda\xc3\xa7in; in this world Indra slew Vrtra; verily\nstraightway be hurls the bolt against his foe. The sacrificial fee is a\nreddish-brown horse; that is the form of the bolt; (verily it serves) for\nsuccess.\n\n'
