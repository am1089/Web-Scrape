Some say: 'Let him take a Gayatri hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, Gayatri is\nbrightness and glory of countenance, and thus the sacrificer becomes bright\nand glorious.'\n\n2\\. Others say: 'Let him take a Ush _n_ ih hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, Ush\n_n_ ih is life, and thus the sacrificer has a long life.'\n\nOthers say: 'Let him take an Anush _t_ ubh hymn\n\np. 162\n\nfor the Pra-uga. Verily, Anush _t_ ubh is valour, and it serves for obtaining\nvalour.'\n\nOthers say: 'Let him take a B _ri_ hati hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, B _ri_\nhati is fortune, and thus the sacrificer becomes fortunate.'\n\nOthers say: 'Let him take a Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti is\nfood, and thus the sacrificer becomes rich in food.'\n\nOthers say: 'Let him take a Trish _t_ ubh hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, Trish\n_t_ ubh is strength, and thus the sacrificer becomes strong.'\n\nOthers say: 'Let him take a _G_ agati hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, cattle is\n_G_ agati-like, and thus the sacrificer becomes rich in cattle.'\n\nBut we say: 'Let him take a Gayatri hymn only. Verily, Gayatri is Brahman, and\nthat day (the mahavrata) is (for the attainment of) Brahman. Thus he obtains\nBrahman by means of Brahman.\n\n4\\. 'And it must be a Gayatri hymn by Madhu _k_ _kh_ andas,\n\n5\\. 'For Madhu _k_ _kh_ andas is called Madhu _k_ _kh_ andas, because he\nwishes ( _kh_ andati) for honey (madhu) for the _Ri_ shis.\n\n6\\. 'Now food verily is honey, all is honey, all desires are honey, and thus\nif he recites the hymn of Madhu _k_ _kh_ andas, it serves for the attainment\nof all desires.\n\n7\\. 'He who knows this, obtains all desires.'\n\nThis (Gayatri pra-uga), according to the one-day (ekaha) ceremonial 1, is\nperfect in form 2. On that day (the mahavrata) much is done now and then which\n\np. 163\n\nhas to be hidden 1, and has to be atoned for y recitation of hymns). Atonement\n( _s_ anti) is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the year\n(on the last day but one of the sacrifice that lasts a whole year) the\nsacrificers rest on this atonement as their rest.\n\n8\\. He who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hot _ri_ priest who\nknows this, recites this hymn.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[161:3](sbe01182.htm#fr_392) Thus far the hymn which has to be recited by the\nHot _ri_ priest, after the eating of the _ri_ tugrabas, has been considered.\nWhat follows next is the so-called Pra-uga hymn, consisting of seven t _ri_\n_k_ as, which the Hot _ri_ has to recite after the Vi _s_ vedevagraha.\nDifferent _S_ akhas recommend hymns of different metres, our _S_ akha fixes on\nthe Gayatri.\n\n[162:1](sbe01182.htm#fr_393) It is copied from the Vi _s_ va _g_ it, and that\nfrom the Agnish _t_ oma.\n\n[162:2](sbe01182.htm#fr_394) Nothing is wanting for its performance, if one\nonly follows the rules given in the Agnish _t_ oma.\n\n[163:1](sbe01182.htm#fr_395) Dasin _ri_ tya-bahubhutamaithuna-brahma _k_ aripu\n_m_ _s_ _k_ alisamprava-dadikam. See Rajendralal Mitra, Introduction to his\nedition of the Aitareya-ara _n_ yaka, p. 25. It might be better to join ekaha\n_h_ with _s_ antyam, but even then the argumentation is not quite clear.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 4](sbe01183.htm)\n\n"
