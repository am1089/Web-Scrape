Grief of him (i.e. of _G_ ana _s_ ruti) (arose) on account of his hearing\na disrespectful speech about himself; on account of the rushing on of that\n(grief) (Raikva called him _S_ udra); for it (the grief) is pointed at (by\nRaikva).\n\n(In the preceding adhikara _n_ a) the exclusiveness of the claim of men to\nknowledge has been refuted, and it has been declared that the gods, &c. also\npossess such a claim. The present adhikara _n_ a is entered on for the purpose\nof removing the doubt whether, as the exclusiveness of the\n\np. 224\n\nclaim of twice-born men is capable of refutation, the _S_ udras also possess\nsuch a claim.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the _S_ udras also have such a claim, because\nthey may be in the position of desiring that knowledge, and because they are\ncapable of it; and because there is no scriptural prohibition (excluding them\nfrom knowledge) analogous to the text, 'Therefore 1 the _S_ udra is unfit for\nsacrificing' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. VII, 1, 1, 6). The reason, moreover, which\ndisqualifies the _S_ udras for sacrificial works, viz. their being without the\nsacred fires, does not invalidate their qualification for knowledge, as\nknowledge can be apprehended by those also who are without the fires. There is\nbesides an inferential mark supporting the claim of the _S_ udras; for in the\nso-called sa _m_ varga-knowledge he (Raikva) refers to _G_ ana _s_ ruti\nPautraya _n_ a, who wishes to learn from him, by the name of _S_ udra 'Fie,\nnecklace and carnage be thine, O _S_ udra, together with the cows' ( _Kh_. Up.\nIV, 2, 3). Sm _ri_ ti moreover speaks of Vidura and others who were born from\n_S_ udra mothers as possessing eminent knowledge.--Hence the _S_ udra has a\nclaim to the knowledge of Brahman.\n\nTo this we reply that the _S_ udras have no such claim, on account of their\nnot studying the Veda. A person who has studied the Veda and understood its\nsense is indeed qualified for Vedic matters; but a _S_ udra does not study the\nVeda, for such study demands as its antecedent the upanayana-ceremony, and\nthat ceremony belongs to the three (higher) castes only. The mere circumstance\nof being in a condition of desire does not furnish a reason for qualification,\nif capability is absent. Mere temporal capability again does not constitute a\nreason for qualification, spiritual capability being required in spiritual\nmatters. And spiritual capability is (in the case of the _S_ udras) excluded\nby their being excluded from the study of the Veda.--The Vedic statement,\nmoreover, that the _S_ udra is unfit for sacrifices intimates, because\n\np. 225\n\nfounded on reasoning, that he is unfit for knowledge also; for the\nargumentation is the same in both cases  1\\--With reference to the\npurvapakshin's opinion that the fact of the word ' _S_ udra' being enounced in\nthe sa _m_ varga-knowledge constitutes an inferential mark (of the _S_ udra's\nqualification for knowledge), we remark that that inferential mark has no\nforce, on account of the absence of arguments. For the statement of an\ninferential mark possesses the power of intimation only in consequence of\narguments being adduced; but no such arguments are brought forward in the\npassage quoted.  2 Besides, the word ' _S_ udra' which occurs in the sa _m_\nvarga-vidya would establish a claim on the part of the _S_ udras to that one\nvidya only, not to all vidyas. In reality, however, it is powerless, because\noccurring in an arthavada, to establish the _S_ udras' claim to anything.--The\nword ' _S_ udra' can moreover be made to agree with the context in which it\noccurs in the following manner. When _G_ ana _s_ ruti Pautraya _n_ a heard\nhimself spoken of with disrespect by the flamingo ('How can you speak of him,\nbeing what he is, as if he were like Raikva with the car?' IV, i, 3), grief\n(su _k_ ) arose in his mind, and to that grief the _ri_ shi Raikva alludes\nwith the word _S_ udra, in order to show thereby his knowledge of what is\nremote. This explanation must be accepted because a (real) born _S_ udra is\nnot qualified (for the sa _m_ varga-vidya. If it be asked how the grief (su\n_k_ ) which had arisen in _G_ anasruti's mind can be referred to by means of\nthe word _S_ udra, we reply: On account of the rushing on (adrava _n_ a) of\nthe grief. For we may etymologise the word _S_ udra by dividing it into its\nparts, either as 'he rushed into grief ( _S_ u _k_ am abhidudrava) or as\n'grief rushed on\n\np. 226\n\nhim,' or as 'he in his grief rushed to Raikva;' while on the other hand it is\nimpossible to accept the word in its ordinary conventional sense. The\ncircumstance (of the king actually being grieved) is moreover expressly\ntouched upon in the legend 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[224:1](sbe34103.htm#fr_224) The commentaries explain 'therefore' by 'on\naccount of his being devoid of the three sacred fires.' This explanation does\nnot, however, agree with the context of the Taitt. Sa _m_ h.\n\n[225:1](sbe34103.htm#fr_225) The _S_ udra not having acquired a knowledge of\nVedic matters in the legitimate way, i. e. through the study of the Veda under\nthe guidance of a guru, is unfit for sacrifices as well as for vidya.\n\n[225:2](sbe34103.htm#fr_226) The li _n_ ga contained in the word ' _S_ udra'\nhas no proving power as it occurs in an arthavada-passage which has no\nauthority if not connected with a corresponding injunctive passage. In our\ncase the li _n_ ga in the arthavada-passage is even directly contradicted by\nthose injunctions which militate against the _S_ udras' qualification for\nVedic matters.\n\n[226:1](sbe34103.htm#fr_227) Ha _m_ savakyad atmano#nadara _m_ _s_ rutva _g_\nana _s_ rute _h_ _s_ ug utpannety etad eva katha _m_ gamyate yenasau _s_ udra\n_s_ abdena su _k_ yate tatraha sp _ris_ yate _k_ eti. \xc3\x82nanda Giri.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 35](sbe34104.htm)\n\n"
