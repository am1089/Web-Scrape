Let me with my voice shower [1](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:1:1) wealth like\ncloud-showers [2](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:1:2), like sacrifices of a sage, rich\nin oblations. I have praised the goodly host of the Maruts\n[3](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:1:3), so that they may be worthy of a Brahman\n[4](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:1:4) so that they may be glorious.\n\n2\\. These boys have prepared their ornaments for beauty, the goodly host of\nthe Maruts, through many nights; the sons of Dyu struggled, like harts, they,\nthe \xc3\x82dityas, grew high, like banners [1](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:2:1).\n\n3\\. They who by their own might seem to have risen above heaven and earth,\nlike the sun above the cloud, they are glorious, like brilliant heroes, they\nshine forth like foe-destroying youths.\n\n4\\. When you move along on the bottom of the waters, the earth seems to break\nand to melt [1](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:4:1). This perfect sacrifice is meet for\nyou, come hither together, as if enjoying our offerings.\n\n5\\. You are as drivers [1](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:5:1) on the poles with their\nreins, and as brilliant with light at daybreak; like hawks, you are famous\ndestroyers of foes; like wells [2](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:5:2) springing forth,\nyou scatter moisture.\n\n6\\. When you, O Maruts, come from afar, knowing the great treasure of the\nhidden place, O Vasus, the treasure which has to be gained, then keep away\nalso from afar all who hate us.\n\n7\\. The man who, firm in his sacrifice, offers gifts to the Maruts to the end\nof the ceremony [1](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:7:1), he\n\np. 413\n\ngains health and wealth, blessed with offspring; he shall also be in the\nkeeping of the gods.\n\n8\\. They are indeed our guardians, to be worshipped at all sacrifices, most\nblissful by their name of \xc3\x82dityas; may they, swiftly driving on their\nchariots, protect our prayer, quick even on their march, delighting in our\nsacrifice.\n\np. 414\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Syumara _s_ mi Bhargava. On the metre, see Rig-veda, translation,\nIntrod. p. civ; Benfey, Quantitatsversch. IV, 2; 38-39; Oldenberg,\nProlegomena, 92. This hymn and the next belong closely together. They are both\nso artificial and obscure that a translation of them can only be tentative.\nNone of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., MS.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. I take prusha for prusha _n_ i.\n\nNote 2. I do not think that abhraprusha _h_ can be meant for the Maruts.\n\nNote 3. The na in many of the verses seems to be due to a mere trick, and\nuntranslatable.\n\nNote 4. Or, 'I have praised the priestly host, so that they may be worthy of\ngood Marut-hood.'\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Akra\xc2\xb4 _h_ , banners, Grassmann; columns, Ludwig. The meaning is\nutterly unknown.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. See Aurel Mayr, Beitrage aus dem Rig-Veda. p. 12. 'The earth melted,'\nsee Ps. xlvi. 6.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Prayu _g_ seems to mean here a driver; pra-yu _g_ is often used of the\nMaruts as harnessing or driving their horses; see I, 85, 5; V, 52, 8.\n\nNote 2. Prava has been derived from pru, to float. I should prefer to derive\nit from pra-van, from which we have pra-va _n_ a, precipice, possibly the\nLatin adjective pronus, and, very irregularly, Greek \xcf\x80\xcf\x81\xce\xb7\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb5\xcf\x82. Stems in radical\nn frequently enter the class of stems in a and a, and pravan would become\nprava _h_ or prava _h_ , as - _g_ an becomes - _g_ a _h_ and - _g_ a _h_ ; cf.\nLanman,\n\np. 415\n\np. 478. Others take vana for a mere suffix like vat. Prava, rushing forward,\nwould have been a good name for a spring. This, of course, is a mere\nconjecture. Others derive prava-s from va, to blow. As a substantive prava as\nwell as upava occurs AV. XII, 1, 51. va\xc2\xb4tasya prava\xc2\xb4m upava\xc2\xb4m anu vaty arki\n_h_. But these words mean the blowing before and the blowing after, and not\nblowers. There are the verbs prava and anuva in Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. I, 9, 7; TS.\nIII, 5, 2, 3; IV, 4, 1, 1. They are there referred to dawn and night. These\npassages, however, seem too technical to allow us to fix the original meaning\nof prava- _h_. Prava in RV. I, 34, 8, remains unexplained.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. On ud _ri_ _k_ i, see Ludwig's note.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 78. To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)](sbe3254.htm)\n\n"
