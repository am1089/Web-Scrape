But the subtle (body is meant by the term avyakta) on account of its\ncapability (of being so designated).\n\nIt has been asserted, under the preceding Sutra, that the term 'the\nUndeveloped' signifies, on account of the general\n\np. 242\n\nsubject-matter and because the body only remains, the body and not the\npradhana of the Sa _n_ khyas.--But here the following doubt arises: How can\nthe word 'undeveloped' appropriately denote the body which, as a gross and\nclearly appearing thing, should rather be called vyakta, i.e. that which is\ndeveloped or manifested?\n\nTo this doubt the Sutra replies that what the term avyakta denotes is the\nsubtle causal body. Anything subtle may be spoken of as Undeveloped. The gross\nbody indeed cannot directly be termed 'undeveloped,' but the subtle parts of\nthe elements from which the gross body originates may be called so, and that\nthe term denoting the causal substance is applied to the effect also is a\nmatter of common occurrence; compare, for instance, the phrase 'mix the Soma\nwith cows, i.e. milk' ( _Ri_ g-veda. S. IX, 46, 4). Another scriptural passage\nalso--'now all this was then undeveloped' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 7)--shows that\nthis, i.e. this developed world with its distinction of names and forms, is\ncapable of being termed undeveloped in so far as in a former condition it was\nin a merely seminal or potential state, devoid of the later evolved\ndistinctions of name and form.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 3](sbe34114.htm)\n\n"
