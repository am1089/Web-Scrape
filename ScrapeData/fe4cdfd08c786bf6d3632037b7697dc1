The hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara is hair, the prastava skin, the udgitha flesh, the pratihara\nbone, the nidhana marrow.

He who thus knows the Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1aya _g_ \xc3\xb1iya, as interwoven in the members\nof the body, becomes possessed of strong limbs, he is not crippled in any\nlimb, he reaches the full life, he lives long, becomes great with children and\ncattle, great by fame. His rule is, 'Do not eat marrow for a year,' or 'Do not\neat marrow at all.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 20](sbe01054.htm)\n\n"
