And on account of the endurance of the final (size), and the (resulting)\npermanency of both; there is no difference.\n\nThe final size of the soul, i.e. the size it has in the state of Release, is\nenduring since the soul does not subsequently pass into another body; and\nboth, i.e. the soul in the state of Release and the size of that soul, are\npermanent (nitya). From this it follows that that ultimate size is the true\nessential size of the soul and also belongs to it previously to Release.
