The sacrifice which is here spoken of and in\nwhich S'ankar or S'iva (called also here Rudra and Bhava) smote the Gods\nbecause he had not been invited to share the sacred oblations with them, seems\nto refer to the origin of the worship of S'iva, to its increase and to the\nstruggle it maintained with other older forms of worship.' GORRESIO.\n\n[78:2](ry066.htm#fr_246) Sita means a furrow.\n\n  \n         'Great Erectheus swayed,  \n   That owed his nurture to the blue-eyed maid,  \n   But from the teeming furrow took his birth,  \n   The mighty offspring of the foodful earth.'  \n                                          Iliad, Book II.\n\n[78:3](ry066.htm#fr_247) 'The whole story of Sita, as will be seen in the\ncourse of the poem has a great analogy with the ancient myth of Proserpine.'\nGORRESIO.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXVII.: The Breaking of The Bow.](ry067.htm)\n\n"
