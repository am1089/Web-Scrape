He should try to satiate him.\n\n3\\. They say indeed with regard to sacrifice: 'Through the Brahma _n_ a's\nbeing satiated (with sacrificial food) I become satiated myself.'\n\n4\\. Then (he should give to the Brahman) what other food has just become\nready.\n\n5\\. Then he should try to gain the favour of Brahma _n_ as by (gifts of) food.\n\n6. 6 A full vessel constitutes the fee for the sacrifice; that he should give to the Brahman.\n\n7\\. A brazen vessel or a wooden cup which has been filled with food, with\nprepared food or with raw food, or even only with fruits: this they call a\nfull vessel.\n\n8. 8 The Brahman is the only officiating priest at the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as.\n\n9\\. (The sacrificer) himself is Hot _ri_.\n\n10\\. A full vessel (see Sutra 7) is the lowest sacrificial fee at a Pakaya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a.\n\n11\\. The highest is unlimited.\n\n12. 12 Thus Sudas Pai _g_ avana, after having offered the sacrifice of a mess of cooked food to Indra and\n\np. 39\n\n[paragraph continues] Agni, gave one hundred thousand (cows as the sacrificial\nfee).\n\n13\\. Now if he should not be able to get for the morning or for the evening\noblation, or for the sacrifices of the full or of the new moon at his (sacred)\ndomestic fire, any substance fit for sacrifice or a person who could sacrifice\n(instead of himself, if he is prevented): what ought he to do?\n\n14. 14 Until the evening oblation the (time for the) morning oblation is not elapsed, nor the (time for the) evening oblation until the morning oblation. Until the new moon the (time for the) sacrifice of the full moon is not elapsed, nor the (time for the) sacrifice of the new moon until the full moon.\n\n15\\. During that interval he should try to obtain sacrificial food or to find\na sacrificer.\n\n16. 16 Or (if he does not succeed in this) he should cook fruits or leaves of trees or herbs which are sacrificially pure, and should sacrifice them.\n\n17\\. Or he should at least sacrifice water; thus has said Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a,\nthe son of I _d_ a. For (even if he offers only water) the sacrifice has been\nperformed.\n\n18. 18 And there is an expiation for one who has not sacrificed.\n\np. 40\n\n19\\. And, (says Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a,) a Brahma _n_ a should not omit to keep his\nvow.\n\n20\\. Here they say also:\n\n21\\. He should keep (his vow) during that time in which he does not sacrifice,\nby abstaining from food.\n\n22. 22 When he then has obtained (the necessary substances for sacrificing), he should make up for the (omitted) oblations.\n\n23\\. For thus also his vow has been duly kept.\n\n24. 24 These rules (which have been given with regard to the sacrifices of the full and new moon) are valid for the Havis oblations which will be stated hereafter.\n\n25. 25 After the end of the Mantra follows the word Svaha.\n\n26. 26 At \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations he should only prepare that \xc3\x82 _g_ ya (chap. 7, 28) and should sacrifice it, picking out portions of it. (He should) not (sacrifice) the two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions nor the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n27. 27 At \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations he should, if no special rule is given, sacrifice with the Mahavyah _ri_ tis before and after (the chief ceremonies).\n\np. 41\n\n28. 28 As at the wedding, thus at the tonsure (of the child's head), the initiation (of the Brahma _k_ arin), and at the cutting of the beard.\n\n29. 29 At the end of the ceremony the Vamadevya is sung for the sake of averting evil. The Vamadevya is sung for the sake of averting evil.\n\nEnd of the First Prapa _th_ aka.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[38:1](sbe30012.htm#fr_171) 9, 1.

In\nthis teacher Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, son of I _d_ a, whose opinion on the\nperformance of certain Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as is here stated, we have of course to\nsee a fictitious sage of the same kind with the well-known _Ri_ shi Pragatha,\nto whom the authorship of a number of Suktas in the Pragatha book ( _Ri_\ng-veda, Ma _n_ _d_ ala VIII) is ascribed.\n\n[39:18](sbe30012.htm#fr_177) 18, 19.

Gobhila has\nused p. 41 the word a _g_ yahutishu in the beginning of Sutra 26, and it would\nhave been superfluous if he had repeated it in connection with the words na\n_g_ yabhagau na svish _t_ ak _ri_ t. In the corresponding Sutras of the\nKhadira the case was different, and there the words na _g_ yabhagau na svish\n_t_ ak _ri_ t inevitably required the addition of a word like a _g_ yahutishu,\nby which to show which class of sacrifices it was which required no \xc3\x82 _g_\nyabhagas and no Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t. The following word in the Khadira text,\nhowever, anade _s_ e, should be referred, against tradition, to Sutra 13, as\nis shown by the comparison of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I, 12, 13.\n\n[41:28](sbe30012.htm#fr_183) At the wedding, oblations are made first with the\nthree single Mahavyah _ri_ tis, afterwards with the Mahavyah _ri_ tis\ntogether; see below, II, 1, 25. 26.
