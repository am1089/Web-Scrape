O Agni, on to the strong host (of the Maruts), bedecked with golden chains\nand ornaments [1](sbe3238.htm#an_5:56:1:1). Today I call the folk of the\nMaruts down from the light of heaven.\n\n2\\. As thou (Agni) thinkest in thine heart, to the same object my wishes have\ngone. Strengthen thou these Maruts, terrible to behold, who have come nearest\nto thy invocations.\n\n3\\. Like a bountiful lady [1](sbe3238.htm#an_5:56:3:1), the earth comes\ntowards us, staggering, yet rejoicing; for your onslaught, O Maruts, is\nvigorous, like a bear, and fearful, like a wild bull.\n\n4\\. They who by their strength disperse wildly [1](sbe3238.htm#an_5:56:4:1)\nlike bulls, impatient of the yoke, they by their marches make the heavenly\nstone, the rocky mountain (cloud) [2](sbe3238.htm#an_5:56:4:2) to shake.\n\n5\\. Arise, for now I call with my hymns [1](sbe3238.htm#an_5:56:5:1) the troop\nof these Maruts, grown strong together, the manifold, the incomparable, as if\ncalling a drove of bulls.\n\n6\\. Harness the red mares to the chariot, harness the ruddy horses to the\nchariots, harness the two bays, ready to drive in the yoke, most vehement to\ndrive in the yoke.\n\n7\\. And this red stallion too, loudly neighing, has been placed here,\nbeautiful to behold; may it not cause you delay on your marches, O Maruts;\nspur him forth on your chariots.\n\np. 338\n\n8\\. We call towards us the glorious chariot of the Maruts, whereon there\nstands also Rodasi [1](sbe3238.htm#an_5:56:8:1), carrying delightful gifts,\namong the Maruts.\n\n9\\. I call hither this your host, brilliant on chariots, terrible and\nglorious, among which she, the wellborn and fortunate, the bounteous lady, is\nalso magnified among the Maruts.\n\np. 339\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same poet and deity, though Agni is invoked in the first, possibly in the\nsecond verse also. Metre, 1, 2, 4-6, 8, 9 B _ri_ hati; 3, 7 Satob _ri_ hati.\nNone of the verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., MS.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Here again some interpreters of the Veda take a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ i in the sense\nof paint, war-paint. It may be so, but the more general meaning of colours or\nornament seems, as yet, safer.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The earth is frequently represented as trembling under the fury of the\nMaruts. Here she is first called mi _lh_ ushmati, a curious compound which, in\nour verse, may possibly have a more special meaning. As the earth is not only\nstruck down by the storm, but at the same time covered with water and\nfertilised, she is represented as struck down and staggering, but likewise as\nrejoicing, possibly, as drunk.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. V _r i_tha means pell-mell, confusedly, wildly; see also Geldner, Ved.\nStud. p. 115.\n\nNote 2. \xc3\x81 _s_ ma svarya\xcc\x83 _h_ seems to mean the thunderbolt like va _g_ ra _h_\nsvarya\xcc\x83 _h_ in I, 32, 2; 67, 6. See also V, 30, 8. In that case we should have\nto translate, 'they let the heavenly bolt fall down on the rocky mountain.'\nBut _k_ yavayati is never used for the hurling of the thunderbolt, nor is it\nconstrued with two accusatives. It always means to shake what is firm, and we\nhave therefore to translate, they shake the heavenly stone (the sky), the\nrocky mountain (the cloud).' Parvata and giri often occur together, as in I,\n37, 7; VIII, 64, 5.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Stomai _h_ may possibly refer to samukshitanam.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. On Rodasi\xc2\xb4, see before, I, 167, 3.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 57. To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)](sbe3239.htm)\n\n"
