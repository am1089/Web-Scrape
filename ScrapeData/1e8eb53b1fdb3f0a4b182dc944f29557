Pra _n_ a (breath) 1 is Brahman, thus says Kaushitaki. Of this pra _n_ a,\nwhich is Brahman, the mind (manas) is the messenger, speech the housekeeper,\nthe eye the guard, the ear the informant. He who knows mind as the messenger\nof pra _n_ a, which is Brahman, becomes possessed of the messenger. He who\nknows speech as the housekeeper, becomes possessed of the housekeeper. He who\nknows the eye as the guard, becomes possessed of the guard. He who knows the\near as the informant, becomes possessed of the informant.\n\nNow to that pra _n_ a, which is Brahman, all these deities (mind, speech, eye,\near) bring an offering, though he asks not for it, and thus to him who knows\nthis all creatures bring an offering, though he asks not for it. For him who\nknows this, there is this Upanishad (secret vow), 'Beg not!' As a man who has\nbegged through a village and got nothing sits down and says, 'I shall never\neat anything given by those people,' and as then those who formerly refused\nhim press him (to accept their alms), thus is the rule for him who begs not,\nbut the charitable will press him and say, 'Let us give to thee.'\n\n2\\. Pra _n_ a (breath) is Brahman, thus says Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gya. And in that pra _n_ a,\nwhich is Brahman, the eye\n\np. 281\n\nstands firm behind speech, the ear stands firm behind the eye, the mind stands\nfirm behind the car, and the spirit stands firm behind the mind 1. To that pra\n_n_ a, which is Brahman, all these deities bring an offering, though he asks\nnot for it, and thus to him who knows this, all creatures bring an offering,\nthough he asks not for it. For him who knows this, there is this Upanishad\n(secret vow), 'Beg not!' As a man who has begged through a village and got\nnothing sits down and says, 'I shall never eat anything given by those\npeople,' and as then those who formerly refused him press him (to accept their\nalms), thus is the rule for him who begs not, but the charitable will press\nhim and say, 'Let us give to thee.'\n\n3\\. Now follows the attainment of the highest treasure (scil. pra _n_ a,\nspirit 2). If a man meditates on that highest treasure, let him on a full moon\nor a new moon, or in the bright fortnight, under an auspicious Nakshatra, at\none of these proper times, bending his right knee, offer oblations of ghee\nwith a ladle (sruva), after having placed the fire, swept the ground 3, strewn\nthe sacred grass, and sprinkled water. Let him say: 'The deity called Speech\nis\n\np. 282\n\nthe attainer, may it attain this for me from him (who possesses and can bestow\nwhat I wish for). Svaha to it!'\n\n'The deity called pra _n_ a (breath) is the attainer, may it attain this for\nme from him. Svaha to it!'\n\n'The deity called the eye is the attainer, may it attain this for me from him.\nSvaha to it!'\n\n'The deity called the car is the attainer, may it attain this for me from him.\nSvaha to it!'\n\n'The deity called mind (manas) is the attainer of it, may it attain this for\nme from him. Svaha to it.'\n\n'The deity called pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a (knowledge) is the attainer of it, may it attain\nthis for me from him. Svaha to it!'\n\nThen having inhaled the smell of the smoke, and having rubbed his limbs with\nthe ointment of ghee, walking on in silence, let him declare his wish, or let\nhim send a messenger. He will surely obtain his wish.\n\n4\\. Now follows the Daiva Smara, the desire to be accomplished by the gods. If\na man desires to become dear 1 to any man or woman, or to any men or women,\nthen at one of the (fore-mentioned) proper times he offers, in exactly the\nsame manner (as before), oblations of ghee, saying: 'I offer thy speech in\nmyself, I (this one here 2), Svaha.' 'I offer thy ear in myself, I (this one\nhere), Svaha.' 'I offer thy\n\np. 283\n\nmind in myself, I (this one here), Svaha.' 'I offer thy pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a (knowledge)\nin myself, I (this one here), Svaha.' Then having inhaled the smell of the\nsmoke, and having rubbed his limbs with the ointment of. ghee, walking on in\nsilence, let him try to come in contact or let him stand speaking in the wind,\n(so that the wind may carry his words to the person by whom he desires to be\nloved). Surely he becomes dear, and they think of him.\n\n5\\. Now follows the restraint (sa _m_ yamana) instituted by Pratardana (the\nson of Divodasa): they call it the inner Agni-hotra. So long as a man speaks,\nhe cannot breathe, he offers all the while his pra _n_ a (breath) in his\nspeech. And so long as a man breathes, he cannot speak, he offers all the\nwhile his speech in his breath. These two endless and immortal oblations he\noffers always, whether waking or sleeping. Whatever other oblations there are\n(those, e. g. of the ordinary Agnihotra, consisting of milk and other things),\nthey have an end, for they consist of works (which, like all works, have an\nend). The ancients, knowing this (the best Agnihotra), did not offer the\n(ordinary) Agnihotra.\n\n6\\. Uktha 1 is Brahman, thus said _S_ ushkabh _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85gara. Let him meditate on\nit (the uktha) as the same with the _Ri_ _k_ , and all beings will praise him\nas the best. Let him meditate on it as the same with the Ya _g_ us, and all\nbeings will join before him\n\np. 284\n\nas the best. Let him meditate on it as the same with the Saman, and all beings\nwill bow before him as the best 1. Let him meditate on it as the same with\nmight, let him meditate on it as the same with glory, let him meditate on it\nas the same with splendour. For as the bow is among weapons the mightiest, the\nmost glorious, the most splendid, thus is he who knows this among all beings\nthe mightiest, the most glorious, the most splendid. The Adhvaryu conceives\nthe fire of the altar, which is used for the sacrifice, to be himself. In it\nhe (the Adhvaryu) weaves the Ya _g_ us portion of the sacrifice. And in the Ya\n_g_ us portion the Hot _ri_ weaves the _Ri_ _k_ portion of the sacrifice. And\nin the _Ri_ _k_ portion the Udgat _ri_ weaves the Saman portion of the\nsacrifice. He (the Adhvaryu or pra _n_ a) is the self of the threefold\nknowledge; he indeed is the self of it (of pra _n_ a). He who knows this is\nthe self of it (becomes pra _n_ a 2).\n\np. 285\n\n7\\. Next follow the three kinds of meditation of the all-conquering (sarva _g_\nit) Kaushitaki. The all-conquering Kaushitaki adores the sun when rising,\nhaving put on the sacrificial cord 1, having brought water, and having thrice\nsprinkled the water-cup, saying: 'Thou art the deliverer, deliver me from\nsin.' In the same manner he adores the sun when in the zenith, saying: 'Thou\nart the highest deliverer, deliver me highly from sin.' In the same manner he\nadores the sun when setting, saying: 'Thou art the full deliverer, deliver me\nfully from sin.' Thus he fully removes whatever sin he committed by day and by\nnight. And in the same manner he who knows this, likewise adores the sun, and\nfully removes whatever sin he committed by day and by night.\n\n8\\. Then (secondly) let him worship every month (in the year) at the time of\nthe new moon, the moon as it is seen in the west in the same manner (as before\ndescribed with regard to the sun), or let him send forth his speech toward the\nmoon with two green blades of grass, saying: 'O thou who art mistress of\nimmortal joy, through that gentle heart of mine which abides in the moon, may\nI never weep for misfortune concerning my children.'\n\nThe children of him (who thus adores the moon) do not indeed die before him.\nThus it is with a man to whom a son is already born.\n\nNow for one to whom no son is born as yet. He mutters the three _Ri_ _k_\nverses. 'Increase, O Soma! may vigour come to thee' (Rv. I, 91, 16; IX, 31,\n4).\n\np. 286\n\n'May milk, may food go to thee' (Rv. I, 91, 18); 'That ray which the \xc3\x82dityas\ngladden.'\n\nHaving muttered these three _Ri_ _k_ verses, he says: 'Do not increase by our\nbreath (pra _n_ a), by our offspring, by our cattle; he who hates us and whom\nwe hate, increase by his breath, by his offspring, by his cattle. Thus I turn\nthe turn of the god, I return the turn of \xc3\x82ditya 1.' After these words, having\nraised the right arm (toward Soma), he lets it go again 2.\n\np. 287\n\n9\\. Then (thirdly) let him worship on the day of the full moon the moon as it\nis seen in the east in the same manner, saying: 'Thou art Soma, the king, the\nwise, the five-mouthed, the lord of creatures. The Brahma _n_ a is one of thy\nmouths; with that mouth thou eatest the kings (Kshatriyas); make me an eater\nof food by that mouth! The king is one of thy mouths; with that mouth thou\neatest the people (Vai _s_ yas); make me an eater of food by that mouth! The\nhawk is one of thy mouths; with that mouth thou eatest the birds; make me an\neater of food by that mouth! Fire is one of thy mouths; with that mouth thou\neatest this world; make me an eater of food by that mouth! In thee there is\nthe fifth mouth; with that mouth thou eatest all beings; make me an eater of\nfood by that mouth! Do not decrease by our life, by our offspring, by our\ncattle; he who hates us and whom we hate, decrease by his life, by his\noffspring, by his cattle. Thus I turn the turn of the god, I return the turn\nof \xc3\x82ditya.' After these words, having raised the right arm, he lets it go\nagain.\n\n10\\. Next (having addressed these prayers to Soma) when being with his wife,\nlet him stroke her\n\np. 288\n\nheart, saying: 'O fair one, who hast obtained immortal joy by that which has\nentered thy heart through Pra _g_ apati, mayest thou never fall into sorrow\nabout thy children 1.' Her children then do not die before her.\n\n11\\. Next, if a man has been absent and returns home, let him smell (kiss) his\nson's head, saying: 'Thou springest from every limb, thou art born from the\nheart, thou, my son, art my self indeed, live thou a hundred harvests.' He\ngives him his name, saying: 'Be thou a stone, be thou an axe, be thou solid 2\ngold; thou, my son, art light indeed, live thou a hundred harvests.' He\npronounces his name. Then he embraces him, saying: 'As Pra _g_ apati (the lord\nof creatures) embraced his creatures for their welfare, thus I embrace thee,'\n(pronouncing his name.) Then he mutters into his right ear, saying: 'O thou,\nquick Maghavan, give to him' (Rv. III, 36, 10 3). 'O Indra, bestow the best\nwishes' (Rv. II, 21, 6), thus he whispers into his left ear. Let him then\nthrice smell (kiss) his head, saying: 'Do not cut off (the line of our race),\ndo not suffer. Live a hundred harvests of life; I kiss thy head, O son, with\nthy name.' He then thrice makes a lowing sound over his head, saying: 'I low\nover thee with the lowing sound of cows.'\n\n12\\. Next follows the Daiva Parimara 4, the dying around of the gods (the\nabsorption of the two\n\np. 289\n\nclasses of gods, mentioned before, into pra _n_ a or Brahman). This Brahman\nshines forth indeed when the fire burns, and it dies when it burns not. Its\nsplendour goes to the sun alone, the life (pra _n_ a, the moving principle) to\nthe air.\n\nThis Brahman shines forth indeed when the sun is seen, and it dies when it is\nnot seen. Its splendour goes to the moon alone, the life (pra _n_ a) to the\nair.\n\nThis Brahman shines forth indeed when the moon is seen, and it dies when it is\nnot seen. Its splendour goes to the lightning alone, its life (pra _n_ a) to\nthe air.\n\nThis Brahman shines forth indeed when the lightning flashes, and it dies when\nit flashes not. Its splendour goes to the air, and the life (pra _n_ a) to the\nair.\n\nThus all these deities (i. e. fire, sun, moon, lightning), having entered the\nair, though dead, do not vanish; and out of the very air they rise again. So\nmuch with reference to the deities (mythological). Now then with reference to\nthe body (physiological).\n\n13\\. This Brahman shines forth indeed when one speaks with speech, and it dies\nwhen one does not speak. His splendour goes to the eye alone, the life (pra\n_n_ a) to breath (pra _n_ a).\n\nThis Brahman shines forth indeed when one sees with the eye, and it dies when\none does not see. Its splendour goes to the ear alone, the life (pra _n_ a) to\nbreath (pra _n_ a).\n\nThis Brahman shines forth indeed when one hears with the ear, and it dies when\none does not hear. Its splendour goes to the mind alone, the life (pra _n_ a)\nto breath (pra _n_ a).\n\np. 290\n\nThis Brahman shines forth indeed when one thinks with the mind, and it dies\nwhen one does not think. Its splendour goes to the breath (pra _n_ a) alone,\nand the life (pra _n_ a) to breath (pra _n_ a).\n\nThus all these deities (the senses, &c.), having entered breath or life (pra\n_n_ a) alone, though dead, do not vanish; and out of very breath (pra _n_ a)\nthey rise again. And if two mountains, the southern and northern, were to move\nforward trying to crush him who knows this, they would not crush him. But\nthose who hate him and those whom he hates, they die around him.\n\n14\\. Next follows the Ni _h_ _s_ reyasadana 1 (the accepting of the pre-\neminence of pra _n_ a (breath or life) by the other gods). The deities\n(speech, eye, ear, mind), contending with each for who was the best, went out\nof this body, and the body lay without breathing, withered, like a log of\nwood. Then speech went into it, but speaking by speech, it lay still. Then the\neye went into it, but speaking by speech, and seeing by the eye, it lay still.\nThen the ear went into it, but speaking by speech, seeing by the eye, hearing\nby the car, it lay still. Then mind went into it, but speaking by speech,\nseeing by the eye, hearing by the ear, thinking by the mind, it lay still.\nThen breath (pra _n_ a, life) went into it, and thence it rose at once. All\nthese deities, having recognised the pre-eminence in pra _n_ a, and having\ncomprehended pra _n_ a alone as the conscious self (pra _g_ \xc3\xb1atman) 2, went\nout of this body with all these (five different kinds of\n\np. 291\n\npra _n_ a), and resting in the air (knowing that pra _n_ a had entered the\nair), and merged in the ether (aka _s_ a), they went to heaven. And in the\nsame manner he who knows this, having recognised the pre-eminence in pra _n_\na, and having comprehended pra _n_ a alone as the conscious self (pra _g_\n\xc3\xb1atman), goes out of this body with all these (does no longer believe in this\nbody), and resting in the air, and merged in the ether, he goes to heaven, he\ngoes to where those gods (speech, &c.) are. And having reached this he, who\nknows this, becomes immortal with that immortality which those gods enjoy.\n\n15\\. Next follows the father's tradition to the son, and thus they explain it\n1. The father, when going to depart, calls his son, after having strewn the\nhouse with fresh grass, and having laid the sacrificial fire, and having\nplaced near it a pot of water with a jug (full of rice), himself covered with\na new cloth, and dressed in white. He places himself above his son, touching\nhis organs with his own organs, or he may deliver the tradition to him while\nhe sits before him. Then he delivers it to him. The father says: 'Let me place\nmy speech in thee.' The son says: 'I take thy speech in me.' The father says:\n'Let me place my scent (pra _n_ a) in thee.' The son says: 'I take thy scent\nin me.' The father says: 'Let me place my eye in thee.' The son says: 'I take\nthy eye in me.' The father says: 'Let me place my ear in thee.' The son says:\n'I take thy ear in me.' The father says: 'Let me place my tastes of food in\nthee.' The son says: 'I take thy tastes of food in me.' The father says: 'Let\nme place my actions\n\np. 292\n\nin thee! The son says: 'I take thy actions in me.' The father says: 'Let me\nplace my pleasure and pain in thee.' The son says: 'I take thy pleasure and\npain in me.' The father says: 'Let me place happiness, joy, and offspring in\nthee.' The son says: 'I take thy happiness, joy, and offspring in me.' The\nfather says: 'Let me place my walking in thee.' The son says: 'I take thy\nwalking in me 1.' The father says: 'Let me place my mind in thee.' The son\nsays: 'I take thy mind in me.' The father says: 'Let me place my knowledge\n(pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a) in thee.' The son says: 'I take thy knowledge in me.' But if the\nfather is very ill, he may say shortly: 'Let me place my spirits (pra _n_ as)\nin thee,' and the son: 'I take thy spirits in me.'\n\nThen the son walks round his father keeping his right side towards him, and\ngoes away. The father calls after him: 'May fame, glory of countenance, and\nhonour always follow thee.' Then the other looks back over his left shoulder,\ncovering himself with his hand or the hem of his garment, saying: 'Obtain the\nheavenly worlds (svarga) and all desires.'\n\nIf the father recovers, let him be under the authority of his son, or let him\nwander about (as an ascetic). But if he departs, then let them despatch him,\nas he ought to be despatched, yea, as he ought to be despatched 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[280:1](sbe01240.htm#fr_724) In the first chapter it was said, 'He approaches\nthe couch Amitau _g_ as, that is pra _n_ a, breath, spirit, life. Therefore\nhaving explained in the first adhyaya the knowledge of the couch (of Brahman),\nthe next subject to be explained is the knowledge of pra _n_ a, the living\nspirit, taken for a time as Brahman, or the last cause of everything.'\n\n[281:1](sbe01240.htm#fr_725) I translate vakparastat, _k_ akshu _h_ parastat,\nmana _h_ parastat as compounds, and read _s_ rotraparastat. The commentator\nrequires this. He says that speech is uncertain, and has to be checked by the\neye. The eye is uncertain, taking mother of pearl for silver, and must be\nchecked by the ear. The ear is uncertain, and must be checked by the mind, for\nunless the mind is attentive, the ear hears not. The mind, lastly, depends on\nthe spirit, for without spirit there is no mind. The commentator is right in\nreading rundhe or runddhe instead of rundhate.\n\n[281:2](sbe01240.htm#fr_726) The vital spirits are called the highest\ntreasure, because a man surrenders everything to preserve his vital spirits or\nhis life.\n\n[281:3](sbe01240.htm#fr_727) Cf. Brih. \xc3\x82r. VI, 3, 1.\n\n[282:1](sbe01240.htm#fr_728) As dear as pra _n_ a or life.\n\n[282:2](sbe01240.htm#fr_729) The commentator explains these mysterious\nutterances by: I offer, I throw, in the fire, which is lit by the fuel of thy\nindifference or dislike, in myself, being the object of thy love, speech, the\norgan of speech, of thee, who art going to love me. This one, i. e. I myself,\nor my love, may prosper. Svaha, my speech, may grant approval to the oblation\nof me, the lover.'\n\n[283:1](sbe01240.htm#fr_730) Uktha, a Vedic hymn, has been identified with pra\n_n_ a, breath, in the Ka _n_ va, and other _S_ akhas (Brih. \xc3\x82r. V, 13, 1; Ait.\n\xc3\x82r. II, 1, 2). Here uktha, i. e. the pra _n_ a of the uktha, is further\nidentified with Brahman. As uktha (the hymn) is pra _n_ a, and as the\nsacrifice is performed with hymns, the sacrifice, too, is uktha, and therefore\npra _n_ a, and therefore Brahman. Comm.\n\n[284:1](sbe01240.htm#fr_731) The verbs ar _k_ , yu _g_ , and sannam are not\nused idiomatically, but with reference to the words _ri_ _k_ , ya _g_ us, and\nsaman.\n\n[284:2](sbe01240.htm#fr_732) The commentator explains this somewhat\ndifferently. He takes it to be the object of the last paragraph to show that\nthe Pra _n_ a-vidya can ultimately produce final liberation, and not only\ntemporal rewards. The Adhvaryu priest, he says, takes what is called uktha,\nand has been identified with _Ri_ _k_ , Ya _g_ us, and Saman hymns, all\ncontained in the mouth, as being outwardly the sacrificial fire of the altar,\nbecause that fire cannot be lighted without such hymns. Thus the self of the\nAdhvaryu priest becomes identified, not only with the uktha, the hymns, but\nalso with the sacrificial fire, and he meditates on himself as fire, as hymn\n(uktha), and as breath (pra _n_ a). I read sa esha sarvasyai trayyai vidyaya\natma, esha u evasyatma. Etadatma bhavati ya eva _m_ veda. But if we read\nasyatma, we cannot with the commentator explain it by asya uktayas trayya\natma, but must refer asya to pra _n_ a, breath, life, which is here to be\nidentified with Brahman.\n\n[285:1](sbe01240.htm#fr_733) This is one of the earliest, if not the earliest\nmention of the ya _g_ \xc3\xb1opavita, the sacred cord as worn over the left shoulder\nfor sacrificial purposes; cf. Taitt. Brahm. III, 10, 19, 12.\n\n[286:1](sbe01240.htm#fr_734) This refers to movements of the arm, following\nthe moon and the sun.\n\n[286:2](sbe01240.htm#fr_735) It is extremely difficult to translate the Vedic\nverses which are quoted in the Upanishads. They are sometimes slightly changed\non purpose (see \xc2\xa711), frequently turned from their original purport by the\nauthors of the Upanishads themselves, and then again subjected to the most\nfanciful interpretations by the various commentators on the Upanishads. In our\nparagraph (\xc2\xa7 8) the text followed by the commentator differs from the printed\ntext. The commentator seems to have read: Yat te susima _m_ h _ri_ dayam adhi\n_k_ andramasi _s_ _ri_ tam, tenam _ri_ tatvasye _s_ ane maham pautram agha _m_\nrudam. I have translated according to the commentator, at least up to a\ncertain point, for, as Professor Cowell remarks, there is an undercurrent in\nthe commentator's explanation, implying a comparison between the husband as\nthe sun or fire, and the wife as the moon, which it would be difficult to\nrender in an English translation. The same or a very similar verse occurs in \xc2\xa7\n10, while other modifications of it may be seen in \xc3\x82 _s_ val. G _ri_ hya-\nsutras I, 13, 7, and elsewhere. The translation of the verses in full, of\nthree of which the Upanishad gives the beginnings only, would be according to\nthe commentator: '(O goddess of the moon) who hast obtained immortal joy\nthrough that which is a beautiful (portion of the sun) placed in the moon, and\nfilling thy heart (with pleasure), may I never weep for misfortune concerning\nmy children.'\n\nRv. I, 91, 16; IX, 31, 4. 'O goddess of the moon, increase! may the vigour\nfrom everywhere (from every limb of the fire or the sun) go to thee! Help us\nin the attainment of food.' Rv. I, 91, 18. 'O goddess of the moon, may the\nstreams of thy milk go well to our sons, those streams of milk which are\ninvigorating, and p. 287 help to conquer the enemy. O Soma-goddess, increasing\nfor immortal happiness (for the birth of a son), do thou place the highest\nglory (the streams of thy milk) in the sky.' 'That ray (sushum _n_ a) which\n(as a woman) the \xc3\x82dityas gladden, that Soma which as imperishable the\nimperishable \xc3\x82dityas drink, may the guardian of the world (Pra _g_ apati), B\n_ri_ haspati, and king Varu _n_ a gladden us by it.'\n\nThe translations are made by the commentator regardless of grammar and sense:\nyet they command a certain authority, and must be taken into account as\nthrowing light on the latest development of Indian mysticism.\n\n[288:1](sbe01240.htm#fr_736) Cf. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana G _ri_ hya-sutras I, 13, 7.\n\n[288:2](sbe01240.htm#fr_737) Widely scattered, everywhere desired. Comm.\nProfessor Cowell proposes unscattered, hoarded, or unconcealed.\n\n[288:3](sbe01240.htm#fr_738) The original has asme, to us, not asmai, to him.\n\n[288:4](sbe01240.htm#fr_739) Cf. Taitt. Up. III, 10, 4; Ait. Brahm. V, 28;\nColebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays (1873), II, p. 39.\n\n[290:1](sbe01240.htm#fr_740) For other versions of this story see _Kh_. Up. V,\n1, note 2; Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 1, 4, 9; Brih. \xc3\x82r. VI, 1, 1-14; and Kaush. Up. III, 3.\n\n[290:2](sbe01240.htm#fr_741) Cf. _Kh_. Up. VII, 15, note.\n\n[291:1](sbe01240.htm#fr_742) Cf. B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka I, 5,17.\n\n[292:1](sbe01240.htm#fr_743) Another _s_ akha adds here dhiya _h_ , the\nthoughts (active), vi _g_ \xc3\xb1atavyam, their object, and kama _h_ , desires.\n\n[292:2](sbe01240.htm#fr_744) I have taken samapayati in the sense of\nperforming the last duties towards a dead person, though I confess I know of\nno parallel passage in which samapayati occurs in that sense. Professor Cowell\ntranslates: 'If he dies, then let them cause the son duly to receive the\ntradition, as the tradition is to be given.' The text itself varies, for the\nreading presupposed by the commentator is ena _m_ (putram) samapayati, instead\nof ena _m_ samapayeyu _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Adhyaya III](sbe01241.htm)\n\n"
