GAMBLING AND BETTING.\n\n1. 1 Gambling has been prohibited by Manu, because it destroys truth, honesty, and wealth. It has been permitted by other (legislators) when conducted so as to allow the king a share (of every stake).\n\n2\\. It shall take place under the superintendence of keepers of gaming-houses,\nas it serves the purpose of discovering thieves. The same rule has to be\nobserved in bets on prize-fights with animals.\n\n3. 3 When birds, rams, deer or other (animals) are caused to fight against one another, after a wager has been laid, it is called betting on animals (samahvaya).\n\np. 386\n\n4. 4 When any one is defeated in a prize-fight between two animals, the wager which has been laid shall be paid by the owner of the (defeated) animal.\n\n5\\. A wager (or game) shall be made in public; false gamblers shall be\nbanished.\n\n6. 6 When there is a point at issue between the two parties (in a game or wager, other) gamblers shall examine (and decide) the matter; if they are enemies (of either party), the king shall decide the dispute.\n\n7. 7 One defeated in a secret game; or ignorant of the rules; or (defeated) by the use of false dice, or by deceit, though acquainted with the game, shall be released; and one who has lost his entire wealth in a game shall not be compelled to give the whole of it.\n\n8\\. The keeper of the gaming-house shall receive the stakes and pay the\nvictorious gambler and the king; he shall also act as witness in a dispute,\nassisted by three other gamblers.\n\n9\\. Those wicked men who use false dice in a game, or rob the king of his due,\nor cheat by making false computations, are declared to be gamblers deserving\npunishment.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[385:1](sbe3384.htm#fr_1291) XXVI, 1, 2.
