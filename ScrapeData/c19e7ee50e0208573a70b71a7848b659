XIX.\n\nDialogue between Prahlada and his father: he is cast from the top of the\npalace unhurt: baffles the incantations of Samvara: he is thrown fettered into\nthe sea: he praises Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nWHEN Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu heard that the powerful incantations of his priests had\nbeen defeated, he sent for his son, and demanded of him the secret of his\nextraordinary might. "Prahlada," he said, "thou art possessed of marvellous\npowers; whence are they derived? are they the result of magic rites? or have\nthey accompanied thee from birth?" Prahlada, thus interrogated, bowed down to\nhis father\'s feet, and replied, "Whatever power I possess, father, is neither\nthe result of magic rites, nor is it inseparable from my nature; it is no more\nthan that which is possessed by all in whose hearts Achyuta abides. He who\nmeditates not of wrong to others, but considers them as himself, is free from\nthe effects of sin, inasmuch as the cause does not exist; but he who inflicts\npain upon others, in act, thought, or speech, sows the seed of future birth,\nand the fruit that awaits him after birth is pain. I wish no evil to any, and\ndo and speak no offence; for I behold Ke\xc5\x9bava in all beings, as in my own soul.\nWhence should corporeal or mental suffering or pain, inflicted by elements or\nthe gods, affect me, whose heart is thoroughly purified by him? Love, then,\nfor all creatures will be assiduously cherished by all those who are wise in\nthe knowledge that Hari is all things."\n\nWhen he had thus spoken, the Daitya monarch, his face darkened with fury,\ncommanded his attendants to cast his son from the summit of the palace where\nhe was sitting, and which was many Yojanas in height, down upon the tops of\nthe mountains, where his body should be dashed to pieces against the rocks.\nAccordingly the Daityas hurled the boy down, and he fell cherishing Hari in\nhis heart, and Earth, the nurse of all creatures, received him gently on her\nlap, thus entirely devoted to Ke\xc5\x9bava, the protector of the world.\n\nBeholding him uninjured by the fall, and sound in every bone, Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu\naddressed himself to Samvara, the mightiest of enchanters,\n\np. 138\n\nand said to him, "This perverse boy is not to be destroyed by us: do you, who\nart potent in the arts of delusion, contrive some device for his destruction."\nSamvara replied, "I will destroy him: you shall behold, king of the Daityas,\nthe power of delusion, the thousand and the myriad artifices that it can\nemploy." Then the ignorant Asura Samvara practised subtile wiles for the\nextermination of the firm-minded Prahlada: but he, with a tranquil heart, and\nvoid of malice towards Samvara, directed his thoughts uninterruptedly to the\ndestroyer of Madhu; by whom the excellent discus, the flaming Sudarsana, was\ndispatched to defend the youth; and the thousand devices of the evil-destinied\nSamvara were every one foiled by this defender of the prince. The king of the\nDaityas then commanded the withering wind to breathe its blighting blast upon\nhis son: and, thus commanded, the wind immediately penetrated into his frame,\ncold, cutting, drying, and insufferable. Knowing that the wind had entered\ninto his body, the Daitya boy applied his whole heart to the mighty upholder\nof the earth; and Janarddana, seated in his heart, waxed wroth, and drank up\nthe fearful wind, which had thus hastened to its own annihilation.\n\nWhen the devices of Samvara were all frustrated, and the blighting wind had\nperished, the prudent prince repaired to the residence of his preceptor. His\nteacher instructed him daily in the science of polity, as essential to the\nadministration of government, and invented by U\xc5\x9banas for the benefit of kings;\nand when he thought that the modest prince was well grounded in the principles\nof the science, he told the king that Prahlada was thoroughly conversant with\nthe rules of government as laid down by the descendant of Bhrigu.\nHiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu therefore summoned the prince to his presence, and desired him\nto repeat what he had learned; how a king should conduct himself towards\nfriends or foes; what measures he should adopt at the three periods (of\nadvance, retrogression, or stagnation); how he should treat his councillors,\nhis ministers, the officers of his government and of his household, his\nemissaries, his subjects, those of doubtful allegiance, and his foes; with\nwhom should he contract alliance; with whom engage in war; what sort of\nfortress he should construct; how forest and mountain tribes should be\nreduced;\n\np. 139\n\nhow internal grievances should be rooted out: all this, and what else he had\nstudied, the youth was commanded by his father to explain. To this, Prahlada\nhaving bowed affectionately and reverentially to the feet of the king, touched\nhis forehead, and thus replied:--\n\n"It is true that I have been instructed in all these matters by my venerable\npreceptor, and I have learnt them, but I cannot in all approve them. It is\nsaid that conciliation, gifts, punishment, and sowing dissension are the means\nof securing friends (or overcoming foes) 1; but I, father--be not angry--know\nneither friends nor foes; and where no object is to be accomplished, the means\nof effecting it are superfluous. It were idle to talk of friend or foe in\nGovinda, who is the supreme soul, lord of the world, consisting of the world,\nand who is identical with all beings. The divine Vishn\xcc\x81u is in thee, father,\nin me, and in all every where else; and hence how can I speak of friend or\nfoe, as distinct from myself? It is therefore waste of time to cultivate such\ntedious and unprofitable sciences, which are but false knowledge, and all our\nenergies should be dedicated to the acquirement of true wisdom. The notion\nthat ignorance is knowledge arises, father, from ignorance. Does not the\nchild, king of the Asuras, imagine the fire-fly to be a spark of fire. That is\nactive duty, which is not for our bondage; that is knowledge, which is for our\nliberation: all other duty is good only unto weariness; all other knowledge is\nonly the cleverness of an artist. Knowing this, I look upon all such\nacquirement as profitless. That which is really profitable hear me, oh mighty\nmonarch, thus prostrate before thee, proclaim. He who cares not for dominion,\nhe who cares not for wealth, shall assuredly obtain both in a life to come.\nAll men, illustrious prince, are toiling to be great; but the destinies of\nmen, and not their own exertions, are the cause of greatness. Kingdoms are the\ngifts of fate, and are bestowed upon the stupid, the ignorant, the cowardly,\nand those to whom the science of government is unknown. Let him therefore who\ncovets the goods of fortune be assiduous in the practice of virtue: let him\nwho hopes for final liberation learn to look upon all things as equal and the\n\np. 140\n\nsame. Gods, men, animals, birds, reptiles, all are but forms of one eternal\nVishn\xcc\x81u, existing as it were detached from himself. By him who knows this, all\nthe existing world, fixed or movable, is to be regarded as identical with\nhimself, as proceeding alike from Vishn\xcc\x81u, assuming a universal form. When\nthis is known, the glorious god of all, who is without beginning or end, is\npleased; and when he is pleased, there is an end of affliction."\n\nOn hearing this, Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu started up from his throne in a fury, and\nspurned his son on the breast with his foot. Burning with rage, he wrung his\nhands, and exclaimed, "Ho Viprachitti! ho Rahu! ho Bali 2! bind him with\nstrong bands 3, and cast him into the ocean, or all the regions, the Daityas\nand Danavas, will become converts to the doctrines of this silly wretch.\nRepeatedly prohibited by us, he still persists in the praise of our enemies.\nDeath is the just retribution of the disobedient." The Daityas accordingly\nbound the prince with strong bands, as their lord had commanded, and threw him\ninto the sea. As he floated on the waters, the ocean was convulsed throughout\nits whole extent, and rose in mighty undulations, threatening to submerge the\nearth. This when Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu observed, he commanded the Daityas to hurl\nrocks into the sea, and pile them closely on one another, burying beneath\ntheir incumbent mass him whom fire would not burn, nor weapons pierce, nor\nserpents bite; whom the pestilential gale could not blast, nor poison nor\nmagic spirits nor incantations destroy; who fell from the loftiest heights\nunhurt; who foiled the elephants of the spheres: a son of depraved heart,\nwhose life was a perpetual curse. "Here," he cried, "since he cannot die, here\nlet him live for thousands of years at the bottom of the ocean, overwhelmed by\nmountains. Accordingly the Daityas and Danavas hurled upon Prahlada, whilst in\nthe great ocean, ponderous rocks,\n\np. 141\n\nand piled them over him for many thousand miles: but he, still with mind\nundisturbed, thus offered daily praise to Vishn\xcc\x81u, lying at the bottom of the\nsea, under the mountain heap. "Glory to thee, god of the lotus eye: glory to\nthee, most excellent of spiritual things: glory to thee, soul of all worlds:\nglory to thee, wielder of the sharp discus: glory to the best of Brahmans; to\nthe friend of Brahmans and of kine; to Krishn\xcc\x81a, the preserver of the world:\nto Govinda be glory. To him who, as Brahma, creates the universe; who in its\nexistence is its preserver; be praise. To thee, who at the end of the Kalpa\ntakest the form of Rudra; to thee, who art triform; be adoration. Thou,\nAchyuta, art the gods, Yakshas, demons, saints, serpents, choristers and\ndancers of heaven, goblins, evil spirits, men, animals, birds, insects,\nreptiles, plants, and stones, earth, water, fire, sky, wind, sound, touch,\ntaste, colour, flavour, mind, intellect, soul, time, and the qualities of\nnature: thou art all these, and the chief object of them all. Thou art\nknowledge and ignorance, truth and falsehood, poison and ambrosia. Thou art\nthe performance and discontinuance of acts 4: thou art the acts which the\nVedas enjoin: thou art the enjoyer of the fruit of all acts, and the means by\nwhich they are accomplished. Thou, Vishn\xcc\x81u, who art the soul of all, art the\nfruit of all acts of piety. Thy universal diffusion, indicating might and\ngoodness, is in me, in others, in all creatures, in all worlds. Holy ascetics\nmeditate on thee: pious priests sacrifice to thee. Thou alone, identical with\nthe gods and the fathers of mankind, receivest burnt-offerings and oblations\n5. The universe is thy intellectual form 6; whence proceeded thy subtile form,\nthis world: thence art thou all subtile elements and elementary beings, and\nthe subtile principle, that is called soul, within them. Hence the supreme\nsoul of all objects, distinguished as subtile or gross, which is\nimperceptible, and which cannot be conceived, is even a form of thee. Glory be\nto thee, Purushottama; and\n\np. 142\n\nglory to that imperishable form which, soul of all, is another manifestation 7\nof thy might, the asylum of all qualities, existing in all creatures. I salute\nher, the supreme goddess, who is beyond the senses; whom the mind, the tongue,\ncannot define; who is to be distinguished alone by the wisdom of the truly\nwise. Om! salutation to Vasudeva: to him who is the eternal lord; he from whom\nnothing is distinct; he who is distinct from all. Glory be to the great spirit\nagain and again: to him who is without name or shape; who sole is to be known\nby adoration; whom, in the forms manifested in his descents upon earth, the\ndwellers in heaven adore; for they behold not his inscrutable nature. I\nglorify the supreme deity Vishn\xcc\x81u, the universal witness, who seated\ninternally, beholds the good and ill of all. Glory to that Vishn\xcc\x81u from whom\nthis world is not distinct. May he, ever to be meditated upon as the beginning\nof the universe, have compassion upon me: may he, the supporter of all, in\nwhom every thing is warped and woven 8, undecaying, imperishable, have\ncompassion upon me. Glory, again and again, to that being to whom all returns,\nfrom whom all proceeds; who is all, and in whom all things are: to him whom I\nalso am; for he is every where; and through whom all things are from me. I am\nall things: all things are in me, who am everlasting. I am undecayable, ever\nenduring, the receptacle of the spirit of the supreme. Brahma is my name; the\nsupreme soul, that is before all things, that is after the end of all.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[139:1](vp054.htm#fr_316) These are the four Upayas, \'means of success,\'\nspecified in the Amera-kosha.\n\n[140:2](vp054.htm#fr_317) Celebrated Daityas.
