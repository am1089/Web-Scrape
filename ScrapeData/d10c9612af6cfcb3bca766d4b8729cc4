Clothe thyself, with thy clothing (of light), O sacrificial (god), lord of\nall vigour; and then perform this worship for us.\n\n2\\. Sit down, most youthful god, as our desirable Hot _ri_ , through (our\nprayerful) thoughts [1](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:2:1), O Agni, with thy word\n[2](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:2:2) that goes to heaven.\n\n3\\. The father verily by sacrificing procures (blessings) for the son\n[1](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:3:1), the companion for the companion, the elect\nfriend for the friend.\n\n4\\. May Varu _n_ a, Mitra, Aryaman, triumphant with riches (?)\n[1](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:4:1), sit down on our sacrificial grass as they did\non Manu's.\n\n5\\. O ancient Hot _ri_ , be pleased with this our friendship also, and hear\nthese prayers.\n\n6\\. For whenever we sacrifice constantly [1](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:6:1) to this\nor to that god, in thee alone the sacrificial food is offered.\n\n7\\. May he be dear to us, the lord of the clan, the joy-giving, elect Hot _ri_\n; may we be dear (to him), possessed of a good Agni (i. e. of good fire).\n\n8\\. For the gods, when possessed of a good Agni, have given us excellent\nwealth, and we think ourselves possessed of a good Agni.\n\n9\\. And may there be among us mutual praises of both the mortals, O immortal\none, (and the immortals) [1](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:9:1).\n\n10\\. With all Agnis (i. e. with all thy fires), O Agni, accept this sacrifice\nand this prayer, O young (son) of strength [1](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:10:1).\n\np. 14\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn, as well as the whole collection to which it belongs, is ascribed to\n_S_ una _h_ _s_ epa \xc3\x82 _g_ igarti (comp. 24, 12.13). The metre is Gayatri.\nBergaigne (Recherches sur l'histoire de la Sa _m_ hita, II, 7) divides this\nhymn into T _ri_ _k_ as, with one single verse added at the end. I cannot find\nsufficient evidence for this; the appearance in the Sama-veda (II, 967-9) of a\nT _ri_ _k_ a composed of the verses 10. 6. 7 of our hymn is rather against\nBergaigne's opinion.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Manmabhi _h_ may possibly mean, 'with thy (wise) thoughts;' comp., for\ninstance, III, 11, 8. pari vi _s_ vani sudhita agne _h_ a _s_ yama manmabhi\n_h_ , 'may we obtain every bliss through Agni's (wise) thoughts,' or 'may we\nobtain all the blessings of Agni for our prayers.'\n\nNote 2. Va _k_ as stands for va _k_ asa. See the passages collected by Lanman,\nNoun-Inflection, 562, and comp. Roth, Ueber gewisse Kurzungen des Wortendes im\nVeda, 5; Joh. Schmidt, Die Pluralbildungen der indogermanischen Neutra, 304\nseq. Ludwig also takes va _k_ as as instrumental.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Agni is the father, the mortal whose sacrifice he performs, the son.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Can ri _s_ adas be explained as a compound of ri (Tiefstufe of rai, as\ngu is the Tiefstufe of gau) and * _s_ a\xc2\xb4das, from the root _s_ ad, 'to be\ntriumphant'? Prof. Aufrecht (Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XIV, 83; see also\nNeisser, Bezz. Beitr. XIX, 143) connects ri- with the Greek \xe1\xbc\x90\xcf\x81\xce\xb9\\- (\xe1\xbc\x90\xcf\x81\xce\xb9\xce\xba\xcf\x85\xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb5\xcf\x82)\n&c.); our hypothesis has the advantage of not leaving the limits of Sanskrit.\n--Comp. M. M.'s note on V, 60, 7; Ludwig, Ueber die neuesten Arbeiten auf dem\nGebiete der Rig-veda-Forschung (1893), p. 7.\n\np. 15\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. On _s_ a _s_ vata tana see Lanman, 480, 515, 518.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. The comparison of verse 8 and the expression am _ri_ ta martyanam in\nthe second Pada of this verse seem to show that ubhayesham does not refer to\ntwo classes of mortals, the priests and their patrons, but to the mortals and\nthe immortals. A genitive am _r i_tanam, which would make this meaning quite\nclear, can easily be supplied. A Dvandva compound am _ri_ tamartya\xc2\xb4nam, which\none could feel tempted to conjecture, would have, in my opinion, too modern a\ncharacter.--Prof. Max Muller writes: 'I should prefer am _ri_ ta martyanam,\nnot exactly as a compound, but as standing for am _ri_ tanam martyanam. This\nseems to be Ludwig's opinion too.'\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. In the translation of sahasa _h_ yaho I follow Geldner, Kuhn's\nZeitschrift, XXVIII, 195; Ludwig's translation is similar.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 27](sbe46007.htm)\n\n"
