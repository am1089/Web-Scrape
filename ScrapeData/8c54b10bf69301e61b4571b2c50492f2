'A bull's hide'\xc2\x97this has been declared.\n\n2 2. On that hide the husband makes her sit down and sacrifices, while she\ntakes hold of him, four oblations (with the following formulas),\n\n3\\. 'With god Agni, with the earth-world of the worlds, and the Rig-veda of\nthe Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., svaha!\n\n'With god Vayu, with the air-world of the worlds,\n\np. 42\n\nwith the Ya _g_ ur-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., svaha!\n\n'With god Surya, with the heaven-world of the worlds, with the Sama-veda of\nthe Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., svaha!\n\n'With god _K_ andra, with the world of the quarters (of the horizon) of the\nworlds, with the Brahma-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N.,\nsvaha!'\n\n4\\. Or, 'Bhu _h_! What harm dwells in thee, bringing death to thy husband,\ndeath to thy husband's brother, that I make death-bringing to thy paramour,\nN.N., svaha!'\xc2\x97thus the first (of the before-mentioned formulas) may be joined\nwith the first Mahavyah _ri_ ti, the second with the second, the third with\nthe third, the fourth with (the three Mahavyah _ri_ tis) together.\n\n5\\. With (the verse), 'With no evil eye' (Rig-veda X, 85, 44), let him besmear\n(her) eyes with \xc3\x82 _g_ ya salve.\n\n6\\. (The bridegroom,) having touched the ends of her hair with the three\n(verses), 'How may us the resplendent one . . .' (Rig-veda IV, 31, 1-3),\n\n7\\. And having quickly recited the four verses, 'And those divine medicines'\n(Rig-veda VIII, 18, 8), at the end (of that text) with the word svaha (pours\nout) the remainder on (her) head.\n\n8 8. Here some place a boy of good birth on both sides, in her lap, with this\n(verse), 'Into thy womb' (see below, chap. 19, 6),\n\np. 43\n\n9\\. Or also silently.\n\n10\\. Into this (boy's) joined hands (the bridegroom) gives fruits and causes\n(the Brahma _n_ as) to wish an auspicious day.\n\n11\\. Thus she becomes the mother of male children.\n\n12\\. With the rest of the hymn, 'Stay ye here both' (Rig-veda X, 85, 42 seq.),\nthey make them enter the house.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[41:1](sbe29018.htm#fr_91) 16, 1. In chap. 15, 22 it is said that the bride\narrives at the house; in 16, 12, that she enters the house. Probably we are to\nunderstand, therefore, that the sacrifice prescribed in this chapter, Sutras 2\nseq., is performed before the house, like the Vastoshpatiya karman (below,\nIII, 4). The words, 'has been declared,' refer to the _S_ rauta-sutra (IV, r6,\n2), 'Having spread a red bull's skin, with the neck to the north or to the\neast, with the hair outside, behind the fire, they sit down,' &c.\n\n[41:2](sbe29018.htm#fr_92) On anvarambha comp. the quotation in the note on\nchap. II, 2.\n\n[42:8](sbe29018.htm#fr_93) It should be noted that the verse a te yonim is\nquoted here only with the Pratika, while its full text is given below, chap.\n19, 6. Can the Sutras describing this ceremony with the kumara ubhayata _h_\n-su _g_ ata be a later addition?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 17](sbe29019.htm)\n\n"
