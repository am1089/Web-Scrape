A Brahma _n_ a declares, \'The daily recitation (of the Veda) is\nausterity.\' 1\n\n2\\. In the same (sacred text) it is also declared, Whether he recites the\ndaily portion of the Veda standing, or sitting, or lying down, he performs\nausterity thereby; for the daily recitation is austerity.\' 2\n\n3\\. Now the Va _g_ asaneyi-brahma _n_ a declares also, \'The daily recitation\nis a sacrifice at which the Veda is offered. When it thunders, when lightning\nflashes or thunderbolts fall, and when the wind blows violently, these sounds\ntake the place of the exclamations Vasha _t_ (Vausha _t_ and Svaha). Therefore\nhe shall recite the Veda whilst it thunders, whilst lightning flashes and\nthunderbolts fall, and whilst the wind blows violently, lest the Vasha _t_\n(should be heard) in vain. 3\n\np. 46\n\n4\\. The conclusion of the passage from that (Va _g_ asaneyi-brahma _n_ a is\nfound) in another _S_ akha (of the Veda).\n\n5\\. \'Now, if the wind blows, or if it thunders, or if lightning flashes, or\nthunderbolts fall, then he shall recite one _Ri_ k-verse (in case he studies\nthe Rig-Veda), or one Ya _g_ us (in case he studies the Ya _g_ ur-veda), or\none Saman (in case he studies the Sama-veda), or (without having a regard to\nhis particular Veda, the following Ya _g_ us), "Bhu _h_ Bhuva _h_ , Suva _h_ ,\nin faith I offer true devotion." Then, indeed, his daily recitation is\naccomplished thereby for that day.\' 5\n\n6\\. If that is done, (if the passage of the Va _g_ asaneyi-brahma _n_ a is\ncombined with that quoted in Sutra 5, the former stands) not in contradiction\nwith the decision of the \xc3\x82ryas. 6\n\n7\\. For they (who know the law) teach both the continuance and the\ninterruption (of the daily recitation of the Veda). That would be meaningless,\nif one paid attention to the (passage of the) Va _g_ asaneyi-brahma _n_ a\n(alone).\n\n8\\. For no (worldly) motive for the decision of those \xc3\x82ryas is perceptible;\n(and hence it must have a religious motive and be founded on a passage of the\nVeda). 8\n\n9\\. (The proper interpretation therefore is, that) the prohibition to study\n(given above and by the\n\np. 47\n\n\xc3\x82ryas generally) refers only to the repetition of the sacred texts in order to\nlearn them, not to their application at sacrifices.\n\n10\\. (But if you ask, why the decision of the \xc3\x82ryas presupposes the existence\nof a Vedic passage, then I answer): All precepts were (originally) taught in\nthe Brahma _n_ as, (but) these texts have been lost. Their (former existence)\nmay, however, be inferred from usage. 10\n\n11\\. But it is not (permissible to infer the former existence of) a (Vedic)\npassage in cases where pleasure is obtained (by following a rule of the Sm\n_ri_ ti or a custom). 11\n\n12\\. He who follows such (usages) becomes fit for hell.\n\n13\\. Now follow (some rites and) rules that have been declared in the Brahma\n_n_ as. 13\n\n14\\. By way of laudation they are called \'great sacrifices \' or \'great\nsacrificial sessions.\' 14\n\n15\\. (These rites include): The daily Bali-offering\n\np. 48\n\nto the (seven classes of) beings; the (daily) gift of (food) to men according\nto one\'s power;\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[45:1](sbe0215.htm#fr_302) **12**. \'It procures as much reward as penance.\'--\nHaradatta. Manu II, 166; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 113. The phrase occurs\nfrequently in the Brahma _n_ as, e.g. Taitt. \xc3\x82r. II, 14, 3.\n\n[45:2](sbe0215.htm#fr_303) Regarding the proper position at the \'Veda-\noffering,\' or daily recitation, see above, I, 3, 11, 2 3, and Taitt. \xc3\x82r. II,\n11, 3. Passages similar to the first part of the sentence quoted in this Sutra\noccur Taitt. \xc3\x82r II, 12, 3, and 15, 3. It ought to be observed that the Taitt.\n\xc3\x82r. in both places has the word \'vra _g_ an,\' which is also read in the P. and\nP. U. MSS. The second part is taken apparently from the same work, II, 14, 2.\n\n[45:3](sbe0215.htm#fr_304) See _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a XI, 5, 6, 8, where a\npassage very similar to that quoted by \xc3\x82pastamba occurs. Vasha _t_ and the\nother exclamations, which are pronounced by the Hot _ri_ -priest, serve as\nsignals for the Adhvaryu to throw the oblations into the fire.\n\n[46:5](sbe0215.htm#fr_305) \'Some suppose that the words Bhu _h_ Bhuva _h_ and\nSuva _h_ &c. (are to be used only) if one studies the Brahma _n_ a portion of\nthe Veda, not every where.\'-- Haradatta.\n\n[46:6](sbe0215.htm#fr_306) Haradatta explains \xc3\x82ryas by vi _s_ ish _t_ a _h_ ,\n\'excellent ones,\' i.e. persons who know the law, and he gives Manu as an\ninstance.\n\n[46:8](sbe0215.htm#fr_307) See above, I, 1, 4, 9 and 10. and notes.\n\n[47:10](sbe0215.htm#fr_308) How then is their existence known? \'They are\ninferred from usage.\' \'"Usage" means the teaching of the law-books and the\npractice. From that it is inferred that Manu and other (authors of law-books)\nknew such texts of the Brahma _n_ as. For how could otherwise ( _Ri_ shis like\nManu) teach in their works or practise (such customs) for which no authority\nis now found? And certainly they were intimately connected with the revealed\ntexts (i.e. saw them).\'-- Haradatta.\n\n[47:11](sbe0215.htm#fr_309) Compare above, I, 1, 4, 8-10.\n\n[47:13](sbe0215.htm#fr_310) The consequence of the introduction of these rules\ninto a Sm _ri_ ti work is, that their omission must be expiated by a Smarta\npenance and not by a _S_ rauta one.\n\n[47:14](sbe0215.htm#fr_311) The commentator observes, that, as these rites are\ncalled \'great sacrifices,\' by way of laudation only, the particular laws\nbinding on performers of real Soma-sacrifices cannot be transferred to the\nperformers of these ceremonies. Regarding the p. 48 term \'great sacrifices,\'\nsee also Taitt. \xc3\x82r. II, 11, 10, 1 seq., and _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a XI, 59\n6, 1.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 4, Kha _n_ _d_ a 13](sbe0216.htm)\n\n'
