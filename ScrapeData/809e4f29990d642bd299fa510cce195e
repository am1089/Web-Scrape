He who, under any conditions whatsoever, covets (and takes) another man's\npossessions is a thief; thus (teach) Kautsa and Harita as well as Ka _n_ va\nand Pushkarasadi.\n\n2\\. Varshyaya _n_ i declares, that there are exceptions to this law, in regard\nto some possessions.\n\n3\\. (E.g.) seeds ripening in the pod, food for a draught-ox; (if these are\ntaken), the owners (ought) not (to) forbid it. 3\n\n4\\. To take even these things in too great a quantity is sinful.\n\n5\\. Harita declares, that in every case the permission (of the owner must be\nobtained) first.\n\n6\\. He shall not go to visit a fallen teacher or blood relation.\n\n7\\. Nor shall he accept the (means for procuring) enjoyments from such a\nperson. 7\n\n8\\. If he meets them accidentally he shall silently embrace (their feet) and\npass on.\n\n9\\. A mother does very many acts for her son, therefore he must constantly\nserve her, though she be fallen.\n\n10\\. But (there shall be) no communion (with a fallen mother) in acts\nperformed for the acquisition of spiritual merit.\n\np. 89\n\n11\\. Enjoyments taken unrighteously he shall give up; he shall say, 'I and sin\n(do not dwell together).' Clothing himself with a garment reaching from the\nnavel down to the knee, bathing daily, morn, noon, and evening, eating food\nwhich contains neither milk nor pungent condiments, nor salt, he shall not\nenter a house for twelve years. 11\n\n12\\. After that he (may be) purified.\n\n13\\. Then he may have intercourse with Aryans.\n\n14\\. This penance may also be employed in the case of the other crimes which\ncause loss of caste (for which no penance has been ordained above).\n\n15\\. But the violator of a Guru's bed shall enter a hollow iron image and,\nhaving caused a fire to be lit on both sides, he shall burn himself. 15\n\n16\\. According to Harita, this (last-mentioned penance must) not (be\nperformed).\n\n17\\. For he who takes his own or another's life becomes an Abhi _s_ asta.\n\n18\\. He (the violator of a Guru's bed) shall perform to his last breath (the\npenance) prescribed by that rule (Sutra 11). He cannot be purified in this\nworld. But (after death) his sin is taken away.\n\n19\\. He who has unjustly forsaken his wife shall put on an ass's skin, with\nthe hair turned outside, and beg in seven houses, saying, 'Give alms to him\nwho forsook his wife.' That shall be his livelihood for six months.\n\n20\\. But if a wife forsakes her husband, she shall\n\np. 90\n\nperform the twelve-night K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance for as long a time.\n\n21\\. He who has killed a Bhru _n_ a (a man learned in the Vedas and Veda\xe1\xb9\x85gas\nand skilled in the performance of the rites) shall put on the skin of a dog or\nof an ass, with the hair turned outside, and take a human skull for his\ndrinking-vessel,\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[88:3](sbe0231.htm#fr_491) **28**. The same rule Manu emphatically ascribes to\nhimself, Manu VIII, 339, But see also VIII, 331.\n\n[88:7](sbe0231.htm#fr_492) Haradatta remarks, that this Sutra implicitly\nforbids to accept the heritage of an outcast.\n\n[89:11](sbe0231.htm#fr_493) A similar but easier penance is prescribed, Manu\nXI, 19 4.\n\n[89:15](sbe0231.htm#fr_494) '(This penance, which had been prescribed above,\nI, 9, 25, 1), is enjoined (once more), in order to show that it is not\noptional (as might be expected according to Sutra 14).'--Haradatta.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 10, Kha _n_ _d_ a 29](sbe0232.htm)\n\n"
