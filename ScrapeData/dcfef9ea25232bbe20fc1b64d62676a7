We pray thee, tell,  \nWe wish to know thee, gentle youth;  \nCome, tell us, if thou wilt, the truth.'  \n\nHe gazed upon that sight he ne'er  \nHad seen before, of girls so fair,  \nAnd out of love a longing rose  \nHis sire and lineage to disclose:  \n'My father,' thus he made reply,  \n'Is Kas'yap's son, a saint most high,  \nVibhandak styled; from him I came,  \nAnd Rishya\xc2\x9cring he calls my name,  \nOur hermit cot is near this place:  \nCome thither, O ye fair of face;  \nThere be it mine, with honour due,  \nYe gentle youths, to welcome you.'  \n\nThey heard his speech, and gave consent,  \nAnd gladly to his cottage went.  \nVibhandak's son received them well  \nBeneath the shelter of his cell  \nWith guest-gift, water for their feet,  \nAnd woodland fruit and roots to eat,  \nThey smiled, and spoke sweet words like these,  \nDelighted with his courtesies:  \n'We too have goodly fruit in store,  \nGrown on the trees that shade our door;  \nCome, if thou wilt, kind Hermit, haste  \nThe produce of our grove to taste;  \nAnd let, O good Ascetic, first  \nThis holy water quench thy thirst.'  \nThey spoke, and gave him comfits sweet  \nPrepared ripe fruits to counterfeit;  \nAnd many a dainty cake beside  \nAnd luscious mead their stores supplied.  \nThe seeming fruits, in taste and look,  \nThe unsuspecting hermit took,  \nFor, strange to him, their form beguiled  \nThe dweller in the lonely wild.  \nThen round his neck fair arms were flung,  \nAnd there the laughing damsels clung,  \nAnd pressing nearer and more near  \nWith sweet lips whispered at his ear;  \nWhile rounded limb and swelling breast  \nThe youthful hermit softly pressed.  \nThe pleasing charm of that strange bowl,  \n   The touch of a tender limb,  \nOver his yielding spirit stole  \n   And sweetly vanquished him.  \nBut vows, they said, must now be paid;  \n   They bade the boy farewell,  \nAnd, of the aged saint afraid,  \n   Prepared to leave the dell.  \nWith ready guile they told him where  \n   Their hermit dwelling lay:  \nThen, lest the sire should find them there,  \n   Sped by wild paths away.  \nThey fled and left him there alone  \n   By longing love possessed;  \nAnd with a heart no more his own  \n   He roamed about distressed.  \nThe aged saint came home, to find  \n   The hermit boy distraught,  \nRevolving in his troubled mind  \n   One solitary thought.  \n'Why dost thou not, my son,' he cried,  \n   'Thy due obeisance pay?  \nWhy do I see thee in the tide  \n   Of whelming thought to-day?  \nA devotee should never wear  \n   A mien so sad and strange.  \nCome, quickly, dearest child, declare  \n   The reason of the change.'  \nAnd Rishyas'ring, when questioned thus,  \n   Made answer in this wise:  \n'O sire, there came to visit us  \n   Some men with lovely eyes.  \nAbout my neck soft arms they wound  \n   And kept me tightly held  \nTo tender breasts so soft and round,  \n   That strangely heaved and swelled.  \nThey sing more sweetly as they dance  \n   Than e'er I heard till now,  \nAnd play with many a sidelong glance  \n   And arching of the brow.'  \n'My son,' said he, 'thus giants roam  \n   Where holy hermits are,  \nAnd wander round their peaceful home  \n   Their rites austere to mar.  \nI charge thee, thou must never lay  \n   Thy trust in them, dear boy:  \nThey seek thee only to betray,  \n   And woo but to destroy.'  \nThus having warned him of his foes  \n   That night at home he spent.  \nAnd when the morrow's sun arose  \n\np. 18  \n\n   Forth to the forest went.  \n\nBut Rishyas'ring with eager pace  \nSped forth and hurried to the place  \nWhere he those visitants had seen  \nOf daintly waist and charming mien.  \nWhen from afar they saw the son  \nOf Saint Vibhandak toward them run,  \nTo meet the hermit boy they hied,  \nAnd hailed him with a smile, and cried:  \n'O come, we pray, dear lord, behold  \nOur lovely home of which we told  \nDue honour there to thee we'll pay,  \nAnd speed thee on thy homeward way.'  \nPleased with the gracious words they said  \nHe followed where the damsels led.  \nAs with his guides his steps he bent,  \n   That Brahman high of worth,  \nA flood of rain from heaven was sent  \n   That gladdened all the earth.  \n\nVibhandak took his homeward road,  \nAnd wearied by the heavy load  \nOf roots and woodland fruit he bore  \nEntered at last his cottage door.  \nFain for his son he looked around,  \nBut desolate the cell he found.  \nHe stayed not then to bathe his feet,  \nThough fainting with the toil and heat,  \nBut hurried forth and roamed about  \nCalling the boy with cry and shout,  \nHe searched the wood, but all in vain;  \nNor tidings of his son could gain.  \n\nOne day beyond the forest's bound  \nThe wandering saint a village found,  \nAnd asked the swains and neatherds there  \nWho owned the land so rich and fair,  \nWith all the hamlets of the plain,  \nAnd herds of kine and fields of grain.  \nThey listened to the hermit's words,  \nAnd all the guardians of the herds,  \nWith suppliant hands together pressed,  \nThis answer to the saint addressed:  \nThe Angas' lord who bears the name  \nOf Lomapad, renowned by fame,  \nBestowed these hamlets with their kine  \nAnd all their riches, as a sign  \nOf grace, on Rishyas'ring: and he  \nVibhandak's son is said to be.'  \nThe hermit with exulting breast  \nThe mighty will of fate confessed,  \nBy meditation's eye discerned;  \nAnd cheerful to his home returned.  \n\nA stately ship, at early morn,  \nThe hermit's son away had borne.  \nLoud roared the clouds, as on he sped,  \nThe sky grew blacker overhead;  \nTill, as he reached the royal town,  \nA mighty flood of rain came down.  \nBy the great rain the monarch's mind  \nThe coming of his guest divined.  \nTo meet the honoured youth he went,  \nAnd low to earth his head he bent.  \nWith his own priest to lead the train,  \nHe gave the gift high guests obtain.  \nAnd sought, with all who dwelt within  \nThe city walls, his grace to win.  \nHe fed him with the daintiest fare,  \nHe served him with unceasing care,  \nAnd ministered with anxious eyes  \nLest anger in his breast should rise;  \nAnd gave to be the Brahman's bride  \nHis own fair daughter, lotus-eyed.  \n\nThus loved and honoured by the king,  \nThe glorious Brahman Rishyas'ring  \nPassed in that royal town his life  \nWith S'anta his beloved wife.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[16:1](ry011.htm#fr_81) The Koil or _kokila_ (Cuculus Indicus) as the\nharbinger of spring and love is a universal favourite with Indian poets. His\nvoice when first heard in a glorious spring morning is not unpleasant, but\nbecomes in the hot season intolerably wearisome to European ears.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto X.: Rishyas'ring Invited.](ry012.htm)\n\n"
