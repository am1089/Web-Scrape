Now hear the wonderful movements of the\nplanets and their positions. The auspicious and inauspicious events of the\nmankind, are due to the different movements of these planets. As in a potter\xc2\x92s\nwheel going round and round, the motion of the insects crawling on the wheel,\nappears in a contrary direction, so the motion of the Sun and other planets\nmoving on the Zodiac composed of the Ra _s i_s (12 constellations) which again\nalways moves round the Meru as an axle, appears different. Their motion from\none star to\n\n\n\np. 776\n\n\n\nanother and from one constellation to another appears so likewise. These two\nmotions therefore are not contradictory but are consistent; so it is settled\neverywhere by the learned Pundits (as being subservient to the Zodiac). O\nNarada! He, Who is the Origin of all, Who is the \xc3\x82di Puru _s_ a, from Whom all\nthese have sprung, Who is endowed with six extraordinary powers, in Whom all\nthis Prapa\xc3\xb1cha, this material world composed of the five elements remains,\nthat Naraya _n_ a, roaming about, has divided the Trayi \xc3\x82tma into twelve parts\nfor the perfect happiness of all and for Karma S\xc2\x92uddhis (the purification of\nKarma, acts). The sages furnished with J\xc3\xb1an and Vij\xc3\xb1ana have thus argued on\nthe point, following the path as laid out in the Vedas. The Surya Naraya _n_\na, moving on in the six seasons, spring, etc., has established, cold, heat,\netc., as the Dharma of the seasons, duly for the fructification of the Karmas\nof the individual beings. Those persons that worship this \xc3\x82dipuru _s_ a, with\ndevotion, according to the knowledge of the Vedas the customs and usages of\nVar _n_ a (castes) and \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama (Brahmacharya, etc.), and with various\nperformances of Yogas, get their fruits respectively according to their\ndesires. This Sun is the \xc3\x82tman of all the Lokas and resting on the Zodiac\nbetween the Heavens and the Earth, enjoys the twelve months in the twelve\nconstellations, Aries, etc. These months are the limbs of the year. Two\nfortnights make one month. The 21 asterisms go to form one month according to\nthe Solar measure, of the day and night.\n\n\n\nThe period that the Sun takes to travel over the two constellations is called\nRitu or the Season (i.e., two months). The Scientists say that this season is\nthe limb of one Samvatsara. The path that the Sun describes within the three\nseasons or half the year in the Zodiac is called one Ayanam. The time taken by\nthe Sun with earth and heavens to make a circuit of the Zodiac is called one\nVatsara or year. This year is reckoned into five divisions as :-- Samvatsara,\nParivatsara, I _d_ avatsara, A _n_ uvatsara, and Idvatsara. These are\nfunctioned by the S\xc2\x92ighra, Ma _nd_ a, and uniform motions of the Sun. So the\nMunis say. Thus far the motion of the Sun has been described. Now hear that of\nthe Moon. The Moon is situated one lakh Yoyanas higher than the Sun and shares\nwith the motion of the Sun for one year; and She enjoys as well every month\nwith the Sun in the shape of the dark and bright fortnights. The Moon, the\nLord of Night and of the medicinal plants also enjoys the day and night by the\nhelp of one constellation or 2\xc2\xbc Nak _s_ attras. Thus, by Her S\xc2\x92ighragati, the\nMoon enjoys the Nak _s_ attras. During the bright fortnight, the Moon becomes\nmore and more visible and gives pleasure to the Immortals by Her increasing\nphases; and, during the\n\n\n\np. 777\n\n\n\ndark fortnight by Her waning phases, She delights the Pitris. She performs\nrevolution in the day and night by Her both the phases of the bright and dark\nfortnights. Thus She becomes the Life and Soul of\n\nall the living beings. The Moon, endowed with the highest prosperity, travels\none Nak _s_ attra in thirty Muhurtas. She is Full and the Soul without any\nbeginning. She fructifies the desires (Sankalpas) and\n\nresolves of all; hence She is called Manomaya. She is the Lord of all the\nmedicinal plants (O _s_ adhis); hence She is called Annamaya. She is filled\nwith nectar; hence She is called the Abode of Immortality and She gives Nirva\n_n_ a (the final liberation) to all. Hence She is called Sudhakara. She\nnourishes and satisfies the Devas, Pitris, men, reptiles and trees; hence She\nis called \xc2\x93Sarvamaya.\xc2\x94 By Her influence the asterisms travel over the three\nlakh Yoyanas. The God Himself has made the Nak _s_ attra Abhijit to revolve\nround the Meru, along with the other Nak _s_ attras in the Zodiac; so this is\nreckoned as the twenty-eighth Nak _s_ attra. The planet Venus (S\xc2\x92ukra) is\nsituated above the Moon two lakh Yoyanas high. He sometimes goes before the\nSun, sometimes behind and sometimes along with Him. He is very powerful. His\nmotion is of three kinds :-- (1) S\xc2\x92ighra, (2) Ma _nd_ a, and (3) uniform. He\nis generally favourable to all the persons and does for them many auspicious\nthings. So it is stated in the S\xc2\x92astras. O Muni! S\xc2\x92ukra, the illustrious scion\nof Bhrigu, removes the obstacles to the rains. Next to S\xc2\x92ukra, the planet\nMercury (Budha) is situated two lakh Yoyanas high. Like S\xc2\x92ukra, he, too, goes\nsometimes in front sometimes behind and sometimes along with the Sun. And his\nmotion too, is of three kinds :-- S\xc2\x92ighra, Ma _nd_ a, and uniform. When\nMercury the Son of Moon, is away from the Sun, then Ativata (strong winds,\nhurricanes), Abhrapata (the falling of meteors from the clouds) and draught\nand other fears arise. The planet Mars, the son of the Earth is situated two\nlakh Yoyanas higher. Within three fortnights (45 days) he travels one Ras\xc2\x92i.\nThis occurs when his motion is not retrograde. This Mars causes all sorts of\nmischief, evils, and miseries to mankind. The planet Jupiter is situated two\nlakh Yoyanas higher. He passes through one Ras\xc2\x92i in one year. When his motion\nis not retrograde, he is always in favour with the Brahma Vadis. Next to\nBrihaspati, come the planet Saturn, the son of the Sun, two lakh Yoyanas\nhigher. He takes thirty months to pass over one Ras\xc2\x92i. This planet causes all\nsorts of unrest and miseries to all. Therefore He is called a Ma _nd_ a Graha\n(a malefic planet). Next to it, is situated the Saptar _s_ i ma _nd_ ala, the\nGreat Bear, eleven lakh Yoyanas higher up. O Muni! The seven planets always do\nspecial favours to all. These circumambulate the Vi _sn_ upada, the Polar\nStar.\n\n\n\np. 778\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixteenth Chapter in the Eighth Book on the motion of the\nplanets in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 17](bk08ch17.htm)\n\n'
