Now, in performing that sacrifice, they slay it; and in pressing\nout the king (Soma), they slay him; and in quieting and immolating the victim,\nthey slay it. The havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a they slay with the mortar and pestle, and\nwith the two mill-stones.\n\n2:2:2:22\\. When slain, that sacrifice was no longer vigorous. By means of\ndakshi _n_ as (gifts to the priests) the gods again invigorated it: hence the\nname dakshi _n_ a, because thereby they invigorated (dakshay) that\n\np. 309\n\n[paragraph continues] (sacrifice). Whatever, therefore, fails in this\nsacrifice when slain, that he now again invigorates by means of gifts to the\npriests; whereupon the sacrifice becomes successful: for this reason he makes\ngifts to the priests.\n\n2:2:2:33\\. He may give six (cows) 1; for six seasons, indeed, there are in the\nyear, and the sacrifice, Pra _g_ apati, is the year: thus as great as the\nsacrifice is, as large as its extent is, by so many (gifts, dakshi _n_ as)\ndoes he thereby invigorate it.\n\n2:2:2:44\\. He may give twelve; for twelve months there are in the year, and\nthe sacrifice, Pra _g_ apati, is the year: thus as great as the sacrifice is,\nas large as its extent is, by so many (gifts) does he thereby invigorate it.\n\n2:2:2:55\\. He may give twenty-four; for twenty-four half-moons there are in\nthe year, and the sacrifice, Pra _g_ apati, is the year: thus as great as the\nsacrifice is, as large as its extent is, by so many (gifts) does he thereby\ninvigorate it. Such is the measure of the priests' fees; but he may give more,\naccording to (the depth of) his faith. The reason why he gives fees to the\npriests is this.\n\n2:2:2:66\\. Verily, there are two kinds of gods; for, indeed, the gods are the\ngods; and the Brahmans who have studied and teach sacred lore are the human\ngods. The sacrifice of these is divided into two kinds: oblations constitute\nthe sacrifice to the gods; and gifts to the priests that to the human gods,\n\np. 310\n\nthe Brahmans who have studied and teach sacred lore. With oblations one\ngratifies the gods, and with gifts to the priests the human gods, the Brahmans\nwho have studied and teach sacred lore. Both these kinds of gods, when\ngratified, place him in a state of bliss (sudha) 1.\n\n2:2:2:77\\. Even as seed is poured into the womb, so the officiating priests\nplace the sacrificer in the (heavenly) world 2, when he now makes gifts to\nthose who, he hopes, will make him go thither. Such, then, (is the manner) of\ngifts to priests.\n\n2:2:2:88\\. Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_\napati, were contending with each other. They were both soulless, for they were\nmortal, and he who is mortal is soulless. Among these two (classes of beings)\nwho were mortal, Agni alone was immortal; and it was through him, the\nimmortal, that they both lived. Now whichsoever (of the gods) they (the\nAsuras) slew, he, indeed, was so (slain).\n\n2:2:2:99\\. Thereupon the gods were left inferior. They went on praising and\npractising austerities, hoping that they might be able to overcome their\nenemies, the mortal Asuras. They beheld this immortal Agnyadheya (consecrated\nfire).\n\n2:2:2:1010\\. They said, 'Come, let us place that immortal element in our\ninnermost soul! When we have placed that immortal element in our innermost\nsoul, and become immortal and unconquerable, we shall overcome our\nconquerable, mortal enemies.'\n\np. 311\n\n2:2:2:1111\\. They said, 'With both of us is this fire (Agni): let us then\ntreat openly with the Asuras 1.'\n\n2:2:2:1212\\. They said, 'We shall set up (or, establish within ourselves,\na-dha) the two fires,--what will ye do then?'\n\n2:2:2:1313\\. They replied, 'Then we shall lay it down (ni-dha), saying, Eat\ngrass here! eat wood here! cook pap here! cook meat here!' Now that fire,\nwhich the Asuras thus laid down, is this same (fire) wherewith men prepare\ntheir food.\n\n2:2:2:1414\\. The gods then established that (fire) in their innermost soul;\nand having established that immortal element in their innermost soul, and\nbecome immortal and unconquerable, they overcame their mortal, conquerable\nenemies. And so this one now establishes that immortal element in his\ninnermost soul; and--though there is for him no hope of immortality--he\nobtains the full measure of life; for, indeed, he becomes unconquerable, and\nhis enemy, though striving to conquer, conquers him not. And, accordingly,\nwhen one who has established his fires and one who has not established his\nfires, vie with each other, he who has established his fires overcomes the\nother, for, verily, he thereby becomes unconquerable, he thereby becomes\nimmortal.\n\n2:2:2:1515\\. Now, when, on that occasion, they produce that (fire) by\nchurning, then he (the sacrificer) breathes (blows) upon it, when produced;\nfor fire indeed is breath: he thereby produces the one thus produced. He again\ndraws in his breath: thereby he establishes that (fire) in his innermost soul;\nand that fire thus becomes established in his innermost soul 2.\n\np. 312\n\n2:2:2:1616\\. Having kindled it, he makes it blaze, thinking, 'Herein I will\nworship, herein I will perform the sacred work!' Thereby he makes blaze that\nfire which has been established in his innermost soul.\n\n2:2:2:1717\\. 'It (or some one) might come between,--it might go away!' so\n(fear some) 1; but, surely, as long as he lives no one comes between him and\nthat fire which has been established in his innermost soul: let him,\ntherefore, not heed this. And as to its becoming extinguished:--surely, as\nlong as he lives, that fire which has been established in his innermost soul,\ndoes not become extinct in him.\n\n2:2:2:1818\\. The (sacrificial) fires, assuredly, are those breaths: the\n\xc3\x82havaniya and Garhapatya are the out-breathing and the in-breathing; and the\nAnvaharya-pa _k_ ana is the through-breathing.\n\n2:2:2:1919\\. Now, attendance on (or, the worship of) that consecrated fire\n(agnyadheya) means (speaking) the truth. Whosoever speaks the truth, acts as\nif he sprinkled that lighted fire with ghee; for even so does he enkindle it:\nand ever the more increases his own vital energy, and day by day does he\nbecome better. And whosoever speaks the untruth, acts as\n\np. 313\n\nif he sprinkled that lighted fire with water; for even so does he enfeeble it:\nand ever the less becomes his own vital energy, and day by day does he become\nmore wicked. Let him, therefore, speak nothing but the truth.\n\n2:2:2:2020\\. Now the kinsmen spake unto Aru _n_ a Aupave _s_ i, 'Thou art\nadvanced in years: establish thou the two fires!' He replied, 'Speak ye not\nthus! be thou a restrainer of speech [1](sbe1246.htm#fn_706); for he who has\nestablished the fires must not speak an untruth: let him rather not speak at\nall, but let him not speak an untruth. Worship, above all, is truthfulness.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[309:1](sbe1245.htm#fr_704) Viz. at the tanuhavir-ish _t_ is together, or at\nleast three cows at each ish _t_ i if there are two ish _t_ is.

The Ka _n_ va\nrecension has the following more explicit paragraphs instead:--As to this,\nthere is a source of anxiety (agas) to some, fearing that 'it (that fire)\nmight go out (anvagan).' But let him not heed this, for, assuredly, that fire\nof his, which has been established in his innermost soul, does not go out.\n'The carriage might pass through (vyayasit), the cart might pass through;--it\n(or some one) may come between (me and the fire)!' such is another source of\nanxiety to some; but let him not heed this either; for, assuredly, the\ncarriage does not pass through, the cart does not pass through that fire of\nhis which has been established in his innermost soul.
