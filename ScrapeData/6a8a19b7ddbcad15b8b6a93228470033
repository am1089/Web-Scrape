XVII.\n\nLegend of Prahlada. Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu, the sovereign of the universe: the gods\ndispersed or in servitude to him: Prahlada, his son, remains devoted to\nVishn\xcc\x81u: questioned by his father, he praises Vishn\xcc\x81u: Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu orders\nhim to be put to death, but in vain: his repeated deliverance: he teaches his\ncompanions to adore Vishn\xcc\x81u.?\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Listen, Maitreya, to the story of the wise and magnanimous\nPrahlada, whose adventures are ever interesting and instructive.\nHiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu, the son of Diti, had formerly brought the three worlds under\nhis authority, confiding in a boon bestowed upon him by Brahma 1. He had\nusurped the sovereignty of Indra, and exercised of himself the functions of\nthe sun, of air, of the lord of waters, of fire, and of the moon. He himself\nwas the god of riches; he was the judge of the dead; and he appropriated to\nhimself, without reserve, all that was offered in sacrifice to the gods. The\ndeities therefore, flying from their seats in heaven, wandered, through fear\nof the Daitya, upon the earth, disguised in mortal shapes. Having conquered\nthe three worlds, he was inflated with pride, and, eulogized by the\nGandharbas, enjoyed whatever he desired. The Gandharbas, the Siddhas, and the\nsnake-gods all attended upon the mighty Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu, as he sat at the\nbanquet. The Siddhas delighted stood before him, some playing on musical\ninstruments, some singing songs in his praise, and others shouting cries of\nvictory; whilst the nymphs of heaven danced gracefully in the crystal palace,\nwhere the Asura with pleasure quaffed the inebriating cup.\n\nThe illustrious son of the Daitya king, Prahlada, being yet a boy, resided in\nthe dwelling of his preceptor, where he read such writings as are studied in\nearly years. On one occasion he came, accompanied by his teacher, to the court\nof his father, and bowed before his feet as he was drinking. Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu\ndesired his prostrate son to rise, and said\n\np. 127\n\nto him, "Repeat, boy, in substance, and agreeably, what during the period of\nyour studies you have acquired." "Hear, sire," replied Prahlada, "what in\nobedience to your commands I will repeat, the substance of all I have learned:\nlisten attentively to that which wholly occupies my thoughts. I have learned\nto adore him who is without beginning, middle, or end, increase or diminution;\nthe imperishable lord of the world, the universal cause of causes." On hearing\nthese words, the sovereign of the Daityas, his eyes red with wrath, and lip\nswollen with indignation, turned to the preceptor of his son, and said, "Vile\nBrahman, what is this preposterous commendation of my foe, that, in disrespect\nto me, you have taught this boy to utter?" "King of the Daityas," replied the\nGuru, "it is not worthy of you to give way to passion: that which your son has\nuttered, he has not been taught by me." "By whom then," said Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu to\nthe lad, "by whom has this lesson, boy, been taught you? your teacher denies\nthat it proceeds from him." "Vishn\xcc\x81u, father," answered Prahlada, "is the\ninstructor of the whole world: what else should any one teach or learn, save\nhim the supreme spirit?" "Blockhead," exclaimed the king, "who is this\nVishn\xcc\x81u, whose name you thus reiterate so impertinently before me, who am the\nsovereign of the three worlds?" "The glory of Vishn\xcc\x81u," replied Prahlada, "is\nto be meditated upon by the devout; it cannot be described: he is the supreme\nlord, who is all things, and from whom all things proceed." To this the king\nrejoined, "Are you desirous of death, fool, that you give the title of supreme\nlord to any one whilst I survive?" "Vishn\xcc\x81u, who is Brahma," said Prahlada,\n"is the creator and protector, not of me alone, but of all human beings, and\neven, father, of you: he is the supreme lord of all. Why should you, sire, be\noffended?" Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu then exclaimed, "What evil spirit has entered into\nthe breast of this silly boy, that thus, like one possessed, he utters such\nprofanity?" "Not into my heart alone," said Prahlada, "has Vishn\xcc\x81u entered,\nbut he pervades all the regions of the universe, and by his omnipresence\ninfluences the conduct of all beings, mine, fattier, and thine 2." "Away with\nthe wretch!" cried\n\np. 128\n\nthe king; "take him to his preceptor\'s mansion. By whom could he have been\ninstigated to repeat the lying praises of my foe?"\n\nAccording to the commands of his father, Prahlada was conducted by the Daityas\nback to the house of his Guru; where, assiduous in attendance on his\npreceptor, he constantly improved in wisdom. After a considerable time had\nelapsed, the sovereign of the Asuras sent for him again; and on his arrival in\nhis presence, desired him to recite some poetical composition. Prahlada\nimmediately began, "May he from whom matter and soul originate, from whom all\nthat moves or is unconscious proceeds, he who is the cause of all this\ncreation, Vishn\xcc\x81u, be favourable unto us!" On hearing which, Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu\nexclaimed, "Kill the wretch! he is not fit to live, who is a traitor to his\nfriends, a burning brand to his own race!" and his attendants, obedient to his\norders, snatched up their weapons, and rushed in crowds upon Prahlada, to\ndestroy him. The prince calmly looked upon them, and said, "Daityas, as truly\nas Vishn\xcc\x81u is present in your weapons and in my body, so truly shall those\nweapons fail to harm me:" and accordingly, although struck heavily and\nrepeatedly by hundreds of the Daityas, the prince felt not the least pain, and\nhis strength was ever renewed. His father then endeavoured to persuade him to\nrefrain from glorifying his enemy, and promised him immunity if the would not\nbe so foolish as to persevere but Prahlada replied, that he felt no fear as\nlong as his immortal guardian against all dangers was present in his mind, the\nrecollection of whom was alone sufficient to dissipate all the perils\nconsequent upon birth or human infirmities.\n\nHiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu, highly exasperated, commanded the serpents to fall upon his\ndisobedient and insane son, and bite him to death with their envenomed fangs:\nand thereupon the great snakes Kuhaka, Takshaka,\n\np. 129\n\nand Andhaka, charged with fatal poison, bit the prince in every part of his\nbody; but he, with thoughts immovably fixed on Krishn\xcc\x81a, felt no pain from\ntheir wounds, being immersed in rapturous recollections of that divinity. Then\nthe snakes cried to the king, and said, "Our fangs are broken; our jewelled\ncrests are burst; there is fever in our, hoods, and fear in our hearts; but\nthe skin of the youth is still unscathed: have recourse, monarch of the\nDaityas, to some other expedient." "Ho, elephants of the skies!" exclaimed the\ndemon; "unite your tusks, and destroy this deserter from his father, and\nconspirer with my foes. It is thus that often our progeny are our destruction,\nas fire consumes the wood from which it springs." The young prince was then\nassailed by the elephants of the skies, as vast as mountain peaks; cast down\nupon the earth, and trampled on, and gored by their tusks: but he continued to\ncall to mind Govinda, and the tusks of the elephants were blunted against his\nbreast. "Behold," he said to his father, "the tusks of the elephants, as hard\nas adamant, are blunted; but this is not by any strength of mine: calling upon\nJanarddana is my defence against such fearful affliction."\n\nThen said the king to his attendants, "Dismiss the elephants, and let fire\nconsume him; and do thou, deity of the winds, blow up the fire, that this\nwicked wretch may be consumed." And the Danavas piled a mighty heap of wood\naround the prince, and kindled a fire, to burn him, as their master had\ncommanded. But Prahlada cried, "Father, this fire, though blown up by the\nwinds, burneth me not; and all around I behold the face of the skies, cool and\nfragrant, with beds of lotus flowers."\n\nThen the Brahmans who were the sons of Bhargava, illustrious priests, and\nreciters of the Sama-Veda, said to the king of the Daityas, "Sire, restrain\nyour wrath against your own son. How should anger succeed in finding a place\nin heavenly mansions? As for this lad, we will be his instructors, and teach\nhim obediently to labour for the destruction of your foes. Youth is the\nseason, king, of many errors; and you should not therefore be relentlessly\noffended with a child. If he will not listen to us, and abandon the cause of\nHari, we will adopt infallible measures to work his death." The king of the\nDaityas, thus solicited by the\n\np. 130\n\npriests, commanded the prince to be liberated from the midst of the flames.\n\nAgain established in the dwelling of his preceptor, Prahlada gave lessons\nhimself to the sons of the demons, in the intervals of his leisure. "Sons of\nthe offspring of Diti," he was accustomed to say to them, "hear from me the\nsupreme truth; nothing else is fit to be regarded; nothing, else here is an\nobject to be coveted. Birth, infancy, and youth are the portion of all\ncreatures; and then succeeds gradual and inevitable decay, terminating with\nall beings, children of the Daityas, in death: this is manifestly visible to\nall; to you as it is to me. That the dead are born again, and that it cannot\nbe otherwise, the sacred texts are warrant: but production cannot be without a\nmaterial cause; and as long as conception and parturition are the material\ncauses of repeated birth, so long, be sure, is pain inseparable from every\nperiod of existence. The simpleton, in his inexperience, fancies that the\nalleviation of hunger, thirst, cold, and the like is pleasure; but of a truth\nit is pain; for suffering gives delight to those whose vision is darkened by\ndelusion, as fatigue would be enjoyment to limbs that are incapable of motion\n3. This vile body is a compound of phlegm and other humours. Where are its\nbeauty, grace, fragrance, or other estimable qualities? The fool that is fond\nof a body composed of flesh, blood, matter, ordure, urine, membrane, marrow,\nand bones, will be enamoured of hell. The agreeableness of fire is caused by\ncold; of water, by thirst; of food, by hunger: by other circumstances their\ncontraries are equally agreeable 4. The child of the Daitya who\n\np. 131\n\ntakes to himself a wife introduces only so much misery into his bosom; for as\nmany as are the cherished affections of a living creature, so many are the\nthorns of anxiety implanted in his heart; and he who has large possessions in\nhis house is haunted, wherever he goes, with the apprehension that they may be\nlost or burnt or stolen. Thus there is great pain in being born: for the dying\nman there are the tortures of the judge of the deceased, and of passing again\ninto \'the womb. If you conclude that there is little enjoyment in the embryo\nstate, you must then admit that the world is made up of pain. Verily I say\nunto you, that in this ocean of the world, this sea of many sorrows, Vishn\xcc\x81u\nis your only hope. If ye say, you know nothing of this; \'we are children;\nembodied spirit in bodies is eternal; birth, youth, decay, are the properties\nof the body, not of the soul 5.\' But it is in this way that we deceive\nourselves. I am yet a child; but it is my purpose to exert myself when I am a\nyouth. I am yet a youth; but when I become old I will do what is needful for\nthe good of my soul. I am now old, and all my duties are to be fulfilled. How\nshall I, now that my faculties fail me, do what was left undone when my\nstrength was unimpaired?\' In this manner do men, whilst their minds are\ndistracted by sensual pleasures, ever propose, and never attain final\nbeatitude: they die thirsting 6. Devoted in childhood to play, and in youth to\npleasure, ignorant and impotent they find that old age is come upon them.\nTherefore even in childhood let the embodied soul acquire discriminative\nwisdom, and, independent\n\np. 132\n\nof the conditions of infancy, youth, or age, strive incessantly to be freed.\nThis, then, is what I declare unto you; and since you know that it is not\nuntrue, do you, out of regard to me, call to your minds Vishn\xcc\x81u, the liberator\nfrom all bondage. What difficulty is there in thinking upon him, who, when\nremembered, bestows prosperity; and by recalling whom to memory, day and\nnight, all sin is cleansed away? Let all your thoughts and affections be fixed\non him, who is present in all beings, and you shall laugh at every care. The\nwhole world is suffering under a triple affliction 7. \'What wise man would\nfeel hatred towards beings who are objects of compassion? If fortune be\npropitious to them, and I am unable to partake of the like enjoyments, yet\nwherefore should I cherish malignity towards those who are more prosperous\nthan myself: I should rather sympathise with their happiness; for the\nsuppression of malignant feelings is of itself a reward 8. If beings are\nhostile, and indulge in hatred, they are objects of pity to the wise, as\nencompassed by profound delusion. These are the reasons for repressing hate,\nwhich are adapted to the capacities of those who see the deity distinct from\nhis creatures. Hear, briefly, what influences those who have approached the\ntruth. This whole world is but a manifestation of Vishn\xcc\x81u, who is identical\nwith all things; and it is therefore to be regarded by the wise as not\ndiffering from, but as the same with themselves. Let us therefore lay aside\nthe angry passions of our race, and so strive that we obtain that perfect,\npure, and eternal happiness, which shall be beyond the power of the elements\nor their deities, of fire, of the sun, of the moon, of wind, of Indra, of the\nregent of the sea; which shall be unmolested by spirits of air or earth; by\nYakshas, Daityas, or their chiefs; by the serpent-gods or monstrous demigods\nof Swerga; which shall be uninterrupted by men or beasts, or\n\np. 133\n\nby the infirmities of human nature; by bodily sickness and disease 9, or\nhatred, envy, malice, passion, or desire; which nothing shall molest, and\nwhich every one who fixes his whole heart on Ke\xc5\x9bava shall enjoy. Verily I say\nunto you, that you shall have no satisfaction in various revolutions through\nthis treacherous world, but that you will obtain placidity for ever by\npropitiating Vishn\xcc\x81u, whose adoration is perfect calm. What here is difficult\nof attainment, when he is pleased? Wealth, pleasure, virtue, are things of\nlittle moment. Precious is the fruit that you shall gather, be assured, from\nthe exhaustless store of the tree of true wisdom."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[126:1](vp052.htm#fr_306) The boon, according to the Vayu Puran\xcc\x81a, was, that\nhe should not be slain by any created being: the Kurma adds, except by\nVishn\xcc\x81u. The Bhagavata has a similar boon as the Vayu, and therefore, says the\ncommentator, Vishn\xcc\x81u assumed the form of the Nrisinha, as being that of\nneither a man nor an animal.\n\n[127:2](vp052.htm#fr_307) The Puran\xcc\x81as teach constantly incompatible\ndoctrines. According to this passage, the Supreme Being is not the inert cause\nof creation only, but exercises the p. 128 functions of an active Providence.\nThe commentator quotes a text of the Veda in support of this view: \'Universal\nsoul entering into men, governs their conduct.\' Incongruities, however, are as\nfrequent in the Vedas as in the Puran\xcc\x81as; but apparently the most ancient\nparts of the Hindu ritual recognised an active ruler in the Creator of the\nuniverse; the notion of abstract deity originating with the schools of\nphilosophy.\n\n[130:3](vp052.htm#fr_308) This is the purport of the sentence apparently, and\nis that which the comment in part confirms. Literally it is, \'A blow is the\npleasure of those whose eyes are darkened by ignorance, whose limbs,\nexceedingly benumbed, desire pleasure by exercise: The commentator divides the\nsentence, however, and reads it, \'As fatigue would be like pleasure to\nparalyzed limbs; and a blow is enjoyment to those who are blinded by delusion;\nthat is, by love; for to them a slap, or even a kick, from a mistress would be\na favour.\' It is not improbably an allusion to some such venerable pastime as\nblindman\'s buff. This interpretation, however, leaves the construction of the\nfirst half of the sentence imperfect, unless the nominative and verb apply to\nboth portions.\n\n[130:4](vp052.htm#fr_309) They are so far from being sources of pleasure in\nthemselves, that, under different p. 131 contrasts, they become sources of\npain. Heat is agreeable in cold weather: cold is agreeable in hot weather;\nheat would then be disagreeable. Drink is pleasant to a thirsty man: thirst is\nagreeable to one who has drunk too much; and more drink would be painful. So\nof food, and of other contrasts.\n\n[131:5](vp052.htm#fr_310) \'Divine knowledge is the province only of those who\ncan separate soul from body; that is, who live independent of bodily\ninfirmities and passions. We have not overcome corporeal vicissitudes, and\nhave therefore no concern with such abstruse inquiries.\' This is the\ncommentator\'s explanation of the passage.\n\n[131:6](vp052.htm#fr_311) Alluding, says the commentator, to the fable of a\nwasherman, who, whilst washing his clothes in the Ganges, proposed daily to\ndrink of its waters, but forgot his purpose in his occupation: or of a boy,\nwho proposed the same as he pursued fish after fish, and never accomplished\nhis intention, being engrossed by his sport: both died without drinking.\n\n[132:7](vp052.htm#fr_312) The three kinds of affliction of the Sankhya\nphilosophy: internal, as bodily or mental distress; external, as injuries from\nmen, animals, &c.; and superhuman, or inflictions by gods or demons. See S.\nKarika, ver. 1.\n\n[132:8](vp052.htm#fr_313) The construction of the text is elliptical and\nbrief, but the sense is sufficiently clear. The order of the last pada is thus\ntransposed by the commentator: \'Whence (from feeling pleasure) the abandonment\nof enmity is verily the consequence.\'\n\n[133:9](vp052.htm#fr_314) The original rather unpoetically specifies some of\nthese, or fever, ophthalmia, dysentery, spleen, liver, &c. The whole of these\ndefects are the individuals of the three species of pain alluded to before.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVIII](vp053.htm)\n\n'
