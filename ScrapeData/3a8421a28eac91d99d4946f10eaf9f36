The Ordeal by Balance.\n\n* 260. 260 Wise legislators conversant with every law have proclaimed, after mature consideration, the following rules regarding the mode of performing the ordeal by balance, which may be administered in every season.\n\n* 261. 261 The two posts should be dug in every\n\np. 103\n\ncase to the depth of two Hastas below ground. (The whole of) their length is\nordained to amount to six Hastas in extent.\n\n* 262. The beam of the balance should be four Hastas in length, and the height of the two posts (above ground) should be the same. The intermediate space between the two posts should measure one and a half Hastas.\n\n* 263. 263 The beam of the balance should be made straight, of Khadira or of Tinduka wood, quadrangular and (provided) with three Sthanas and with hooks (by which the strings supporting the scale are suspended) and with other (contrivances).\n\n* 264. 264 He should cause it to be made of Khadira wood or _S_ i _m_ sapa wood, or in default of such, of\n\np. 104\n\n[paragraph continues] _S_ ala wood, (which must be) without notches and\nwithered portions, and devoid of rents.\n\n* 265. 265 These kinds of timber should be used for preparing the beam of the balance, (which should be erected) either in the midst of a public assembly, or before the gates of the royal palace, or in sight of a temple, or in a cross-road.\n\n266. 266 (The balance) must be dug firmly into the earth, after having been covered with perfumes, garlands, and unguents, and after the performance of purificatory and auspicious ceremonies with sour milk, whole grain, clarified butter, and perfumes.\n\n267. 267 This ordeal should always be administered in the presence of the guardians of the world, who must be invoked to be present for the protection (of virtue and justice), and in sight of everybody (who cares to look on).\n\n* 268. 268 It is ordained that all ordeals should be\n\np. 105\n\nadministered in the forenoon, the person (to be tested) having fasted for a\nday and a night, taken a bath, and wearing his wet dress.\n\n269\\. Excepting cases of high treason, an ordeal shall not be administered,\nunless the plaintiff comes forward and declares himself ready to undergo\npunishment in case of his being defeated.\n\n270\\. The king may inflict ordeals on his own servants, even without the one\nparty declaring himself ready to undergo punishment. On the other hand, in the\ncase of other persons accused of a crime, (he should administer ordeals)\naccording to law (only).\n\n* 271. 271 After having well fastened the two scales by the hooks of the beam, he should place the man in the one scale and a stone in the other.\n\np. 106\n\n* 272. He should weigh the man on the northern side, and the stone on the southern side. There (in the southern scale) he should (place) a basket and fill it up with bricks, mud, and grains of sand.\n\n273. 273 In the first weighing, the weight (of the man) should be ascertained with the aid of experienced men, and the arch marked at that height which corresponds to the even position of the two scales.\n\n* 274. Goldsmiths, merchants, and skilful braziers experienced in the art of weighing, should inspect the beam of the balance.\n\n* 275. After having first weighed the man, and having made (on the arches) a mark for the beam, in order to show the (even) position of the scales, he should cause him to descend from the balance.\n\n* 276. 276 After having admonished him with solemn imprecations he should cause the man to get into the scale again, after having fastened a writing on\n\np. 107\n\nhis head. There must be neither wind nor rainfall (at the time when this\nordeal is being performed).\n\n277. 277 When he has ascended (the scale), a Brahman, holding the scale in his hand, should recite the following: 'Thou art called dha _t_ a (a balance), which appellation is synonymous with dharma (justice).\n\n* 278. Thou knowest the bad and good actions of all beings. This man, being arraigned in a cause, is weighed upon thee.\n\n279. 279 Thou art superior to gods, demons, and mortals in point of veracity.\n\n[Thou, Balance, hast been created by the gods in time out of mind, as a\nreceptacle of truth.\n\n* 280. Deign to speak truth, therefore, O propitious being, and deliver me from this perplexity. If I am an offender, take me down.\n\n* 281. If thou knowest me to be innocent, take me upwards.] Therefore mayst thou deliver him lawfully from the perplexity in which he is involved.'\n\n282\\. After having addressed him, (invoking) the guardians of the world and\nthe gods, with these and other such speeches, he should cause the man who has\nbeen placed in the scale, to descend once more and should ascertain (the state\nof the matter).\n\n* 283. If he rises, on being weighed (for the second time), he is undoubtedly innocent. If his\n\np. 108\n\nweight remains the same as before, or if he goes down, he cannot be acquitted.\n\n* 284. 284 Should the scales break, or the beam or the hooks split, or the strings burst, or the transverse beam split, (the judge) shall pronounce a formal declaration of his innocence.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[102:260](sbe3327.htm#fr_303) 260-284. Vish _n_ u X; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II,\n100-102.\n\n260\\. 'After mature consideration,' after having duly considered that the\nordeals by fire, water, and poison are subject to many interruptions or\nobstacles arising from time, locality, &c., wise men have devised this ordeal\nby balance, which may be performed during any season. That is the meaning. A.\n\n[102:261](sbe3327.htm#fr_304) The apparatus for performing the ordeal by\nbalance, which is described in this and the following paragraphs, consists of\nthe p. 103 following elements: 1. Two wooden posts, supporting a transverse\nbeam. The two posts should be fastened in the ground at a distance of one-and-\na-half Hastas (1 Hasta = about 18 inches), facing the west and east. The part\nabove ground should be four Hastas long, and the part below ground two Hastas,\nthe whole length of each post amounting to six Hastas. 2. The beam of the\nbalance, by which the scales have to be suspended. The beam itself, which\nshould measure four Hastas, and should be made of Khadira or other strong\nwood, should be suspended by means of an iron hook and chain in the middle of\nthe transverse beam. 3. The beam of the balance should be surrounded in the\nmiddle and at the two extremities, by three Sthanas (belts?) by which two iron\nhooks should be fastened. 4. The two scales should be suspended at the two\nends of the beam, by the iron hooks, and by four strings each. 5. Each of the\ntwo scales should move in a wooden arch (tora _n_ a), which serves the purpose\nof marking the position of the scales. See Mitakshara and Stenzler's paper on\nOrdeals (vol. ix of the Journal of the German Oriental Society), to which a\ndrawing has been added for the purpose of illustrating the statements of the\nSm _ri_ ti writers regarding this kind of ordeal.\n\n[103:263](sbe3327.htm#fr_305) Read _ri_ _g_ vi in the text.\n\n[103:264](sbe3327.htm#fr_306) Wood of the Khadira tree is the most eligible\nsort of wood. Then comes Tinduka wood, and lastly _S_ i _m_ sapa wood. A.\n\n[104:265](sbe3327.htm#fr_307) The various places here mentioned are the\nfavourite abodes of Dharmara _g_ a (the king of justice), when he appears on\nearth. A. The Viramitrodaya and other compositions quote two verses of\nKatyayana, to the effect that ordeals should be administered to felons in\nsight of a temple; to those who have offended against the king, before the\ngates of his palace; to low-caste persons, in a cross-road; and to other\noffenders, in the midst of a public assembly, or court of justice.\n\n[104:266](sbe3327.htm#fr_308) It appears from the statements of other\nlegislators, that the ceremonies to be performed on this occasion are\nperfectly analogous to those which have to take place on the occasion of\npreparing a sacrificial stake (yupa).\n\n[104:267](sbe3327.htm#fr_309) 'In sight of everybody,' not in a solitary spot.\nA.\n\n[104:268](sbe3327.htm#fr_310) 268-270. This is a digression relative to\ncertain exceptions to the rule in pars. 257, 258. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 96,\n99; Vish _n_ u IX, 22.\n\n268\\. An ordeal is ordained, when the plaintiff declares himself ready to\nundergo punishment. Where, however, any outrage has been committed against the\nroyal family, an ordeal should be administered even without a declaration of\nthis sort. A.\n\n[105:271](sbe3327.htm#fr_311) The essential features of the proceedings\ndescribed in pars. 271-284 may be summarized as follows: 1. The person to be\ntested by this ordeal should be placed in the one scale, and a basket filled\nwith stones and sand placed in the other scale, as an equivalent. 2. The\nbasket having been made precisely equal in weight to the man with the help of\ngoldsmiths and other persons skilled in the practice of weighing, the position\nof the beam should be marked on each of the two arches. 3. After that, the man\nshould be allowed to descend from the scale. The judge should admonish him,\nand he should get into the scale again, after a bill recounting the charge\nraised against him has been fastened on his head. 4. A Brahman should address\nthe balance with prayers. 5. The man having descended once more from the\nscale, the result of the second weighing should be compared with the result of\nthe first weighing. If he has risen, i.e. if he has proved lighter than the\nfirst time, he shall be acquitted; if the scale has gone down, or if it has\nremained in the same place as before, he must be pronounced guilty. 6. If any\npart of the balance has broken during the proceeding, he has to be acquitted.\n\n271\\. The term 'a stone' seems to denote an equivalent here and in the next\nparagraph. The sequel shows that the equivalent consists of a basket filled\nwith stones and other objects.\n\n[106:273](sbe3327.htm#fr_312) 273-275. Goldsmiths, merchants, braziers, and\nother persons familiar with the art of weighing, should ascertain whether the\nman and the equivalent are precisely equal in weight, and whether the beam of\nthe balance is quite straight, by pouring some water (on the beam of the\nbalance?). A. According to the Pitamaha-sm _ri_ ti, the water shall be poured\non the beam of the balance. If it does not trickle down from the beam, the\nbeam may be supposed to be straight. The way in which the position of the\nscales and of the beam of the balance has to be marked on the two arches, may\nbe gathered from the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya-sm _ri_ ti, which ordains that a line\nshall be drawn (across the arches).\n\n[106:276](sbe3327.htm#fr_313) He should cause the man to get into the scale\nonce more, after having reminded him of his good actions and of the\npreeminence of truth, having invoked the deities, and having fastened on his\nhead a bill recounting the charge, and containing an imprecation. The whole\nproceeding must not take place in windy or rainy weather. A. The Viramitrodaya\nand other compilations quote another text of Narada, according to which no\nverdict should be given if the scales have been moved by the wind.\n\n[107:277](sbe3327.htm#fr_314) This quibble is based on the fact that the two\nwords Dha _t_ a and Dharma commence with the same syllable.\n\n[107:279](sbe3327.htm#fr_315) 279-281. The words enclosed in brackets cannot\nbe genuine. They appear to be a quotation from the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya-sm _ri_\nti (II, 101, 102), which has been added as a marginal gloss by a copyist, and\nhas subsequently crept into the text. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya puts this entire\naddress in the mouth of the defendant himself, whereas all the other _S_ m\n_ri_ ti writers put it in the mouth of a third person.\n\n[108:284](sbe3327.htm#fr_316) It seems strange that the accidents mentioned in\nthis paragraph should be viewed as proofs of innocence. Vish _n_ u, Katyayana,\nand Vyasa rule that the proceeding shall be repeated in every such case. B\n_ri_ haspati says that these accidents shall be taken as proofs of guilt. The\nreading murtita _h_ may be wrong (for puna _h_ sa? 'he shall cause the\nproceeding to be repeated'). See Vyasa.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 21. The Ordeal by Fire](sbe3328.htm)\n\n"
