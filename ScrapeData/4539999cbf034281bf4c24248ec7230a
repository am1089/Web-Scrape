(The small ether is Brahman) on account of\n\np. 180\n\nthe action of going (into Brahman) and of the word (brahmaloka); for thus it\nis seen (i. e. that the individual souls go into Brahman is seen elsewhere in\nScripture); and (this going of the souls into Brahman constitutes) an\ninferential sign (by means of which we may properly interpret the word\n'brahmaloka').\n\nIt has been declared (in the preceding Sutra) that the small (ether) is the\nhighest Lord, on account of the reasons contained in the subsequent passages.\nThese subsequent reasons are now set forth.--For this reason also the small\n(ether) can be the highest Lord only, because the passage complementary to the\npassage concerning the small (ether) contains a mention of going and a word,\nboth of which intimate the highest Lord. In the first place, we read ( _Kh_.\nUp. VIII, 3, 2), 'All these creatures, day after day going into that Brahma-\nworld, do not discover it.' This passage which refers back, by means of the\nword 'Brahma-world,' to the small ether which forms the general subject-\nmatter, speaks of the going to it of the creatures, i. e. the individual\nsouls, wherefrom we conclude that the small (ether) is Brahman. For this going\nof the individual souls into Brahman, which takes place day after day in the\nstate of deep sleep, is seen, i.e. is met with in another scriptural passage,\nviz. _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 1, 'He becomes united with the True,' &c. In ordinary\nlife also we say of a man who lies in deep sleep, 'he has become Brahman,' 'he\nis gone into the state of Brahman.'--In the second place, the word 'Brahma-\nworld,' which is here applied to the small (ether) under discussion, excludes\nall thought of the individual soul or the elemental ether, and thus gives us\nto understand that the small (ether) is Brahman.--But could not the word\n'Brahma-world' convey as well the idea of the world of him whose throne is the\nlotus  1?--It might do so indeed, if we explained the compound 'Brahma-world'\nas 'the world of Brahman.' But if we explain it on the ground of the\ncoordination of both members of the compound--so that\n\np. 181\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Brahma-world' denotes that world which is Brahman--then\nit conveys the idea of the highest Brahman only.--And that daily going (of the\nsouls) into Brahman (mentioned above) is, moreover, an inferential sign for\nexplaining the compound 'Brahma-world,' on the ground of the co-ordination of\nits two constituent members. For it would be impossible to assume that all\nthose creatures daily go into the world of the effected (lower) Brahman; which\nworld is commonly called the Satyaloka, i. e. the world of the True.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[180:1](sbe34084.htm#fr_189) I. e.
