On the other hand, as (those qualities) are not possible (in it), the\nembodied (soul is) not (denoted by manomaya, &c.).\n\nThe preceding Sutra has declared that the qualities mentioned are possible in\nBrahman; the present Sutra states that they are not possible in the embodied\nSelf. Brahman only possesses, in the manner explained, the qualities of\nconsisting of mind, and so on; not the embodied individual soul. For qualities\nsuch as expressed in the words, 'He whose purposes are true, whose Self is the\nether, who has no speech, who is not disturbed, who is greater than the\nearth,' cannot easily be attributed to the embodied Self. By the term\n'embodied' ( _s_ arira) we have to understand 'residing' in a body. If it be\nobjected that the Lord also resides in the body 1, we reply, True, he does\nreside in the body, but not in the body only; for _s_ ruti declares him to be\nall-pervading; compare, 'He is greater than the earth; greater than the\natmosphere, omnipresent like the ether, eternal.' The individual soul, on the\nother\n\np. 112\n\nhand, is in the body only, apart from which as the abode of fruition it does\nnot exist.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[111:1](sbe34040.htm#fr_143) Because he is vyapin.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 4](sbe34041.htm)\n\n"
