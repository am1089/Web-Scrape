Now then [1], (on the day) after the impurity is over, let him bathe duly\n(during the recitation of Mantras), wash his hands and feet duly, and sip\nwater duly, (and having invited some Brahma _n_ as), as many as possible, who\nmust cleanse themselves in the same way and turn their faces towards the\nnorth, let him bestow presents of perfumes, garlands, clothes and other things\n(a lamp, frankincense, and the like) upon them, and hospitably entertain them.\n\n2\\. At the Ekoddish _t_ a (or _S_ raddha for one recently deceased) let him\nalter the Mantras[1] so as to refer to (the) one person (deceased)[2].\n\n[XXI. 1-11. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. IV, 7; Par. III, 10, 48-53; _S_ a _n_ kh. IV, 2; M. III,\n247; Y. III, 250, 251, 255.--12-23. _S_ a _n_ kh. IV, 3; V, 9; Y. I, 252-254.\nRegarding the parallel passages of the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra, see the\nIntroduction.\n\n1\\. 1 \'Having said, in the previous Chapter (XX, 30), that "the obsequies\nshould be performed," he now goes on to describe that part of the obsequies\nwhich has not yet been expounded, viz. the "first _S_ raddha."\' (Nand.)\n\n2\\. 1 The Mantras here referred to are those contained in the description of\nthe Parva _n_ a and other ordinary _S_ raddhas in Chapter LXXIII. Thus, the\nMantra, \'This is your (share), ye manes\' (LXXIII, 12, 13), has to be altered\ninto, \'This is thy (share), father;\' and so on. Devapala, in his Commentary on\nthe Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra, gives an accurate statement of all the\nmodifications which the ordinary Mantras have to undergo at the Ekoddish _t_\na.-- 2 Nand. states that not only the Mantras, but the whole ritual should be\nmodified. The nature of the latter modifications is stated by Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya\nloc. cit. and by Sa _n_ khayana loc. cit.]\n\np. 84\n\n3\\. Close to the food left (by the Brahma _n_ as) let him offer a ball of\nrice, at the same time calling out his name and (that of) his race.\n\n4\\. The Brahma _n_ as having taken food and having been honoured with a gift,\nlet him offer, as imperishable food, water to the Brahma _n_ as, after having\ncalled out the name and Gotra of the deceased; and let him dig three trenches,\neach four A _n_ gulas in breadth, their distance from one another and their\ndepth also measuring (four A _n_ gulas), and their length amounting to one\nVitasti (or twelve A _n_ gulas).\n\n5\\. Close by the trenches let him light three fires, and having added fuel to\nthem, let him make three oblations (of boiled rice) in each (fire, saying),\n\n6\\. \'Svadha and reverence to Soma, accompanied by the manes.\n\n7\\. \'Svadha and reverence to Agni, who conveys the oblations addressed to the\nmanes.\n\n8\\. \'Svadha and reverence to Yama A _n_ giras.\'\n\n9\\. Then let him offer balls of rice as (ordained) before (in Sutra 3) on the\nthree mounds of earth (adjacent to the three trenches).\n\n10\\. After having filled the three trenches with\n\n[3. This must be done with the Mantra, \'This is for you.\' (Nand.) Regarding\nthis Mantra, see note on Sutra 10.\n\n4\\. The \'imperishable water,\' akshayyodakam, derives its name from the Mantra,\nwith which it is delivered, expressing the wish that the meal \'may give\nimperishable satisfaction\' (akshayyam astu). This is the explanation which\nNand. gives of the term akshayyodakam in his gloss on LXXIII, 27. In his\ncomment on the present Sutra he says that the \'imperishable water\' must be\npresented with the (further?) Mantras, \'Let arrive\' and \'Be satisfied.\' See Y.\nI, 251 Sa _n_ kh. IV, 2, 6.\n\n10\\. The whole Mantra runs as follows, \'This is for you, father, __________\n\n{footnote p. 85 and for those after you.\' But in the present case (at a \'first\nSr addha\') the name of the deceased has to be substituted for the word\n\'father.\' (Nand.) Although Nand. quotes this Mantra from \xc3\x82svalayana\'s Srauta-\nsutra, it seems probable that the author of the Vishnu-sutra took it from the\nKathaka (IX, 6 of the Berlin MS.)] {p. 85}\n\nrice, sour milk, clarified butter, honey, and meat, let him mutter (the\nMantra), \'This is for you.\'\n\n11\\. This ceremony he must repeat monthly, on the day of his death.\n\n12\\. At the close of the year let him give food to the Brahma _n_ as, after\nhaving fed the gods first, in honour of the deceased and of his father,\ngrandfather, and great-grandfather.\n\n13\\. At (the Ekoddish _t_ a belonging to) this ceremony let him perform the\nburnt-offering, the invitation, and (the offering of) water for washing the\nfeet.\n\n14\\. Then he must pour the water for washing the feet and the Arghya (water\nlibation) destined for the deceased person into the three vessels containing\nthe water for washing the feet, and the three other vessels containing the\nArghya of his three ancestors. At the same time he must mutter\n\n[11. The Sutras following next refer to the Sapi _nd_ ikara _n_ a or \'ceremony\nof investing a dead person with the rights of a Sapinda.\'\n\n12\\. \'He must invite six Brahma _n_ as altogether, four as representatives of\nthe deceased person and of his three ancestors, two for the offering to be\naddressed to the Vi _s_ vedevas. The Brahma _n_ a, who represents the deceased\nperson, must be fed according to the rule of the Ekoddish _t_ a, and the three\nBrahmanas, who represent the three ancestors, must be fed according to the\nrule of the Parva _n_ a _S_ raddha, as laid down in Chapter LXXXIII.\' (Nand.)\n\n13\\. The import of this Sutra is, that those three ceremonies must not be\nomitted in the present case, as is otherwise the case at an Ekoddish _t_ a.\n(Nand.)\n\n14\\. 1 The following is a translation of the whole of this Mantra, {footnote\np. 85} which is quoted at full in the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra, \'May P\n_ri_ thivi (the earth), Vayu (air), Agni (fire), and Pra _g_ apati (the lord\nof creatures) unite thee with thy ancestors, and way you ancestors unite with\nhim.\' Regarding the particular ancestors implied here, see below, LXXV.--2\nRig-veda X, 191, 4.]\n\np. 86\n\n(the two Mantras), \'May earth unite thee [1],\' and \'United your minds[2].\'\n\n15\\. Near the leavings he must make (and put) four balls of rice.\n\n16\\. Let him show out the Brahma _n_ as, after they have sipped water duly and\nhave been presented by him with their sacrificial fee.\n\n17\\. Then let him knead together the ball of the deceased person with the\nthree balls (of the three ancestors), as (he has mixed up) his water for\nwashing the feet and his Arghya (with theirs).\n\n18\\. Let him do the same (with the balls placed) near the three trenches.\n\n19\\. Or (see Sutra 12) the Sapi _nd_ ikara _n_ a must be performed on the\nthirteenth, after the monthly _S_ raddha has been performed on the twelfth[1]\nday.\n\n20\\. For _S_ udras it should be performed on the twelfth day, without Mantras.\n\n21\\. If there be an intercalary month in that year, he must add one day to the\n(regular days of the) monthly _S_ raddha.\n\n22\\. The ceremony of investing women with the relationship of Sapi _nd_ a has\nto be performed in the same manner. Later, he must perform a _S_ raddha every\nyear, while he lives, (on the anniversary of the deceased relative\'s\ndeath)[1].\n\n[19. 1 I.e. on that day on which the period of impurity expires. (Nand.)\n\n22\\. 1 The meaning is, that he must give him food and water, as prescribed in\n23. (Nand.)]\n\np. 87\n\n23\\. He, for whom the ceremony of investing him with the, relationship of Sapi\n_nd_ a is performed after the lapse of a year, shall be honoured by the gift,\n(on each day) of that year, of food and a jar with water to a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXII.](sbe07024.htm)\n\n'
