Prayer to Varuna for protection against treacherous designs.\n\n1\\. The great guardian among these (gods) sees as if from anear. He that\nthinketh he is moving stealthily--all this the gods know.  \n2\\. If a man stands, walks, or sneaks about, if he goes slinking away, if he\ngoes into his hiding-place; if two persons sit together and scheme, king\nVaruna is there as a third, and knows it.  \n3\\. Both this earth here belongs to king Varuna, and also yonder broad sky\nwhose boundaries are far away. Moreover these two oceans are the loins of\nVaruna; yea, he is hidden in this small (drop of) water.  \n4\\. He that should flee beyond the heaven far away would not be free from king\nVaruna. His spies come hither (to the earth) from heaven, with a thousand eyes\ndo they watch over the earth.  \n5\\. King Varuna sees through all that is between heaven and earth, and all\nthat is beyond. He has counted the winkings of men's eyes. As a (winning)\ngamester puts down his dice, thus does he establish these (laws).  \n6\\. May all thy fateful toils which, seven by seven, threefold, lie spread\nout, ensnare him that speaks falsehood: him that speaks the truth they shall\nlet go!  \n7\\. With a hundred snares, O Varuna, surround him, let the liar not go free\nfrom thee, O thou that observest men! The rogue shall sit, his belly hanging\nloose, like a cask without hoops, bursting all about!  \n8\\. With (the snare of) Varuna which is fastened lengthwise, and that which\n(is fastened) broadwise, with the indigenous and the foreign, with the divine\nand the human,--  \n9\\. With all these snares do I fetter thee, O N. N., descended from N. N., the\nson of the woman N. N.: all these do I design for thee.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 12.
