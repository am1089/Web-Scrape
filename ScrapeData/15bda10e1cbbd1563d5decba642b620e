And likewise (there results from the _G_ aina, doctrine) non-universality\nof the Self.\n\nWe have hitherto urged against the _G_ aina doctrine an objection resulting\nfrom the syadvada, viz. that one thing cannot have contradictory attributes.\nWe now turn to the objection that from their doctrine it would follow that the\nindividual Self is not universal, i.e. not omnipresent.--The _G_ ainas are of\nopinion that the soul has the same size as the body. From this it would follow\nthat the soul is not of infinite extension, but limited, and hence non-eternal\nlike jars and similar things. Further, as the bodies of different classes of\ncreatures are of different size, it might happen that the soul of a man--which\nis of the size of the human body--when entering, in consequence of its former\ndeeds, on a new state of existence in the body of an elephant would not be\nable to fill the whole of it; or else that a human soul being relegated to the\nbody of an ant would not be able to find sufficient room in it. The same\ndifficulty would, moreover, arise with regard to the successive stages of one\nstate of existence, infancy, youth, and old age.--But why, the _G_ aina may\nask, should we not look upon the soul as consisting of an infinite number of\nparts capable of undergoing compression in a small body and dilatation in a\nbig one?--Do you, we ask in return, admit or not admit that those countless\nparticles of the soul may occupy the same place or not?--If you do not admit\nit, it follows that the infinite number of particles cannot be contained in a\nbody of limited dimensions.--If you do admit it, it follows that, as then the\nspace occupied by all the particles may be the space of one particle only, the\nextension of all the particles together will remain inconsiderable, and hence\nthe soul be of minute size (not of the size of the body). You have, moreover,\nno right to assume that a body\n\np. 432\n\nof limited size contains an infinite number of soul particles.\n\nWell the, the _G_ aina may reply, let us assume that by turns whenever the\nsoul enters a big body some particles accede to it while some withdraw from it\nwhenever it enters a small body.--To this hypothesis the next Sutra furnishes\na reply.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 35](sbe34211.htm)\n\n'
