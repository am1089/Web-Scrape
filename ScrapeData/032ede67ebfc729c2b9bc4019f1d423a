If it be said that from the circumstance of (the objects of enjoyment)\npassing over into the enjoyer (and vice versa) there would result non-\ndistinction (of the two); we reply that (such distinction) may exist\n(nevertheless), as ordinary experience shows.\n\nAnother objection, based on reasoning, is raised against the doctrine of\nBrahman being the cause of the world.--Although Scripture is authoritative\nwith regard to its own special subject-matter (as, for instance, the causality\nof Brahman), still it may have to be taken in a secondary sense in those cases\nwhere the subject-matter is taken out of its grasp by other means of right\nknowledge; just as mantras and arthavadas have occasionally to be explained in\na secondary sense (when the primary, literal sense is rendered impossible by\nother means of right knowledge 1). Analogously reasoning is to be considered\ninvalid outside its legitimate sphere; so, for instance, in the case of\nreligious duty and its opposite 2.--Hence Scripture cannot be acknowledged to\nrefute what is settled by other means of right knowledge. And if you ask,\n'Where does Scripture oppose itself to what is thus established?' we give you\nthe following\n\np. 319\n\ninstance. The distinction of enjoyers and objects of enjoyment is well known\nfrom ordinary experience, the enjoyers being intelligent, embodied souls,\nwhile sound and the like are the objects of enjoyment. Devadatta, for\ninstance, is an enjoyer, the dish (which he eats) an object of enjoyment. The\ndistinction of the two would be reduced to non-existence if the enjoyer passed\nover into the object of enjoyment, and vice versa. Now this passing over of\none thing into another would actually result from the doctrine of the world\nbeing non-different from Brahman. But the sublation of a well-established\ndistinction is objectionable, not only with regard to the present time when\nthat distinction is observed to exist, but also with regard to the past and\nthe future, for which it is inferred. The doctrine of Brahman's causality must\ntherefore be abandoned, as it would lead to the sublation of the well-\nestablished distinction of enjoyers and objects of enjoyment.\n\nTo the preceding objection we reply, 'It may exist as in ordinary experience.'\nEven on our philosophic view the distinction may exist, as ordinary experience\nfurnishes us with analogous instances. We see, for instance, that waves, foam,\nbubbles, and other modifications of the sea, although they really are not\ndifferent from the sea-water, exist, sometimes in the state of mutual\nseparation, sometimes in the state of conjunction, &c. From the fact of their\nbeing non-different from the sea-water, it does not follow that they pass over\ninto each other; and, again, although they do not pass over into each other,\nstill they are not different from the sea. So it is in the case under\ndiscussion also. The enjoyers and the objects of enjoyment do not pass over\ninto each other, and yet they are not different from the highest Brahman. And\nalthough the enjoyer is not really an effect of Brahman, since the unmodified\ncreator himself, in so far as he enters into the effect, is called the enjoyer\n(according to the passage, 'Having created he entered into it,' Taitt. Up. II,\n6), still after Brahman has entered into its effects it passes into a state of\ndistinction, in consequence of the effect acting as a limiting adjunct; just\nas the universal ether is divided by its contact with jars and other limiting\n\np. 320\n\nadjuncts. The conclusion is, that the distinction of enjoyers and objects of\nenjoyment is possible, although both are non-different from Brahman, their\nhighest cause, as the analogous instance of the sea and its waves\ndemonstrates.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[318:1](sbe34152.htm#fr_280) The following arthavada-passage, for instance,\n'the sacrificial post is the sun,' is to be taken in a metaphorical sense;\nbecause perception renders it impossible for us to take it in its literal\nmeaning.\n\n[318:2](sbe34152.htm#fr_281) Which are to be known from the Veda only.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 14](sbe34153.htm)\n\n"
