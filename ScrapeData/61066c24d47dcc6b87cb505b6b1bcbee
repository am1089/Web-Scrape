Prayer for success at dice.\n\n1\\. As the lightning at all times smites irresistibly the tree, thus would I\nto-day irresistibly beat the gamesters with my dice!  \n2\\. Whether they be alert, or not alert, the fortune of (these) folks,\nunresisting, shall assemble from all sides, the gain (collect) within my\nhands!  \n3\\. I invoke with reverence Agni, who has his own riches; here attached he\nshall beap up gain for us! I procure (wealth) for myself, as if with chariots\nthat win the race. May I accomplish auspiciously the song of praise to the\nMaruts!  \n4\\. May we by thy aid conquer the (adversary s) troop; help us (to obtain) our\nshare in every contest! Make for us, O Indra, a good and ample road; crush, O\nMaghavan, the lusty power of our enemies!  \n5\\. I have conquered and cleaned thee out (?); I have also gained thy reserve.\nAs the wolf plucks to pieces the sheep, thus do I pluck thy winnings.  \n6\\. Even the strong hand the bold player conquers, as the skilled gambler\nheaps up his winnings at the proper time. Upon him that loves the game (the\ngod), and does not spare his money, (the game, the god) verily bestows the\ndelights of wealth.  \n7\\. Through (the possession of) cattle we all would suppress (our) wretched\npoverty, or with grain our hunger, O thou oft implored (god)! May we foremost\namong rulers, unharmed, gain wealth by our cunning devices!  \n8\\. Gain is deposited in my right hand, victory in my left. Let me become a\nconqueror of cattle, horses, wealth, and gold!  \n9\\. O dice, yield play, profitable as a cow that is rich in milk! Bind me to a\nstreak of gain, as the bow (is bound) with the string!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 56. Exorcism of serpents from the premises](av180.htm)\n\n'
