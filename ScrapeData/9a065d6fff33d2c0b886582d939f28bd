If it be said that (Brahman is) not (recognised) on account of the\ndifference of designation; (we say) not so, on account of there being no\ncontradiction in either (designation).\n\nIn the former passage, 'three feet of it are what is immortal in heaven,'\nheaven is referred to as the abode of the being under discussion; while in the\nlatter passage, 'that light which shines above this heaven,' heaven is\nmentioned as marking its boundary. Owing to this discrepancy, the Brahman\nreferred to in the former text is not recognised in the latter.--This\nobjection the Sutra disposes of by pointing out that owing to the essential\nagreement of the two statements, nothing stands in the way of the required\nrecognition. When we say, 'The hawk is on the top of the tree,' and 'the hawk\nis above the top of the tree,' we mean one and the same thing.--The 'light,'\ntherefore, is nothing else but the most glorious and luminous highest Person.\nHim who in the former passage is called four-footed, we know to have an\nextraordinarily beautiful shape and colour-(cp., e.g., 'I know that great\nPerson of sunlike colour beyond the darkness' ( _S_ vet.Up. III, 9)--, and as\nhence his brilliancy also must be extraordinary, he is, in the text under\ndiscussion, quite appropriately called 'light.'--Here terminates the adhikara\n_n_ a of 'light.'\n\nIt has been shown that the being endowed with supreme brilliance, called\n'Light,' which the text mentions as something well known, is the highest\nPerson. The Sutrakara will now show that the being designated as Indra and\n\np. 250\n\n[paragraph continues] Pra _n_ a, which the text enjoins as an object of\nmeditation, for the reason that it is the means for attaining immortality--a\npower which is inseparable from causal power--, is likewise the highest\nPerson.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 29.
