The Sacrifice is the Year; and, verily, sacrifice is offered at\nthe end of the year of him whoso knows that the sacrifice is the year; and all\nthat is done in the year comes to be gained, secured, and won for him.\n\n11:2:7:22\\. The officiating priests are the seasons; and, verily, sacrifice is\noffered at the end of the seasons of him whoso knows that the officiating\npriests are the seasons; and all that is done in the seasons comes to be\ngained, secured, and won for him.\n\n11:2:7:33\\. The oblations are the months; and, verily, sacrifice is offered at\nthe end of the months of him whoso knows that the oblations are the months;\n\np. 39\n\nand all that is done in the months comes to be gained, secured, and won for\nhim.\n\n11:2:7:44\\. The oblation-vessels are the half-months; and, verily, sacrifice\nis offered at the end of the half-months of him whoso knows that the oblation-\nvessels are the half-months; and all that is done in the half-months comes to\nbe gained, secured, and won for him.\n\n11:2:7:55\\. The two attendants 1 are the day and night; and, verily, sacrifice\nis offered at the end of the day and night of him whoso knows that the two\nattendants are the day and night; and all that is done in the day and night\ncomes to be gained, secured, and won for him.\n\n11:2:7:66\\. The first kindling-verse is this (earth), the second the fire, the\nthird the wind, the fourth the air, the fifth the sky, the sixth the sun, the\nseventh the moon, the eighth the mind, the ninth speech, the tenth fervid\ndevotion, and the eleventh the Brahman; for it is these that kindle all this\n(universe), and by them all this (universe) is kindled, whence they are called\nkindling-verses.\n\n11:2:7:77\\. Thrice he recites the first (kindling-verse): by reciting it the\nfirst time he gains the eastern region, by the second time he gains the\nsouthern region, and by the third time he gains the upper region.\n\n11:2:7:88\\. And thrice he recites the last (verse): by reciting it the first\ntime he gains the western region, by the second time he gains the northern\nregion, by the third time he gains this same (earth as a) resting-place;\n\np. 40\n\nand by those (kindling-verses) he thus gains these worlds, and these regions.\n\n11:2:7:99\\. The first libation of ghee is the sacred law, and the second the\ntruth; and, verily, he secures for himself law and truth, and whatsoever is to\nbe gained by law and truth all that he now gains.\n\n11:2:7:1010\\. The first fore-offering is brilliance, the second honour, the\nthird fame, the fourth holy lustre, the fifth food (prosperity).\n\n11:2:7:1111\\. After the first fore-offering let him utter (the anumantra _n_ a\n1), 'May I become brilliant;' after the second, 'May I become honoured; after\nthe third, 'May I become glorious;' after the fourth, 'May I become endowed\nwith holy lustre;' after the fifth, 'May I become prosperous;'--and, verily,\nwhosoever knows this becomes brilliant, and honoured, and glorious, and\nendowed with holy lustre, and prosperous.\n\n11:2:7:1212\\. Now, _S_ vetaketu \xc3\x82ru _n_ eya 2, who knew this, said once, 'To\nhim who will thus know that glory of the fore-offerings, people will in days\nto come be flocking from all sides as if wishing to see some great serpent.'\n\n11:2:7:1313\\. The first butter-portion, doubtless, is the past, and the second\nthe future: verily, he secures for himself both the past and the future; and\nwhatever is to be gained by the past and the future, all that he now gains.\n\np. 41\n\n11:2:7:1414\\. The cake offered to Agni is the Brahman (priesthood); and,\nverily, whosoever knows Agni's cake to be the priesthood secures for himself\nthe priesthood; and whatever is to be gained by the priesthood all that he now\ngains.\n\n11:2:7:1515\\. The low-voiced offering is the Kshatra (nobility); and, verily,\nwhosoever knows the low-voiced offering to be the nobility secures for himself\nthe nobility; and whatever is to be gained by the nobility all that he now\ngains. And inasmuch as some perform the low-voiced offering, and others do\nnot. therefore people speak (give information) to the noble both in a loud\nvoice and in a low voice.\n\n11:2:7:1616\\. The second cake is the Vi _s_ (people); and, verily, whosoever\nknows the second cake to be the people secures for himself the people; and\nwhatever is to be gained by the people all that he gains. And inasmuch as\nAgni's cake and the low-voiced offering come first therefore the priesthood\nand nobility are established upon the people.\n\n11:2:7:1717\\. The Sannayya 1 is royal dignity; and, verily, whosoever knows\nthe Sannayya to be royal dignity secures for himself royal dignity; and\nwhatever is to be gained by royal dignity all that he gains. And inasmuch as\nsome pour (sweet and sour milk) together 2, and others do not, therefore the\nroyal dignity both (combines) together and (keeps) asunder 3.\n\n11:2:7:1818\\. The Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t is fervid devotion; and, verily,\nwhosoever knows the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t to be fervid devotion\n\np. 42\n\nsecures for himself fervid devotion; and whatever is to be gained by fervid\ndevotion all that he now gains.\n\n11:2:7:1919\\. The fore-portion is the place (in heaven); and, verily,\nwhosoever knows the fore-portion to be the place (in heaven) secures for\nhimself the place (in heaven); and whatever is to be gained by the place (in\nheaven) all that he now gains; and, indeed, he does not by ever so little fall\nfrom his place, for it is by ever so little that in yonder world men fall from\ntheir place; and whosoever knows this does not fall from his place however\nmuch evil he may have done.\n\n11:2:7:2020\\. The I _d_ a is faith; and, verily, whosoever knows the I _d_ a\nto be faith secures for himself faith, and whatever is to be gained by faith\nall that he now gains.\n\n11:2:7:2121\\. The first after-offering is the thunderbolt, the second the\nhail-stone, the third the (heavenly) firebrand (meteor).\n\n11:2:7:2222\\. After the first after-offering let him utter (the anumantra _n_\na), 'O thunderbolt, smite N.N.!' (naming) him whom he hates; after the second,\nO hail-stone, smite N.N.!' after the third, 'O firebrand, smite N.N.!'\n\n11:2:7:2323\\. And if such a one dies suddenly, then, indeed, it is that after-\noffering, the thunderbolt, that smites him; and if he is, as it were, covered\nwith out-flowing (blood), then it is that after-offering, the hail-stone, that\nsmites him; and if he is, as it were, covered with scorching, then it is that\nafter-offering, the (heavenly) firebrand, that smites him.\n\n11:2:7:2424\\. Such is the bolt of the sacrifice: it was by that bolt, indeed,\nthat the gods overcame the Asuras;\n\np. 43\n\nand in like manner does the Sacrificer who knows this overcome his wicked,\nspiteful enemy.\n\n11:2:7:2525\\. And if the sacrifice were to end with after-offerings, then it\nwould end with the thunderbolt, the hail-stone, and the (heavenly) firebrand:\ntherefore the sacrifice of the gods ends either with the I _d_ a or with the\n_S_ amyos.\n\n11:2:7:2626\\. By the fore-offerings, indeed, the gods reached the world of\nheaven. The Asuras tried to get thither after them; and by the after-offerings\nthey (the gods) drove them back: thus, when the after-offerings are performed,\nthe Sacrificer drives back his wicked, spiteful enemy.\n\n11:2:7:2727\\. The fore-offerings, indeed, are the out-breathings 1, and the\nafter-offerings the off-breathings wherefore the fore-offerings are poured out\nin a forward direction 2, for that is the form of the out-breathing; and the\nafter-offerings (are poured out) in a backward direction 3, for that is the\nform of the off-breathing. The after-offerings, indeed, are the Upasads 4 of\nthe\n\np. 44\n\n[paragraph continues] Full and New-moon sacrifices, whence they are performed\nin a backward direction after the manner of the Upasads.\n\n11:2:7:2828\\. The Suktavaka is the completion; and, verily, whosoever knows\nthe Suktavaka to be the completion secures for himself the completion; and\nwhatever is to be gained by the completion all that he now gains: he obtains\nthe completion of his (full) lifetime.\n\n11:2:7:2929\\. The _S_ amyorvaka is the resting-place; and, verily, whosoever\nknows the _S_ amyuvaka to be the resting-place secures for himself a resting-\nplace; and whatever is to be gained by a resting-place all that he now gains:\nhe reaches a resting-place.\n\n11:2:7:3030\\. The gods fortified the Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as by a mound from\nbehind 1, and placed a couple thereon for the sake of procreation: thus when\nthe Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as are performed, he places a couple thereon for the\nsake of procreation; for, indeed, after the procreation of the gods offspring\nis produced, and offspring is produced by pair after pair (of men and beasts)\nfor him who knows this.\n\n11:2:7:3131\\. The Samish _t_ aya _g_ us is food; and, verily, whosoever knows\nthe Samish _t_ aya _g_ us to be food secures for himself food; and whatever is\nto be gained by food all that he now gains.\n\n11:2:7:3232\\. The Sacrificer is the Year; and the Seasons officiate for him.\nThe \xc3\x82gnidhra is the Spring,\n\np. 45\n\nwhence forest-fires take place in spring, for that is a form of Agni. The\nAdhvaryu is the Summer, for summer is, as it were, scorched; and the Adhvaryu\ncomes forth (from the sacrificial ground) like something scorched 1. The Udgat\n_ri_ is the Rainy season; whence, when it rains hard, a sound as that of a\nchant is produced. 'The Brahman is the Autumn; whence, when the corn ripens,\nthey say, 'The creatures are rich in growth (brahma _n_ vat).' The Hot _ri_ is\nthe Winter, whence in winter cattle waste away, having the Vasha _t_ uttered\nover them. These, then, are the divinities that officiate for him; and even if\nAishavira _h_  2 were to officiate for him, let him think in his mind of those\ndivinities, and those deities, indeed, officiate for him.\n\n11:2:7:3333\\. Now, as to that balance, the right (south) edge of the Vedi 3.\nWhatever good deed man does that is inside the Vedi; and whatever evil deed he\ndoes that is outside the Vedi. Let him therefore sit down, touching the right\nedge of the Vedi; for, indeed, they place him on the balance in yonder world;\nand whichever of the two will rise 4 that he will follow, whether it be the\ngood or the evil. And, verily, whosoever knows this, mounts the balance even\nin this world, and escapes being placed on the balance in yonder world; for\nhis good deed rises, and not his evil deed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[39:1](sbe44017.htm#fr_162) Saya _n_ a seems to take the two attendants\n(parivesh _t_ ri, preparers or servers-up of food) to mean the pair of fire-\ntongs (dh _ri_ sh _t_ i):--ye parivesha _n_ a-sadhane dh _ri_ sh _t_ i tayor\nahoratrabuddhi _m_ vidhatte.\n\n[40:1](sbe44017.htm#fr_163) Each of the offering-formulas of the Praya _g_ as\nhas after it the anumantra _n_ a 'might is speech, might is energy, in me the\nin-breathing and off-breathing;' which, according to our paragraph (and Katy.\nIII, 3, 5), is to be supplemented by these special prayers.\n\n[40:2](sbe44017.htm#fr_164) See X, 3, 4, 1, with note.\n\n[41:1](sbe44017.htm#fr_165) For this sacrificial dish of the New-moor\nsacrifice, prepared from fresh milk and sour curds, see part i, p. 178, note\n4.\n\n[41:2](sbe44017.htm#fr_166) That is, they prepare the Sannayya.\n\n[41:3](sbe44017.htm#fr_167) That is to say, different kings either combine or\nkeep separate from each other.\n\n[43:1](sbe44017.htm#fr_168) That is, the breath (out and in-breathing) of the\nmouth (pra _n_ a), in comparing which with the fore-offerings (praya _g_ a)\nthe stress is laid on the preposition 'pra.'\n\n[43:2](sbe44017.htm#fr_169) According to Katy. III, 2, 18 seqq., the five\npraya _g_ a libations are to be made either on the part of the fire burning\nthe brightest, or so that each subsequent libation is poured further east of\nthe preceding one.\n\n[43:3](sbe44017.htm#fr_170) According to Katy. III, 5, 10, the three anuya _g_\na libations are to be made on the forepart, the middle, and the back (western)\npart of a burning log respectively.\n\n[43:4](sbe44017.htm#fr_171) For the three days' libations, called Upasada _h_\n(homages or sieges), at the Soma-sacrifice, see part ii, p. 104 seqq. I do not\nquite understand the reference to the 'backward direction' (pratyagapavargatva\n_m_ vopasad-dharma _h_ , Say.) of the Upasads, unless it be that the libations\nare offered to Agni, Soma and Vish _n_ u, who are compared with the point,\nbarb and socket (?) of an arrow p. 44 respectively (III, 4, 4, 14), or that in\nfilling the spoons with ghee, the procedure is the reverse of that usually\nfollowed (III, 4, 4, 7. 8).\n\n[44:1](sbe44017.htm#fr_172) The Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as (by which offering is\nmade to Soma, Tvash _t_ _ri_ , and Agni, along with the wives of the gods) are\nperformed on the Garhapatya fire, and hence at the back (western) part of the\nsacrificial ground where the Sacrificer's wife is seated. For the symbolical\nimport of the rite see I, 9, 2, 5.\n\n[45:1](sbe44017.htm#fr_173) Viz. from his constant attendance on the\nsacrificial fires.\n\n[45:2](sbe44017.htm#fr_174) According to Saya _n_ a, Eshavira is the name of a\nBrahma _n_ ical family held in general contempt. See Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p.\n228.\n\n[45:3](sbe44017.htm#fr_175) That is, the altar-ground covered with sacrificial\ngrass, serving as a seat for the gods.\n\n[45:4](sbe44017.htm#fr_176) Literally, will force down (the other). On this\nordeal see E. Schlagintweit, Die Gottesurtheile der Indier, Nachtrage; A.\nWeber, Ind. Streifen I, p. 21; II, p. 363.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 3, 1. Third Adhyaya.
