With this in mind, you should not identify yourself with objects.\nReaching the Jivanmukta (bodily emancipated) state, you may attain the non-\ndual latent silence and enjoy the final blessedness. So long as the ideas of\nignorance remain with us, so long the Brahmic state will not be reached. As\nlong as there is enjoyment of illusory sense, that long the false creation of\nmind will continue. In fact, neither illusion, nor mind, nor ego exist, but\nthe Shining One, Brahma, alone, which is like a Great Ocean rising and\nfalling. As long as this "I" identifies itself with the body, etc., so long\nthe illusions of the mind exist. So long as one has a love for possession of\nobjects, so long the illusion of the mind will exist. If through the\n\np. 149\n\npure and eternal, the desire for the three worlds be sacrificed in the fire of\nWisdom, then the illusion of mind will drop away. Those who are constantly\nmeditating upon the All Pervading Self, which is the One Wisdom above material\nsense. looking with equal eye upon those who want to feed them and those who\nwant to kill them, they may be said to have realized their Alma. Those who\nhave meditated continually upon the Pure Wisdom and have put an end to the\ndesires are like the sun which dispels darkness. Those who have known the real\nmeaning of AUM (OM) as it should be known, will find. that their minds have\nbecome peaceful. Those who have dried to realize, but have not succeeded in\nseeing the Brahmic Principle, which is pure Wisdom, will be ever like a\nwhirlwind in their mental attitude, or like a dry leaf in a storm.\n\n"Though this Wisdom is imperishable, all beings do not try to attain it and\nare ever downcast. The egoist and the ignorant are attacking from all sides,\nlike arrows on a battle field. These worthless ones will kill their time, but\nwill not try to find the imperishable True Wisdom. To the ignorant, the\nsignificance of OM is like\n\np. 150\n\nunto casting a treasure into the ocean. "Cast not your pearls before swine."\nAll dangers are caused by the ignorant. No danger comes from the wise. This\nMaya (illusion) is that which appears as the only reality to the ignorant.\nThis world is as a shallow pool to the wise, but as a great ocean of pain to\nthe ignorant.\n\n"Reality cannot be realized by the senses. Out of this Reality, which is the\nwitness of all an Intelligence arose, and subject to change, produced three\nstates, the Finer, the Middle, and the Grosser. By these three qualities,\nSattva (goodness), Raja (passion for name and fame) and Tamas (darkness or\ndoing evil), all beings are bound to rebirth. By rising above these three\nqualities, the Brahmic state is attained. This triune may be divided into nine\nclasses each. Under the class of goodness are: Rishi, Munis, Nagas, Sidhas,\nVidyadharas, Devas, and others. Nagas and Vidyadhara come under the Tamasic\naspect of the Sattva. Sidhas and Munis come under the Rajasic aspect. All the\nothers come under the Sattva aspect of Truth fulness. The Vidya (knowledge)\narose out of Avidya (ignorance). This Vidya is no other than\n\np. 151\n\nthe Avidya itself. Again it is stated that Raja and Tamas each have their\nthree divisions. The Tamasic intelligence has to live within the ignorant\nbody."\n\nRam asked: "How came the Intelligence to be entangled in the ignorant body?"\n\nRishi Vashisht replied: "The Intelligence, when it is without meditation, will\nfirst be as in a wild savage state; then it reaches the middle state between\ntruth and untruth, and finally Wisdom, which has been lying dormant within the\nfiner body. It will be idle as an indolent person without pains, until\nawakened by the Absolute One."\n\nRam asked: "Why not consider the fixed state of objects in the universe as\nliberation, as long as the Intelligence is in harmony with One-ness?"\n\nMaster Vashisht answered: "The attainment of the One-ness belongs to all\nbeings. When one knows what is real and what is not real, that is the Supreme\nLiberation. When all desires have been sacrificed on the fire of Wisdom,\nthen,. one attains the state of One-ness and Freedom..\n\np. 152\n\n[paragraph continues] As a tree is in the seed, so are the desires within the\nheart. This is the dreamless state from which arose all rebirths, the cause of\nall desires within the heart. After the different worldly thoughts are killed,\nthen the mischief maker, (the cause of pains) goes to sleep--goes to the\ndreamless state--but arises again and again, like a tree from the seed, or\ndust from the earth. The unkilled desires will be hiding within the heart.\nThis dreamless state, which is the mother of all desires, cannot be called\nliberation. The only one which is not the seed of that dreamless state is\nliberation or freedom. We should not be friendly to our enemy, namely impure\ndesires, which like fire or poison, will ruin our life. The person who has\ndone away with impure desires will never be affected by pain. The powers of\nmind are desires; its seed is ignorance. The wise stated that not to realize\nthe eternal wisdom is the Avidya (ignorance). Do away with all ignorance and\nunreality and become nondual. Believe that this universe is the Brahma and not\nAvidya (ignorance). To understand and see this universe as Brahma, alone is\nthe emancipation. May you be blessed with that certain understanding which is\nfound within the pure minds\n\np. 153\n\nof Rishis and other great ones."\n\nRam asked: "Will you please enlighten me concerning the painless state of the\nGreat One?"\n\nThe Master replied: "All varieties of things, whether large or small, are only\nBrahma. Wisdom is Brahma. We are Brahma. Our friends, kinsmen and our enemies\nare Brahma. To the blind this universe seems dark, but it is shining to those\nwho have eyes to see; it is blissful to the wise, but painful to the ignorant.\nHe, who sees and realizes this universe as Brahma, is Brahma himself; he will\nnever miss immortality.\n\n"The spotless is the self alone, which shines everywhere. That silent wisdom\nis Brahma, which will become a direct perception when a, person sees only one\nalone. The wisdom which exists then is called the all-pervading wisdom of\nBrahma, and that is what we are.\n\nLet us call that, Atma, which gives us the fruits of all thoughts, which is\nthe Light of Lights and which is neither with nor without qualities. Let us\noffer our solution to that Pure Wisdom which is devoid of all thoughts,\npleasures or pains. Those who have conviction of the nothingness\n\np. 154\n\nof thoughts and who act according to truth only, will enjoy the highest of the\nBrahmic state, which is filled with truth, quietness and equality. Those brave\npersons whose minds are filled with pure wisdom, and are looking with equal\neyes over all, are free from desires, and will never become slaves of any\nthing."\n\nRam; said: "Please explain the two paths through which the Jivanmukta (body\nemancipated) has freed himself from all pains and desires.\n\nMaster Vashisht replied: "There are two methods of Yoga to overcome dire\npains. The two are True Wisdom and the Control of Prana (vital force), which\nare given out by Paramesuara [i.e., Parameshwara--JBH.] (Shiva). To the\nconstitution of some, Yoga is the most desirable; also, to the constitution of\nothers, knowledge is preferable. These two, as I have explained, are based\nupon True Wisdom. *\n\n"Now I shall explain the meaning of Yoga. I shall tell you a beautiful story.\nOnce upon a time I was in the company of other Rishis and heard from them the\nstory of the long-lived Yogin. A little hut was built in the top of the Kalpa\nTree (a tree that produces what one wishes).\n\np. 155\n\n[paragraph continues] This was a lofty one, on the northeast, side of the top\nof a big mountain. In that hut lived Bhusunde, a Yogin. There was no one in\nHeaven nor on earth who could sit with this Yogin in his practice of Yoga.\nThis Yogin was the longest lived Yogin in the world, and was without desire.\nHe possessed the wealth of liberation, and could see clearly the three periods\nof time. When the story was finished by the Great One in the assembly of the\ngreat, I was very eager to go and see personally, the long-lived Yogin. So I\ndid, and saw the tree, the mountain with its slopes and caves and flowers in\nfull bloom. On the tree were sitting many colored birds (persons), some\nchanting Samaveda, others Mantras. Many parrots, kokilas, peacocks, and\nothers. were developing in knowledge. Then I came before the long-lived Yogin,\nwho was amid the-others. He was in perfect silence, without any motion of\nPrana (vital force) and was enjoying bliss within himself. He came to greet\nme, and was overcome with joy when he recognized me. He welcomed me with kind\nwords, and beautiful bunches of flowers which he produced by the power of his\nthought. He asked me to be seated, and showed me much kindness and courtesy.\nHe\n\np. 156\n\nsaid to me: \'I am overjoyed by thy visit. Thou hast taken a long journey. By\nthy holy presence I have known all. All the learned ones think of me;\ntherefore, thou hast come here, too. I wish to sip the nectar of thy words.\'\n\n"I said: \'It is true, as thou hast stated, O King of birds (men) . I came here\nto see thee, who hast been here a very long time. To what race dost thou trace\nthy family? How didst thou attain pure Wisdom? How long hast thou been in the\npresent body? What hast thou learned about Nature\'s laws? By which Wisdom hast\nthou been here? Please answer.\'\n\n"The long-lived One replied: \'In the best company of Supreme Shiva (who is\nhigher than the Hindu Trinity), who is elephant faced, sheep faced, camel\nfaced, bear faced, etc.. Many of them have different heads, hands, etc.. These\nelementals (beings) will encircle around Shiva at Kailasa Hills (holiest\nmountain in the Himalayas). The Saktis (powers) will dance before Him, having\ntheir abode everywhere. These powers have different names, which are according\nto their degrees and forms (bodies). Once upon a lime, a crow by the name of\nChanda (an element)\n\np. 157\n\nwent to a meeting ordered by Shiva, where all Saktis (powers and elements) get\ntogether to celebrate the great festival in the sky, where they dance and\nlaugh with intoxication. The Chanda (elements) sported himself with the female\nswan (another Saktis or element), and by the joining of the two, the female\nswan became pregnant. When the dance was over, the pregnant swan of the power\ntold the fact, of the incident of the conception, to their head one.\n\n"\'Thereupon, the Saktis power spoke: \'Thou art pregnated by destiny. Thou wilt\nnot be able to hold our pace, hence thou must live according to thy free\nwill.\' Saying this, Devi (God) went to the highest Samadhi.\n\n"\'My mother and father lived on Manasa Lake, and I, and my twenty brothers and\nsisters were born there, lived with our parents, and worshipped the Brahma\npower for a long time. Devi (divine Mother) awoke from her Samadhi and blessed\nus with her love--with liberation. Great peace was established within our\nhearts thereafter. In order to live alone without mixed associates, we said\nfarewell to our parents. We attained liberation through the grace of a Sakti\n\np. 158\n\n(spiritual power). We asked for a place where divine bliss could be enjoyed.\nWe were directed to this place, giving thanks for the liberation, or freedom.\nWe came here to live free from pain. All the karma I had made up to that date\nwas now bearing fruit.\n\n"\'What will not be blessed by the Brahmic bliss? All good things arise by the\ngrace of the wise. I am a knower of Brahma, and will free myself soon of all\nmaterial existence, by thy visit. This birth of mine is full of wonderful\nexperience. You know, as thou art Iswara (God), himself. By saying this, he\nincreased his respect to me.\'\n\n"I asked him how his brothers and sisters parted from him.\n\n"\'Here we lived for many yugas (a yuga is more than four million years.\nRelative to "yugas" see page [80](yvhf08.htm#page_80), Great Master of the\nHimalayas). At last my brothers and sisters wearied of the body and gave it up\nfor liberation. They were blessed with great power and longevity and\ndisappeared at will."\n\np. 159\n\n"I asked him: \'How did you save yourself at the time of pralaya, when the\ntwelve suns melted all the universe?\'\n\n"The long-lived Yogin answered: \'Do you think that action of nature will ever\nstop? At the time of pralaya, when the twelve suns melted the universe, I gave\nup this place of mine and by the Dharana I went up to the sky. When the\nmountains burst forth, red hot rocks were thrown high into the air. I changed\nto the Fire Dharana (one who practices Fire Dharana cannot be burned by the\nfire). When all the world was sunk under the water, I floated by the Air\nDharana. When the time came for the destruction of the universe, I took the\nBrahmic state and remained there until the beginning of creation over again.\nAfter the new creation, I returned again to this place. As for living, by my\npower, I rose above the mountains and created this tree.\n\n"I interrupted him and asked: \'By Dharana you preserved long life, while other\nYogis perished?\'\n\n"The long-lived one answered: \'No, they did not perish, but they got tired of\nthe burden of the human body and gave it up at will.\'\n\np. 160\n\n"I asked him: \'You are master of all divine wisdom, and you see three worlds\nby the marvelous power of Yoga. I desire to know what you have seen.\'\n\n"The long lived one explained: \'For eleven thousand years of Devas there was\none nebulous mass, devoid of anything. The next four yugas, over 11,000,000\nyears, there was a forest; the next four yugas over 11,000,000 years, this\nearth was a chain of mountains; the next four yugas, this earth was\noverspread. Then Brahma became crafty and created by his will. At that time,\nmen and women were not chaste but did as they liked. O Vashisht, I was witness\nto all these; the origin of the sun, and such like. I saw Vishnu, one of the\nTrinity, who preserves, saving the earth and gathering together the Vedas (the\nholy book of knowledge) that was scattered in all directions. Many of these\nhappenings, juniors may be able to tell thee, but you should know there have\nbeen countless Avatars (Christs), and it is difficult to count their number. O\nGreat One, thou hast reincarnated eight times; this is our eighth meeting.\n\n"\'First, thou wert born of Akasa (ether or\n\np. 161\n\nair), then of fire, and then of water. I have witnessed this and seen great\nones like Buddha reincarnated, and many others. The eternal Vedas (the Wisdom)\nwill arise again and again in every age, as suited to human beings. They will\nunderstand it more and more.\n\n"\'As they advance, pure wisdom will be embodied in every yuga in the shape of\nRamayana, like this one recited by Rishi Valmik. Twelve Valmiks had been\nbefore this one. They wrought the same wisdom in the form of Ramayana. Notable\nVyasa composed Mahabhart. The Ram has been on this earth eleven times. He will\nincarnate again in the wealthy house. The illusion of this world sometimes\nwill manifest, and other times not. All this illusion will be hidden within\nthe Atma (self), as the foam in the ocean some times arises and again\ndisappears. So I have seen the universe come and go.\'\n\n"I interrupted him by asking: \'When acting in a worldly way, how did you save\nyourself from the hands of death?\'\n\n"The long-lived one answered: \'What good will they gain if they will not act\nas the great\n\np. 162\n\nones have advised? You know all, but I will explain to thee. Yama (death) will\nnot come to those whose minds are above pain. Death will not come to those who\nhave mastered the serpent of desire. Yama (death) will not come to those whose\nminds have attained peace; death will not come to those who have overcome the\nserpent of greed; yama (death) will not come to those who have control of\nanger and passion; death will not tome to those who have reached the highest\ndivine state by daily meditation; death will not come to those who have\nattained the non-dual state. Mental diseases and pain will not reach those who\nare non-dual, but have equal vision upon all.\n\n"The mind should be kept under control. It should not become abstract on the\nway to reaching the highest state which is the Atma, or God, where no\ndifferentiation of this or that exists, having overcome all fear. Reaching\nthis state is a difficult work, as it is all Bliss, without pain, and cannot\nbe attained by the ignorant, who are roaming in the darkness. Wisdom is the\nway which leads to the state of highest bliss, the control of Prana, which is\nthe way to control old age and death.\'\n\np. 163\n\n"I then asked him, \'will you please explain what it means to control Prana.\'\n\n"The long-lived one answered: \'Within this body, composed of the five\nelements, there are two vital forces, Prana and Apana. These two forces run\nsmoothly, one upward and the other downward. Both are very fine forces and\nproduce vibration. When these forces are arrested, then the Yogi can do most\nwonderful things, and he knows all. One should always practice to control the\nPrana and Apana, as that leads to liberation and sets one free from rebirth.\'\n\n"\'How can pain arise when one has mixed Apana in the Prana or Prana in the\nApana? When Prana and Apana become as one, there will be no more pain or\ndeath. I followed this course. After controlling Prana, I attained the Supreme\nState. I do not care for the past nor the future, but only the present. I do\nnot recognize that, by one course or another, I have succeeded in living a\nlong life. I am all things to all men,--with the married I am married, with\nthe suffering I suffer, with the happy I rejoice, as I am one with the whole\nuniverse.\n\np. 164\n\n"\'My own life has been a happy one, free from pain, riches or poverty which do\nnot affect me. My long life is due to the absence of egoism, and to thy grace.\nWith pure Wisdom I am blessed.\'\n\n"Thus did the long-lived one end his story. I said to him: \'I am enchanted\nwith all that you have related. It is indeed marvelous. May your glory shine\nas the sun. May I start on my way.\'\n\n"So I started by air. He accompanied me many miles; then I forced him back to\nhis palace. It was heart-rending to part with such a wise one.\n\n"O Ram, this is the path of the Long-Lived Yogin. O Ram."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[154:*](yvhf12.htm#fr_16) See Chapter on "The Goal of the Yogi.
