For the True and so on are one and the same (vidya).\n\nThe text of the Va _g_ asaneyaka, after having enjoined the knowledge of the\nTrue, together with a meditation on the syllables of its name ('Whosoever\nknows this great glorious first-born as the true Brahman,' &c., B _ri_. Up. V,\n4, 1), continues, 'Now what is the True, that is the \xc3\x82ditya, the person that\ndwells in yonder orb, and the person in the right eye' (V, 5, 2).--The doubt\nhere arises whether the text enjoins two vidyas of the True or one only.\n\nTwo, the purvapakshin maintains. For the text declares two different results,\none in the earlier passage, 'He conquers these worlds' (V, 4, 1); the other\none later on. 'He destroys evil and leaves it' (V, 5, 3). And what our\nopponent may call a reference to the subject-matter under discussion, 1 is\nmerely due to the circumstance of the object of meditation being the same (in\nthe two vidyas).\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--There is only one vidya of the True,\nbecause the clause, 'That which is the True,' &c., refers back to that True\nwhich is treated\n\np. 246\n\nof in V, 4.--But has not the purvapakshin shown that the clause alluded to can\nbe accounted for even on the supposition of there being two vidyas?--The\nreasoning of the purvapakshin, we reply, would be admissible only if the\nseparateness of the two vidyas were established by some other clear and\nundoubted reason; in our ease, however, there is a general possibility of both\n(viz. of the vidyas being separate or not), and the very circumstance that the\nmentioned clause contains a back reference to the True spoken of in V, 4,\ndetermines us to conclude that there is only one vidya of the True.--To the\nremark that there must be two vidyas because the text states two different\nresults, we reply that the statement of a second result merely has the purpose\nof glorifying the new instruction given about the True, viz. that its secret\nnames are ahar and aham. Moreover, as in the case under discussion, the fruit\nof the vidya has really to be supplied from its arthavada part 1, and as there\nis unity of vidya, all those fruits which the text states in connexion with\nthe single parts of the vidya are to be combined and put in connexion with the\nvidya taken as a whole.--The conclusion therefore is that the text records\nonly one vidya of the True, distinguished by such and such details, and that\nhence all the qualities mentioned, such as Truth and so on, are to be\ncomprehended in one act of meditation.\n\nSome commentators are of opinion that the above Sutra refers (not to the\nquestion whether B _ri_. Up. V, 4 and V, 5 constitute one vidya but) to the\nquestion whether the Va _g_ asaneyaka-passage about the persons in the sun and\nin the eye, and the similar _Kh_ andogya-passage (I, 6, 6, 'Now that golden\nperson who is seen within the sun,' &c.) form one vidya or not. They conclude\nthat they do so, and that hence truth and the other qualities mentioned in\n\np. 247\n\nthe Va _g_ asaneyaka are to be combined with the _Kh_ andogya-text also.--But\nthis interpretation of the Sutra appears objectionable. For the _Kh_ andogya-\nvidya refers to the udgitha and is thus connected with sacrificial acts, marks\nof which connexion are exhibited in the beginning, the middle, and the end of\nthe vidya. Thus we read at the beginning, 'The _Ri_ _k_ is the earth, the\nSaman is fire;' in the middle, ' _Ri_ _k_ and Saman are his joints and\ntherefore he is udgitha;' and in the end, 'He who knowing this sings a Saman'\n( _Kh_. Up. I, 6, 1; 8; I, 7, 7). In the Va _g_ asaneyaka, on the other hand,\nthere is nothing to connect the vidya with sacrificial acts. As therefore the\nsubject-matter is different, the vidyas are separate and the details of the\ntwo are to be held apart.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[245:1](sbe38181.htm#fr_154) Viz. the clause in V, 5, 2, 'That which is the\ntrue,' which apparently--or really--connects the vidya of V, 5 with that of V,\n4.\n\n[246:1](sbe38181.htm#fr_155) For the vidya contains no explicit statement that\na man desirous of such and such a fruit is to meditate on the True in such and\nsuch a way.--That in cases where the fruit is not stated in a vidhi-passage it\nmust be supplied from the arthavada-passages, is taught in the Pu. Mi. Su. IV,\n3, eighth adhikara _n_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 39](sbe38182.htm)\n\n"
