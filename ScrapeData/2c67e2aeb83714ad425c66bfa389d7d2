The Devi said:--Getting up from the bed early in the morning, one is to\nmeditate on the thousand petalled lotus, bright, of the colour of camphor, in\nthe top part his brain on the head. On this he should remember his S\'ri Guru,\nvery gracious looking, well decorated with ornaments, with His Consort S\'akti\nand bow down to Him and within Him he should meditate the Ku _nd_ alini Devi\nthus --"I take refuge unto that Highest S\'akti Ku _nd_ alini, of the nature of\nthe Supreme Consciousness, Who is manifest as Chaityana while up-going to the\nBrahmarandhra (the aperture supposed to be at the crown of the head, through\nwhich the soul takes its flight at death) and Who is of the nature of nectar\nwhile returning back in the Su _s_ umna canal. After meditating thus, he\nshould meditate on the Blissful Form of Mine within the Ku _nd_ alini Fire\nsituated in the Muladhara Lotus (coccygeal lotus). Then he should rise up to\ngo for the calls of nature, etc., and complete Sandhya Bandanams and other\nduties. The best of the Brahmi _n_ s, then, should for My satisfaction perform\nthe Agnihotra Homa and sitting in his \xc3\x82sana make Sankalap (determination) to\ndo My Puja (Worship).\n\n_N. B._ \\--The brain has three divisions, the lower, the middle and the\nhigher, or top-most part which is very pure.\n\n6-10. Next he is to make Bhuta S\'uddhi (purification of elements of the body\nby respiratory attraction and replacement) and then the Matrika Nyasa, Then he\nshould arrange the letters of the root Mantra of Maya and execute the\nHrillekha Matrika Nyasa. In this he is to place the letter "Ha" in the\nMuladhara, the letter "Ra" in his heart and the vowel "i" in the middle of his\nbrows aud, Hrim on the top part of his head. Finishing\n\np. 738\n\nthen all the other Nyasas according to that Mantra, he should think within his\nbody Dharma, J\xc3\xb1ana, Vairagyam, and Prosperity as the four legs of the seat and\nAdharma, Aj\xc3\xb1ana, Avairagyam and non-prosperity, these four as the body of the\nseat on the four quarters East, South, West and North. Then he should meditate\non the Great Devi in the lotus of his heart blewn by Pra _n_ ayama, situated\non the five seats of the Pretas. O Mountain! Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Rudra,\nSadas\'iva and \xc3\x8es\'vara are the five Pretas situated under My feet.\n\n11\\. These are of the nature of earth, water, fire, air, and ether, the five\nelements and also of the nature of Jagrat (waking), Svapna (dreaming) Su _s_\nupti (deep sleep state) Turiya (the fourth state) and Atita Rupa, the (the\nfifth state) excluding the 4 states, corresponding to the five states. But I,\nwho am of the nature of Brahma, am over and above the five elements and the\nfive states; therefore My Seat is always on the top of these five forces.\n\n12\\. Meditating on Me thus and worshipping Me with his mind concentrated, he\nis next to make Japam (reciting My name slowly). After Japam he is to make\nover the fruits of Japam to Me. He should then place the Arghya for the\nexternal worship.\n\n13\\. Then the worshipper is to sprinkle with the Astra mantra \'Pha _t_ \', all\nthe articles of worship that are placed in front of him and purify them.\n\n14-18. He should close the ten quarters with the Chho _t_ ika Mudra and bow\ndown to his Guru. Taking his permission, he should meditate on the outside\nseat, the beauiful divine form of his heart lotus and invoke the Deity outside\nand place Her on the seat by Pra _n_ a Prati _st_ ha and perforn \xc3\x82vahana, and\npresent to Her Arghya (an offer of green grass, rice, etc., made in\nworshipping a god), Padya (water for washing legs and feet), \xc3\x82chaman, water\nfor bath, a couple of clothes, all sorts of ornaments, or scents, flowers and\nthe necessary articles with due devotion and he should worship the attendant\ndeities of the Yantra. If one be unable to worship daily the attendant\ndeities, one must worship them on Friday.\n\n19\\. Of the attendant deities, one must meditate the principal deity of the\nnature of Prabha (illumination) and think that by Her rays the three worlds\nare pervaded.\n\n20\\. Next he should worship again the Bhuvanes\'vari Devi, the Chief Deity\nalong with other attendant deities with scent, good smelling flowers; and\nNaivedya and various other tasteful dishes.\n\np. 739\n\n21-22. He should then recite the Sahasranama (thousand names) stotra and the\nDevi Sukta Mantra "Aham Rudrebhih, etc.," and "Sarve vai Deva Devi mupatasthu\n_h,_ etc.," the Devi Atharva S\'iro Mantra and the Upani _s_ ads\' Mantra of\nBhuvanes\'vari, the famous mantras, repeatedly and thus bring My satisfaction.\n\n23-24. With hearts filled with love and with hairs standing on their ends all\nshould satisfy Me frequently with tears of love flowing from their eyes and\nwith voice choked with feelings and with dancing music and singing and with\nhis whole body filled with joy.\n\n25\\. My glory is well established in the Veda Parayana and in all the Pura _n_\nas. So for My satisfaction, one should offer daily to Me one\'s everything with\none\'s body and recite the readings from the Vedas.\n\n26-27. Next, after completing the Homa offerings, he should feed the Brahma\n_n_ as, tha young virgins well clothed, the boys and the public and the poor,\nthinking all of them to be so many forms of the Devi. Than he should bow\nbefore the Devi that resides in his heart and finally by Samhara Mudra take\nleave of the Deity invoked.\n\n28\\. O One of good vows! The Hrillekha Mantra (Hrim) is the chief of all\nmantrams; so My worship and all other actions ought to be performed with this\nHrillekha Mantram.\n\n29\\. I am always reflected in this Mirror of Hrillekha form; so anything\noffered in this Hrillekha Mantra of Mine is offered as it were with all the\nMantras. Then one should worship the Guru with ornaments, etc., and think\noneself blessed.\n\n30-31. O Himavan! Nothing remains at any time unavailable to him who worships\nthus the Bhuvanes\'vari Devi. After quitting his body, he goes to theMa _n_ i\nDvipa, My Place. He gets the form of the Devi; and the Devas constantly bow\ndown to him.\n\n32-45. O Mahidhara! Thus I have described to you the rules of worshipping the\nGreat Devi; consider this in all the aspects and worship Me according to your\nAdhikara (claim) and you will attain your Goal. There is no doubt in this. O\nBest of mountains! This S\'astra Devigita you are not to tell to those who are\nnot the devotees, to those who are enemies, and to those who are cunning. If\none gives out this secret of Gita, it is like taking off the covering from the\nbreast of the mother; so carefully keep it secret and think that this is very\nnecessary. This Devi Gita ought to be given to a disciple, a Bhakta, the\neldest son, and\n\np. 740\n\nto one who is good natured, and well dressed and devoted to the Devi. O\nMountain! In the time of S\'raddha (solemn obsequies performed in honour of the\nmanes of deceased ancestors) he gets the highest place of the Pitris who reads\nthis Devi Gita before the Brahma _n_ as. Vyasa said:-- The Devi vanished there\nafter describing all these. The Devas were glad and considered themselves\nblessed by the sight of the Devi. O Janamejaya! The Haimavati next took Her\nbirth in the house of the Himalaya and was known by the name of Gauri. S\'a _n_\nkara, the Deva of the Devas, marricd Her. _S_ a _d_ anana (Kartika) was born\nof them. He killed the Ta _d_ aka Asura. O King! In ancient times, when the\nocean was churned, many gems were obtained. At that time the Devas chanted\nhymns to the Devi with a concentrated mind to get Lak _s_ mi Devi. To show\nfavour to the Devas, Rama Devi got out of the ocean. The Devas gave La _ks_ mi\nto Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of the Vaiku _nt_ ha. Vi _sn_ u was very glad at this.\nO King! Thus I have described to you the Greatness of the Devi and the birth\nof Gauri and Lak _s_ mi. One\'s desires are all fulfilled when one hears this.\nO King! This secret I have described to you. Take care not to divulge it to\nany other body. This is the secret of the Gita; so carefully conceal it. O One\nof pure heart! I have told to you this Divine and Sin-destroying narration,\nthat you asked. What more do you want to hear? Say.\n\nHere ends the Fortieth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the External Worship of\nthe Devi in the Mahapura _n_ am, S\'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses,\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n[The.
