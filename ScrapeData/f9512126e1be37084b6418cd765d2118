The absence of restriction is as in the case of perception.\n\nJust as this Self, although free with regard to perception, yet perceives\nunrestrictedly what is unpleasant as well as what is pleasant, so we assume\nthat it also brings about what is unpleasant as well as what is pleasant.--The\nobjection that in the act of perception also the soul is not free because it\ndepends on the employment of the causes of perception (i.e. the sense-organs),\nwe invalidate by the remark that the use of the causes of perception is merely\nto present the objects of perception, that however in the act of perception\nthe soul because endowed with intelligence does not depend on anything else 1.\n--Moreover in actions also the soul is not absolutely free, as it depends on\ndifferences of place, time, and efficient causes. But an agent does not cease\nto be so because he requires assistance. A cook remains the agent in the\naction of cooking although he requires fuel, water, and so on. The presence of\na plurality of cooperating factors is therefore not opposed to the activity of\nthe soul unrestrictedly extending to actions productive of pleasant as well as\nunpleasant results.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[51:1](sbe38038.htm#fr_32) _K_ akshuradina _m_ vishayopanayakatvat\ntadupalabdhau _k_ atmana _s_ _k_ etanatvena svatantryad udahara _n_ asiddhir\nity aha neti. \xc3\x82n.
