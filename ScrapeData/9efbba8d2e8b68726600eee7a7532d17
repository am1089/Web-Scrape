And there is need of all (works), on account\n\np. 699\n\nof the scriptural statement of sacrifices and the rest; as in the case of the\nhorse.\n\nIf knowledge (meditation), without any reference to sacrifices and the like,\nis able to bring about immortality, it must be capable of accomplishing this\nin the case of householders also; and the mention made of sacrifices and the\nrest in texts such as 'Brahma _n_ as seek to know him by the study of the\nVeda, by sacrifice, by gifts' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22), does not prove\nsacrifices and so on to be auxiliary to knowledge, since the stress there lies\n(not on the sacrifices and so on, but) on the desire of knowledge.--Of this\nview the Sutra disposes. In the case of householders, for whom the Agnihotra\nand so on are obligatory, knowledge presupposes all those works, since\nscriptural texts such as the one quoted directly state that sacrifices and the\nlike are auxiliary to knowledge. 'They seek to know by means of sacrifices'\ncan be said only if sacrifices are understood to be a means through which\nknowledge is brought about; just as one can say 'he desires to slay with a\nsword,' because the sword is admitted to be an instrument wherewith one can\nkill. What we have to understand by knowledge in this connexion has been\nrepeatedly explained, viz. a mental energy different in character from the\nmere cognition of the sense of texts, and more specifically denoted by such\nterms as dhyana or upasana, i.e. meditation; which is of the nature of\nremembrance (i.e. representative thought), but in intuitive clearness is not\ninferior to the clearest presentative thought (pratyaksha); which by constant\ndaily practice becomes ever more perfect, and being duly continued up to death\nsecures final Release. Such meditation is originated in the mind through the\ngrace of the Supreme Person, who is pleased and conciliated by the different\nkinds of acts of sacrifice and worship duly performed by the Devotee day after\nday. This is what the text 'they seek to know through the sacrifice' really\nmeans. The conclusion therefore is that in the case of householders knowledge\nhas for its pre-requisite all sacrifices and other works of permanent\n\np. 700\n\nand occasional obligation. 'As a horse.' As the horse, which is a means of\nlocomotion for man, requires attendants, grooming, &c., so knowledge, although\nitself the means of Release, demands the co-operation of the different works.\nThus the Lord himself says, 'The work of sacrifice, giving, and austerities is\nnot to be relinquished, but is indeed to be performed; for sacrifices, gifts,\nand austerities are purifying to the thoughtful.' 'He from whom all beings\nproceed and by whom all this is pervaded-worshipping Him with the proper works\nman attains to perfection ' (Bha. Gi. XVIII, 5; 46).--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'the need of all.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 27. But all the same he must be possessed of calmness...](sbe48474.htm)\n\n"
