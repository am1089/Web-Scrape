By the supremely profound words, on the discrimination of Self, that have\nbeen spoken by Thee out of compassion towards me, this my delusion is gone.\n\np. 242\n\n2\\. Of Thee, O lotus-eyed, I have heard at length, of the origin and\ndissolution of beings, as also Thy inexhaustible greatness.\n\n3\\. So it is, O Lord Supreme! as Thou hast declared Thyself. (Still) I desire\nto see Thy Ishvara-Form, O Purusha Supreme. 3\n\np. 243\n\n4\\. If, O Lord, Thou thinkest me capable of seeing it, then, O Lord of Yogis,\nshow me Thy immutable Self.\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n5\\. Behold, O son of Pritha, by hundreds and thousands, My different forms\ncelestial, of various colours and shapes.\n\np. 244\n\n6\\. Behold the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the twin Ashvins, and the\nMaruts; behold, O descendant of Bharata, many wonders never seen before.\n\n7\\. See now, O Gudakesha, in this My body, the whole universe centred in one,\n--including the moving and the unmoving,--and all else that thou desirest to\nsee. 7\n\np. 245\n\n8\\. But thou canst not see Me with these eyes of thine; I give thee\nsupersensuous sight; behold My Yoga Power Supreme. 8\n\nSanjaya said:\n\n9\\. Having thus spoken, O King, Hari, the Great Lord of Yoga, showed unto the\nson of Pritha, His Supreme Ishvara-Form--\n\np. 246\n\n10\\. With numerous mouths and eyes, with numerous wondrous sights, with\nnumerous celestial ornaments, with numerous celestial weapons uplifted;\n\n11\\. Wearing celestial garlands and apparel, anointed with celestial-scented\nunguents, the All-wonderful, Resplendent, Boundless and All-formed.\n\n12\\. If the splendour of a thousand suns were to rise up at once in the sky,\nthat would be like the splendour of that Mighty Being. 12\n\np. 247\n\n13\\. There in the body of the God of gods, the son of Pandu then saw the whole\nuniverse resting in one, with its manifold divisions.\n\n14\\. Then Dhananjaya, filled with wonder, with his hair standing on end,\nbending down his head to the Deva in adoration, spoke with joined palms. 14\n\np. 248\n\nArjuna said:\n\n15\\. I see all the Devas, O Deva, in Thy body, and hosts of all grades of\nbeings; Brahma, the Lord, seated on the lotus, and all the Rishis and\ncelestial serpents.\n\np. 249\n\n16\\. I see Thee of boundless form on every side with manifold arms, stomachs,\nmouths and eyes; neither the end nor the middle, nor also the beginning of\nThee do I see, O Lord of the universe, O Universal Form.\n\n17\\. I see Thee with diadem, club, and discus; a mass of radiance shining\neverywhere, very hard to look at, all around blazing like burning fire and\nsun, and immeasurable.\n\np. 250\n\n18\\. Thou art the Imperishable, the Supreme Being, the one thing to be known.\nThou art the great Refuge of this universe;. Thou art the undying Guardian of\nthe Eternal Dharma, Thou art the Ancient. Purusha, I ween.\n\np. 251\n\n19\\. I see Thee without beginning, middle or end, infinite in power, of\nmanifold arms; the sun and the moon Thine eyes, the burning fire Thy mouth;\nheating the whole universe with Thy radiance.\n\n20\\. The space betwixt heaven and earth and all the quarters are filled by\nThee alone; having seen this, Thy marvellous and awful Form, the three worlds\nare trembling with fear, O Great-souled One.\n\np. 252\n\n21\\. Verily, into Thee enter these hosts of Devas; some extol Thee in fear\nwith joined palms; "May it be well!" thus saying, bands of great Rishis and\nSiddhas praise Thee with splendid hymns.\n\n22\\. The Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas, Vishva-Devas, the two Ashvins,\nMaruts, Ushmapas, and hosts of Gandharvas, Yakshas, Asuras, and Siddhas,--all\n\np. 253\n\nthese are looking at Thee, all quite astounded. 22\n\n23\\. Having seen Thy immeasurable Form--with many mouths and eyes, O mighty-\narmed, with many arms, thighs and feet, with many stomachs, and fearful with\nmany tusks,--the worlds are terrified, and so am I.\n\np. 254\n\n24\\. On seeing Thee touching the sky, shining in many a colour, with mouths\nwide open, with large fiery eyes, I am terrified at heart, and find no courage\nnor peace, O Vishnu.\n\n25\\. Having seen Thy mouths, fearful with tusks, (blazing) like Pralaya-fires,\nI know not the four quarters, nor do I find peace; have mercy, O Lord of the\nDevas, O Abode of the universe. 25\n\np. 255\n\n26-27. All these sons of Dhritarashtra, with hosts of monarchs, Bhishma,\nDrona,\n\np. 256\n\nand Sutaputra, with the warrior chiefs of ours, enter precipitately into Thy\nmouth, terrible with tusks and fearful to behold. Some are found sticking in\nthe interstices of Thy teeth, with their heads crushed to powder. 26\n\n28\\. Verily, as the many torrents of rivers flow towards the ocean, so do\nthese heroes in the world of men enter Thy fiercely flaming mouths.28\n\np. 257\n\n29\\. As moths precipitately rush into a blazing fire only to perish, even so\ndo these creatures also precipitately rush into Thy mouths only to perish. 28\n\n30\\. Swallowing all the worlds on every side with Thy flaming mouths, Thou are\nlicking Thy lips. Thy fierce rays, filling\n\np. 258\n\nthe whole world with radiance, are burning, O Vishnu! 30\n\n31\\. Tell me who Thou art, fierce in form. Salutation to Thee, O Deva Supreme;\nhave mercy. I desire to know Thee, O Primeval One. I know not indeed Thy\npurpose.\n\np. 259\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n32\\. I am the mighty world-destroying Time, here made manifest for the purpose\nof infolding the world. Even without thee, none of the warriors arrayed in the\nhostile armies shall live. 32\n\np. 260\n\n33\\. Therefore do thou arise and acquire fame. Conquer the enemies, and enjoy\nthe unrivalled dominion. Verily by Myself have they been already slain; be\nthou merely an apparent cause, O Savyasachin (Arjuna). 33\n\n34\\. Drona, Bhishma, Jayadratha, Karna, as well as other brave warriors,--\n\np. 261\n\nthese already killed by Me, do thou kill. Be not distressed with fear; fight,\nand thou shalt conquer thy enemies in battle. 34\n\nSanjaya said:\n\n35\\. Having, heard that speech of Keshava, the diademed one (Arjuna), with\njoined palms, trembling, prostrated himself, and again addressed Krishna in a\n\np. 262\n\nchoked voice, bowing down, overwhelmed with fear.\n\nArjuna said:\n\n36\\. It is meet, O Hrishikesha, that the world is delighted and rejoices in\nThy praise, that Rakshasas fly in fear to all quarters and all the hosts of\nSiddhas bow down to Thee in adoration.\n\np. 263\n\n37\\. And why should they not, O Great-souled One, bow to Thee, greater than,\nand the Primal Cause of even Brahma, O Infinite Being, O Lord of the Devas, O\nAbode of the universe? Thou art the Imperishable, the Being and the non-Being,\n(as well as) That which is Beyond (them). 37\n\np. 264\n\n38\\. Thou art the Primal Deva, the Ancient Purusha; Thou art the Supreme\nRefuge of this universe, Thou art the Knower, and the One Thing to be known;\nThou art the Supreme Goal. By Thee is the universe pervaded, O Boundless Form.\n\n39\\. Thou art Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, the Moon, Prajapati, and the Great-\nGrandfather. Salutation, salutation\n\np. 265\n\nto Thee, a thousand times, and again and again salutation, salutation to Thee!\n39\n\n40\\. Salutation to Thee before and behind, salutation to Thee on every side, O\nAll! Thou, infinite in power and infinite in prowess, pervadest all; wherefore\nThou art All. 40\n\np. 266\n\n41-42. Whatever I have presumptuously said from carelessness or love,\naddressing Thee as, "O Krishna, O Yadava, O friend," regarding Thee merely as\na friend, unconscious of this Thy greatness--in whatever way I may have been\ndisrespectful to Thee in fun, while walking, reposing, sitting, or at meals,\nwhen alone (with Thee), O Achyuta, or in company--\n\np. 267\n\n[paragraph continues] I implore Thee, Immeasurable One, to forgive all this.\n41\n\n43\\. Thou art the Father of the world, moving and unmoving; the object of its\nworship; greater than the great. None there exists who is equal to Thee in the\nthree worlds; who then can excel Thee, O. Thou of power incomparable? 43\n\np. 268\n\n44\\. So prostrating my body in adoration, I crave Thy forgiveness, Lord\nadorable! As a father forgiveth his son, friend a dear friend, a beloved one\nhis love, even so shouldst Thou forgive me, O Deva.\n\np. 269\n\n45\\. Overjoyed am I to have seen what I saw never before; yet my mind is\ndistracted with terror. Show me, O Deva, only that Form of Thine. Have mercy,\nO Lord of Devas, O Abode of the universe.\n\n46\\. Diademed, bearing a mace and a discus, Thee I desire to see as before.\nAssume that same four-armed Form, O Thou of thousand arms, of universal Form.\n\np. 270\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n47\\. Graciously have I shown to thee, O Arjuna, this Form supreme, by My own\nYoga power, this resplendent, primeval, infinite, universal Form of Mine,\nwhich hath not been seen before by anyone else.\n\n48\\. Neither by the study of the Veda and Yajna, nor by gifts, nor by rituals,\n\np. 271\n\nnor by severe austerities, am I in such Form seen, in the world of men, by any\nother than thee, O great hero of the Kurus.\n\n49\\. Be not afraid nor bewildered, having beheld this Form of Mine, so\nterrific. With thy fears dispelled and with gladdened heart, now see again\nthis (former) form of Mine.\n\np. 272\n\nSanjaya said:\n\n50\\. So Vasudeva, having thus spoken to Arjuna, showed again His own Form and\nthe Great-souled One, assuming His gentle Form, pacified him who was\nterrified.\n\nArjuna said:\n\n51\\. Having seen this Thy gentle human Form, O Janardana, my thoughts are now\ncomposed and I am restored to my nature.\n\np. 273\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n52\\. Very hard indeed it is to see this Form of Mine which thou hast seen.\nEven the Devas ever long to behold this Form.\n\n53\\. Neither by the Vedas, nor by austerity, nor by gifts, nor by sacrifice\ncan I be seen as thou hast seen Me.\n\np. 274\n\n54\\. But by the single-minded devotion I may in this Form, be known, O Arjuna,\nand seen in reality, and also entered into, O scorcher of foes. 54\n\n55\\. He who does work for Me alone and has Me for his goal, is devoted to Me,\nis freed from attachment, and bears enmity towards no creature--he entereth\ninto Me, O Pandava. 55\n\np. 275\n\n\n\nThe end of the eleventh chapter designated, The Vision of the Universal Form.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[242:3](sbg16.htm#fr_245) _Thy Ishvara-Form_ --as possessed of omnipotence,\nomnipresence, infinite wisdom, strength, virtue and splendour.\n\n[244:7](sbg16.htm#fr_246) _Centred in one_ --as part of My body.\n\n_All else_ -- _e.g._ , your success or defeat in the war, about which you\nentertain a doubt (II. 6).\n\n[245:8](sbg16.htm#fr_247) _Me_ --in My Universal Form.\n\n[246:12](sbg16.htm#fr_248) p. 247 _Mighty Being:_ The Universal Form.\n\nThe splendour of the Universal Form excels all others; it is indeed beyond\ncompare.\n\n[247:14](sbg16.htm#fr_249) _Deva:_ God, in His Universal Form.\n\n[253:22](sbg16.htm#fr_250) _Ushmap as_--The Pitris.\n\n[254:25](sbg16.htm#fr_251) _Pralaya-fires:_ The fires which consume the p. 255\nworlds at the time of the final dissolution (Pralaya) of the universe\n\n_I know . . . quarters:_ I cannot distinguish the East from the West, nor the\nNorth from the South.\n\n[256:26](sbg16.htm#fr_252) _Sutaputra:_ The son of a charioteer, Kama.\n\n[257:28](sbg16.htm#fr_253) 28 & 29.--The two similes vividly illustrate how\nthe assembled warriors rush to destruction, out of their uncontrollable\nnature, with or without discrimination.\n\n[258:30](sbg16.htm#fr_254) _Licking Thy lips:_ consuming entirely, enjoying\nit, as it were.\n\n[259:32](sbg16.htm#fr_255) _Even without thee &c_.--Even without thy\ninstrumentality, _i.e._ , even if thou, O Arjuna, wouldst not fight, the end\nof all these warriors is inevitable, because I as the all-destroying Time have\nalready killed them; so thy instrumentality in that work is insignificant.\n\n[260:33](sbg16.htm#fr_256) _Be thou . . . cause_.--People will think thee as\nthe vanquisher of thy enemies, whom even the Devas cannot kill, and thus thou\nwilt gain glory; but thou art only an instrument in My hand.\n\n_Savyas achin_--one who could shoot arrows even with his left hand.\n\n[261:34](sbg16.htm#fr_257) _Already killed by me:_ --so do not be afraid of\nincurring sin by killing Drona, Bhishma and others though they are venerable\nto you as; your Guru, grandsire, etc.\n\n_Distressed with fear_ --as regards success because these great warriors are\nregarded as invincible.\n\n[263:37](sbg16.htm#fr_258) _Brahm a:_ the Hiranyagarbha.\n\n_The Being and the non-Being, &c._--The Sat (manifested) and the Asat\n(unmanifested), which form the Upadhis (adjuncts) of the Akshara\n(Imperishable); as such He is spoken of as the Sat and the Asat.
