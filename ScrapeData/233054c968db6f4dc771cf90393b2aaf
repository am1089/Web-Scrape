And know me also, O descendant of Bharata! to\nbe the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a in all Kshetras. The knowledge of Kshetra and Kshetra\n_g_ \xc3\xb1a is deemed by me (to be real) knowledge. Now hear from me in brief what\nthat Kshetra (is), what (it is) like, what changes (it undergoes), and whence\n(it comes), and what is he 3, and what his powers, (all which) is sung in\nvarious ways by sages in numerous hymns 4, distinctly, and in well-settled\ntexts full of argument, giving indications or full instruction about the\nBrahman. The great elements 5, egoism, the understanding, the unperceived\nalso, the ten senses, and the one, and the five objects of sense, desire,\n\np. 103\n\naversion, pleasure, pain, body, consciousness, courage, thus in brief has been\ndeclared the Kshetra with changes 1. Absence of vanity, absence of\nostentatiousness, absence of hurtfulness, forgiveness, straightforwardness,\ndevotion to a preceptor, purity 2, steadiness, self-restraint, indifference\ntowards objects of sense, and also absence of egoism; perception of the misery\nand evil of birth, death 3, old age, and disease; absence of attachment,\nabsence of self-identifying regard for son, wife 4, home, and so forth; and\nconstant equability on the approach of (both what is) agreeable and (what is)\ndisagreeable; unswerving devotion to me, without meditation on any one else;\nresorting to clean places, distaste for assemblages of men 5, constancy in\nknowledge of the relation of the individual self to the supreme, perception of\nthe object  6 of knowledge of the truth, this is called knowledge; that is\nignorance which is opposed to this. I will declare that which is the object of\nknowledge, knowing which, one reaches immortality; the highest Brahman, having\nno beginning nor end, which cannot be said to be existent or non-existent 7.\nIt has hands and feet on all sides, it has eyes, heads, and faces on all\nsides, it has ears on all sides, it\n\np. 104\n\nstands pervading everything in the world. Possessed of the qualities of all\nthe senses, (but) devoid of all senses 1, unattached, it supports all, is\ndevoid of qualities, and the enjoyer 2 of qualities. It is within all things\nand without them; it is movable and also immovable; it is unknowable through\n(its) subtlety; it stands afar and near 3. Not different in (different) things\n4, but standing as though different, it should be known to be the supporter of\n(all) things, and that which absorbs and creates (them). It is the radiance\neven of the radiant (bodies); it is said (to be) beyond darkness. It is\nknowledge, the object of knowledge, that which is to be attained to by\nknowledge, and placed in the heart of all 5. Thus in brief have Kshetra,\nknowledge, and the object of knowledge been declared. My devotee, knowing\nthis, becomes fit for assimilation with me. Know nature and spirit both (to\nbe) without beginning, and know all developments and qualities 6 (to be)\nproduced from nature. Nature is said to be the origin of the capacity of\nworking (residing) in the body and the senses; and spirit is said (to be) the\norigin of the capacity of enjoying pleasures and\n\np. 105\n\npains 1. For spirit with nature joined, enjoys the qualities born of nature.\nAnd the cause of its birth in good or evil wombs is the connexion with the\nqualities 2. The supreme spirit in this body is called supervisor, adviser 3,\nsupporter, enjoyer, the great lord, and the supreme self also. He who thus\nknows nature and spirit, together with the qualities, is not born again,\nhowever living 4. Some by concentration see the self in the self by the self;\nothers by the Sa _n_ kya-yoga; and others still by the Karma-yoga 5; others\nyet, not knowing this, practise concentration, after hearing from others 6.\nThey, too, being (thus) devoted to hearing (instruction) cross beyond death.\nWhatever thing movable or immovable comes into existence, know that to be from\nthe connexion of Kshetra and Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a, O chief of the descendants of\nBharata! He sees (truly)\n\np. 106\n\nwho sees the supreme lord abiding alike in all entities, and not destroyed\nthough they are destroyed. For he who sees the lord abiding everywhere alike,\ndoes not destroy himself [1](sbe0816.htm#fn_441)by himself, and then reaches\nthe highest goal. He sees (truly), who sees (all) actions (to be) in every way\ndone by nature alone, and likewise the self (to be) not the doer. When a man\nsees all the variety of entities as existing in one [2](sbe0816.htm#fn_442),\nand (all as) emanating from that, then he becomes (one with) the Brahman. This\ninexhaustible supreme self, being without beginning and without qualities,\ndoes not act, and is not tainted, O son of Kunti! though stationed in the\nbody. As by (reason of its) subtlety the all-pervading space is not tainted,\nso the self stationed in every body is not tainted. As the sun singly lights\nup all this world, so the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a, O descendant of Bharata! lights up\nthe whole Kshetra. Those who, with the eye of knowledge, thus understand the\ndifference between Kshetra and Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a, and the destruction of the\nnature of all entities [3](sbe0816.htm#fn_443), go to the supreme.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[102:1](sbe0815.htm#fr_418) I retain the original for want of a good\nequivalent.\n\n[102:2](sbe0815.htm#fr_419) Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vataropanishad, p. 368, and\nMaitri, pp. 25-72.\n\n[102:3](sbe0815.htm#fr_420) I. e. the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a.\n\n[102:4](sbe0815.htm#fr_421) Hymns = scil. from the Vedas about ordinary or\nspecial actions and so forth.

The subtle\nelements, earth, fire, &c., are meant. The unperceived = nature; the one =\nmind; courage = that by which the drooping body and senses are supported;\negoism = self-consciousness-the feeling 'this is I.'\n\n[103:1](sbe0815.htm#fr_423) See the last page. Changes = development.\n\n[103:2](sbe0815.htm#fr_424) Internal as well as external; as to devotion to a\npreceptor, cf. \xc3\x82pastamba, p. 11 (p. 23 in this series); Taittiriya-upanishad,\np. 38; _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 117; and Sutta Nipata, p. 87; as to egoism, see\n[p. 52](sbe0804.htm#page_52) supra.\n\n[103:3](sbe0815.htm#fr_425) Cf.

None of these can be predicated of the Brahman;\nso you cannot apply either of these words to it. Cf. pp.\n[84](sbe0811.htm#page_84), [96](sbe0813.htm#page_96) supra, also _S_ veta _s_\nvatara, p. 346.\n\n[104:1](sbe0815.htm#fr_430) Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 331. He has no ears,\nbut has the quality of hearing, and so forth; unattached = really out of\nrelation to everything, though seeming to be connected with other things\nthrough delusion.\n\n[104:2](sbe0815.htm#fr_431) I. e. he perceives them.\n\n[104:3](sbe0815.htm#fr_432) \xc3\x8e _s_ opanishad, p. 12; Mu _nd_ aka, p. 313.\n\n[104:4](sbe0815.htm#fr_433) Everything being really one. Cf. inter alia, [p.\n124](sbe0820.htm#page_124) infra.

[p. 88](sbe0812.htm#page_88).\n\n[104:6](sbe0815.htm#fr_435) Developments = body, senses, &c. Qualities =\npleasure, pain, &c.; altogether the expression means the body and feelings and\nso forth.\n\n[105:1](sbe0815.htm#fr_436) _S_ ridhara says that 'is said to be' means by\nKapila and others. For the notion that activity is not a function of the soul,\nsee inter alia, [p. 55](sbe0805.htm#page_55) supra. Enjoyment, however, is,\naccording to this passage, the function of the soul, not of nature. See also\nMaitri-upanishad, pp. 107, 108.\n\n[105:2](sbe0815.htm#fr_437) I. e. 'the senses,' says _S_ ridhara; good = gods,\n&c. evil beasts, &c.\n\n[105:3](sbe0815.htm#fr_438) Scil. concerning the operations of the body and\nsenses. Cf. N _ri_ si _m_ ha-tapini, p. 224. He is adviser because, though he\ndoes not interfere, he sees and therefore may be said to sanction the\noperations alluded to. Supporter, i. e. of body &c. in their workings.\n\n[105:4](sbe0815.htm#fr_439) I. e. though he may have transgressed rules.\n\n[105:5](sbe0815.htm#fr_440) Concentration = fixing of the mind exclusively on\nthe soul, the senses being quiescent. 'See the self,' i. e. the soul; 'in the\nself,' i. e. within themselves; 'by the self,' i. e. by the mind. Sa _n_ khya-\nyoga = belief that qualities are distinct from the self, which is only a\npassive spectator of their operations. Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 109. Karma-\nyoga = dedication of actions to the supreme. Cf. as to this the gloss on _S_ a\n_n_ kara's Bhashya on Vedanta-sutra IV, 2, 21.\n\n[105:6](sbe0815.htm#fr_441) Cf. Sutta Nipata, p. 49.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIV](sbe0816.htm)\n\n"
