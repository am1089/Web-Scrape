This (nishkevalya- _s_ astra) becomes perfect as a thousand of B _ri_\nhatis. It is glory (the glorious Brahman, not the absolute Brahman), it is\nIndra. Indra is the lord of all beings. He who thus knows Indra as the lord of\nall beings, departs from this world by loosening the bonds of life 1\\--so said\nMahidasa Aitareya. Having departed he becomes Indra (or Hira _n_ yagarbha) and\nshines in those worlds 2.\n\np. 232\n\n2\\. And with regard to this they say: 'If a man obtains the other world in\nthis form (by meditating on the pra _n_ a, breath, which is the uktha, the\nhymn of the mahavrata), then in what form does he obtain this world\n[1](sbe01221.htm#fn_575)?'\n\n3\\. Here the blood of the woman is a form of Agni (fire); therefore no one\nshould despise it. And the seed of the man is a form of \xc3\x82ditya (sun);\ntherefore no one should despise it. This self (the woman) gives her self\n(skin, blood, and flesh) to that self (fat, bone, and marrow), and that self\n(man) gives his self (fat, bone, and marrow) to this self (skin, blood, and\nflesh). Thus [2](sbe01221.htm#fn_576) these two grow together. In this form\n(belonging to the woman and to fire) he goes to that world (belonging to the\nman and the sun), and in that form (belonging to man and the sun) he goes to\nthis world (belonging to the woman and to fire [3](sbe01221.htm#fn_577)).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[231:1](sbe01220.htm#fr_575) The commentator explains visrasa by 'merging his\nmanhood in the identity with all,' and doing this while still alive. Visras is\nthe gradual loosening of the body, the decay of old age, but here it has the\nmeaning of vairagya rather, the shaking off of all that ties the Self to this\nbody or this life.\n\n[231:2](sbe01220.htm#fr_576) The fourteen worlds in the egg of Brahman. Comm.\nSome hold that he who enters on this path, and becomes deity, does not p. 232\narrive at final liberation. Others, however, show that this identification\nwith the uktha, and through it with the pra _n_ a (breath) and Hira _n_\nyagarbha, is provisional only, and intended to prepare the mind of the\nworshipper for the reception of the highest knowledge of Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 8](sbe01221.htm)\n\n"
