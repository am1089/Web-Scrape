Moreover, they record him in that.\n\nThey (i.e. the Va _g_ asaneyins) speak of him, viz. Vai _s_ vanara who has\nheaven for his head, &c.--i.e. the highest Self--as within that, i.e. the body\nof the devotee, so as to form the abode of the oblation to Pra _n_ a; viz. in\nthe text,'Of that Vai _s_ vanara Self the head is Sute _g_ as,' and so on. The\ncontext is as follows. The clause 'He who meditates on the Vai _s_ vanara Self\nas prade _s_ amatra,' &c. enjoins meditation on the highest Self having the\nthree worlds for its body, i.e. on Vai _s_ vanara. The following clause 'he\neats food in all worlds' teaches that the attaining of Brahman is the reward\nof such meditation. And then the text proceeds to teach the Agnihotra offered\nto Pra _n_ a, which is something subsidiary to the meditation taught. The text\nhere establishes an identity between the members--fire, sun, &c.--of the Vai\n_s_ vanara enjoined as object of meditation (which members\n\np. 295\n\nare called Sute _g_ as, Vi _s_ varupa, &c.), and parts--viz. head, eye,\nbreath, trunk, bladder, feet--of the worshipper's body. 'The head is Sute _g_\nas'--that means: the head of the devotee is (identical with) heaven, which is\nthe head of the highest Self; and so on up to 'the feet,' i.e. the feet of the\ndevotee are identical with the earth, which constitutes the feet of the\nhighest Self, The devotee having thus reflected on the highest Self, which has\nthe three worlds for its body, as present within his own body, thereupon is\ntold to view his own chest, hair, heart, mind and mouth as identical with the\naltar, grass and the other things which are required for the Agnihotra;\nfurther to identify the oblation to Pra _n_ a with the Agnihotra, and by means\nof this Pra _n_ a-agnihotra to win the favour of Vai _s_ vanara, i.e. the\nhighest Self. The final--conclusion then remains that Vai _s_ vanara is none\nother than the highest Self, the supreme Person.--Here terminates the adhikara\n_n_ a of 'Vai _s_ vanara.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Third Pada: 1.
