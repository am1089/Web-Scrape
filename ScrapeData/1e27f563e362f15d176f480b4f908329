Protect the people. Marka hath  \nbeen removed.  \nGods, drinkers of the Man thin, lead thee forward! Invincible  \nart thou.  \n18 Well stored with people and begetting people, with growth  \nof wealth surround the Sacrificer.  \nThe Manthin joined with Heaven and Earth and with the  \nManthin-shining one.  \nExpelled is Marka.
