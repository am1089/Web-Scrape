Hymn to the battle-drum.\n\n1\\. High sounds the voice of the drum, that acts the warrior, the wooden\n(drum), equipped with the skin of the cow. Whetting thy voice, subduing the\nenemy, like a lion sure of victory, do thou loudly thunder against them!  \n2\\. The wooden (instrument) with fastened (covering) has thundered as a lion,\nas a bull roars to the cow that longs to mate. Thou art a bull, thy enemies\nare eunuchs; thou ownest Indra's foesubduing fire!  \n3\\. Like a bull in the herd, full of might, lusty, do thou, O snatcher of\nbooty, roar against them! Pierce with fire the heart of the enemy; with\n-broken ranks the foe shall run and scatter!  \n4\\. In victorious battles raise thy roar! What may be captured, capture; sound\nin many places! Favour, O drum, (our deeds) with thy divine voice; bring to\n(us) with strength the property of the enemy!  \n5\\. When the wife of the enemy hears the voice of the drum, that speaks to a\nfar distance, may she, aroused by the sound, distressed, snatch her son to her\narms, and run, frightened at the clash of arms!  \n6\\. Do thou, O drum, sound the first sound, ring brilliantly over the back of\nthe earth! Open wide thy maw at the enemies host; resound brightly, joyously,\nO drum!  \n7\\. Between this heaven and earth thy noise shall spread, thy sounds shall\nquickly part to every side! Shout thou and thunder with swelling sound; make\nmusic at thy friend's victory, having, (chosen) the good side!  \n8\\. Manipulated with care, its voice shall resound! Make bristle forth the\nweapons of the warriors! Allied to Indra do thou call hither the warriors;\nwith thy friends beat vigorously down the enemies!  \n9\\. A shouting herald, followed by a bold army, spreading news in many places,\nsounding through the village, eager for success, knowing the way, do thou\ndistribute glory to many in the battle!  \n10\\. Desiring advantage, gaining booty, full mighty, thou hast been made keen\nby (my) song, and winnest battles. As the press-stone on the gathering skin\ndances upon the soma-sboots, thus do thou, O drum, lustily dance upon the\nbooty!  \n11\\. A conqueror of enemies, overwhelming, foe-subduing, eager for the fray,\nvictoriously crushing, as a speaker his speech do thou carry forth thy sound;\nsound forth here strength for victory in battle!  \n12\\. Shaking those that are unshaken, hurrying to the strife, a conqueror of\nenemies, an unconquerable leader, protected by Indra, attending to the hosts,\ndo thou that crusheth the hearts of the enemies, quickly go!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 21 Hymn to the battle-drum, the terror of the enemy](av152.htm)\n\n"
