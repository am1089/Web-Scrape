XIV.\n\nDescendants of \xc5\x9aini, of Anamitra, of \xc5\x9awaphalka and Chitraka, of Andhaka. The\nchildren of Devaka and Ugrasena. The descendants of Bhajamana. Children of\n\xc5\x9aura: his son Vasudeva: his daughter Pritha married to Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u: her children\nYudhisht\xcc\x81hira and his brothers; also Karn\xcc\x81a by \xc3\x81ditya. The sons of Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u by\nMadri. Husbands and children of \xc5\x9aura's other daughters. Previous births of\n\xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala.\n\nTHE younger brother of Anamitra was \xc5\x9aini; his son was Satyaka; his son was\nYuyudhana, also known by the name of Satyaki; his son was Asanga; his son was\nTuni 1; his son was Yugandhara 2. These princes were termed \xc5\x9aaineyas.\n\nIn the family of Anamitra, Pri\xc5\x9bni was born; his son was \xc5\x9awaphalka 3, the\nsanctity of whose character has been described: the younger brother of\n\xc5\x9awaphalka was named Chitraka. \xc5\x9awaphalka had by Gandini, besides Akrura,\nUpamadgu, Mridura, \xc5\x9aarimejaya, Giri, Kshatropakshatra, \xc5\x9aatrughna, Arimarddana,\nDharmadhris, Dhrisht\xcc\x81asarman, Gandhamojavaha, and Prativaha. He had also a\ndaughter, Sutara 4.\n\nDevavat and Upadeva were the sons of Akrura. The sons of Chitrika were Prithu\nand Vipritha, and many others 5. Andhaka had four sons, Kukkura, Bhajamana,\n\xc5\x9auchi 6, Kambalavarhish. The son of Kukkura was Vrisht\xcc\x81a 7; his son was\nKapotaroman; his son was Viloman 8;\n\np. 436\n\nhis son was Bhava 9, who was also called Chandanodakadundubhi 10; he was a\nfriend of the Gandharba Tumburu; his son was Abhijit; his son was Punarvasu;\nhis son was \xc3\x81huka, and he had also a daughter named \xc3\x81huki. The sons of \xc3\x81huka\nwere Devaka and Ugrasena. The former had four sons, Devavat, Upadeva, Sudeva,\nand Devarakshita, and seven daughters, Vrikadeva, Upadeva, Devarakshita,\n\xc5\x9arideva, \xc5\x9aantideva, Sahadeva, and Devaki: all the daughters were married to\nVasudeva. The sons of Ugrasena were Kansa, Nyagrodha, Sunaman, Kanka, \xc5\x9aanku,\nSubhumi, Rasht\xcc\x81rapala, Yuddhamusht\xcc\x81hi, and Tusht\xcc\x81imat; and his daughters were\nKansa, Kansavati, Sutanu, Rasht\xcc\x81rapali, and Kanki.\n\nThe son of Bhajamana 11 was Viduratha; his son was \xc5\x9aura; his son was \xc5\x9aamin 12;\nhis son was Pratikshatra 13; his son was Swayambhoja 14; his son was Hridika,\nwho had Kritavarman, \xc5\x9aatadhanu, Devamid\xcc\x81husha, and others 15. \xc5\x9aura, the son of\nDevamid\xcc\x81husha  16, was married to Marisha, and had by her ten sons. On the\nbirth of Vasudeva, who was one of these sons, the gods, to whom the future is\nmanifest, foresaw that the divine being would take a human form in his family,\nand thereupon they sounded with joy the drums of heaven: from this\ncircumstance Vasudeva was also called \xc3\x81nakadunbubhi 17. His brothers were\nDevabhaga, Deva\xc5\x9bravas, Anadhrisht\xcc\x81i, Karundhaka, Vatsabalaka, \xc5\x9arinjaya,\n\np. 437\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc5\x9ayama, \xc5\x9aamika, and Gan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81usha; and his sisters were\nPritha, \xc5\x9arutadeva, \xc5\x9arutakirtti, \xc5\x9aruta\xc5\x9bravas, and Rajadhidevi.\n\n\xc5\x9aura had a friend named Kuntibhoja, to whom, as he had no children, the\npresented in due form his daughter Pritha. She was married to Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u, and\nbore him Yudhisht\xcc\x81hira, Bhima, and Arjuna, who were in fact the sons of the\ndeities Dharma, Vayu (air), and Indra. Whilst she was yet unmarried, also, she\nhad a son named Karn\xcc\x81a, begotten by the divine \xc3\x81ditya (the sun). Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u had\nanother wife, named Madri, who had by the twin sons of \xc3\x81ditya, Nasatya and\nDasra, two sons, Nakula and Sahadeva 18.\n\n\xc5\x9arutadeva was married to the Karusha prince Vriddha\xc5\x9barman, and bore him the\nfierce Asura Dantavaktra. Dhrisht\xcc\x81aketu, raja of Kaikeya 19, married\n\xc5\x9arutakirtti, and had by her Santarddana and four other sons, known as the five\nKaikeyas. Jayasena, king of Avanti, married Rajadhidevi, and had Vinda and\nAnavinda. \xc5\x9aruta\xc5\x9bravas was wedded to Damaghosha, raja of Chedi, and bore him\n\xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala 20. This prince was in a former existence the unrighteous but valiant\nmonarch of the Daityas, Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu, who was killed by the divine guardian\nof creation (in the man-lion Avatara). He was next the ten-headed sovereign\nRavan\xcc\x81a, whose unequalled prowess, strength, and power were overcome by the\nlord of the three worlds, Rama. Having been killed by the deity in the form of\nRaghava, he had long enjoyed the reward of his virtues in exemption from an\nembodied state, but had now received birth once more as \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala, the son of\nDamaghosha, king of Chedi. In this character he renewed, with greater\ninveteracy than ever, his hostile hatred towards the god surnamed\nPun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81arikaksha, a portion of the supreme being, who had descended to lighten\nthe burdens of the earth; and was in consequence slain by him: but from the\ncircumstance of his thoughts being constantly engrossed by the supreme being,\n\xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala was united with him after death; for the lord giveth to those to whom\nhe is favourable whatever they desire, and he bestows a heavenly and exalted\nstation even upon those whom he slays in his displeasure.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[435:1](vp107.htm#fr_1161) Bhuti: Vayu. Kuni: Bhagavata. Dyumni: Matsya.\n\n[435:2](vp107.htm#fr_1162) The Agni makes these all brother's sons of Satyaka,\nand adds another, Rishabha, the father of \xc5\x9awaphalka.\n\n[435:3](vp107.htm#fr_1163) The authorities are not agreed here. \xc5\x9awaphalka,\naccording to the Agni, as just remarked, comes from \xc5\x9aini, the son of Anamitra.\nThe Bhagavata, instead of Pri\xc5\x9bni, has Vrishn\xcc\x81i, son of Anamitra; the Brahma\nand Hari V. have Vrishn\xcc\x81i; and the Agni, Prishn\xcc\x81i, son of Yudhajit. The Matsya\nalso makes Yudhajit the ancestor of Akrura, through Rishabha and Jayanta.\nYudhajit in the Brahma, &c. is the son of Krosht\xcc\x81ri.\n\n[435:4](vp107.htm#fr_1164) The different authorities vary in the reading of\nthese names, though they generally concur in the number.\n\n[435:5](vp107.htm#fr_1165) The Matsya and Padma call them sons of Akrura, but\nno doubt incorrectly.\n\n[435:6](vp107.htm#fr_1166) \xc5\x9aami: Vayu. \xc5\x9aa\xc5\x9bi: Matsya. \xc5\x9aini Agni. This last\nmakes them the sons of Babhru, and calls the first Sundara.\n\n[435:7](vp107.htm#fr_1167) Vrishn\xcc\x81i: Bhagavata, Vayu, Matsya, &c. Dhrisht\xcc\x81a:\nAgni. Dhrishn\xcc\x81u: Brahma, Hari V.\n\n[435:8](vp107.htm#fr_1168) The Bhagavata puts Viloman first. The Linga makes\nit an epithet of Kapotaroman, saying he was Vilomaja, 'irregularly begotten.'\nIn place of Viloman we have Raivata, Vayu; Taittiri, Matsya; Tittiri, Agni.\n\n[436:9](vp107.htm#fr_1169) Nava: Agni. Bala: Linga. Nala: Matsya. Tomas:\nKurma. Anu: Bhagavata.\n\n[436:10](vp107.htm#fr_1170) The Matsya, Vayu, and Agni agree with our text.\nThe Linga, Padma, and Kurma read \xc3\x81nakadundubhi as a synonyme of Bala. The\nBrahma and Hari V. have no such name, but here insert Punarvasu, son of\nTaittiri. The Bhagavata has a different series, or Anu, Andhaka, Dundubhi,\nArijit, Punarvasu, \xc3\x81huka.\n\n[436:11](vp107.htm#fr_1171) This Bhajamana is the son of Andhaka, according to\nall the best authorities; so the Padma calls this branch the \xc3\x81ndhakas. The\nAgni makes him the son of Babhru.\n\n[436:12](vp107.htm#fr_1172) Vata, Nivata, \xc5\x9aamin: Vayu.\n\n[436:13](vp107.htm#fr_1173) Sona\xc5\x9bwa: Matsya. Sonaksha: Padma. \xc5\x9aini: Bhajavata.\n\n[436:14](vp107.htm#fr_1174) Bhojaka: Agni. Bhoja: Padma.\n\n[436:15](vp107.htm#fr_1175) Ten sons: Matsya, &c.\n\n[436:16](vp107.htm#fr_1176) Devarha: Vayu, Padma, Agni, and Matsya; and a\ndifferent series follows, or Kambalavarhish, Asamaujas, Samaujas, Sudanstra,\nSuva\xc5\x9ba, Dhrisht\xcc\x81a, Anamitra, Nighna, Satrajit. They all make Vasudeva the son\nof \xc5\x9aura, however; but the three first leave it doubtful whether that \xc5\x9aura was\nthe son of Bhajamana or not. The Bhagavata and Brahma agree with the text,\nwhich is probably correct. The Brahma has \xc5\x9aura son of Devamid\xcc\x81hush, although\nit does not specify the latter amongst the sons of Hridika.\n\n[436:17](vp107.htm#fr_1177) \xc3\x81naka a larger, and Dundubhi a smaller drum.\n\n[437:18](vp107.htm#fr_1178) The Mahabharata is the best authority for these\ncircumstances.\n\n[437:19](vp107.htm#fr_1179) The Padma calls him king of Kashmir.\n\n[437:20](vp107.htm#fr_1180) The Brahma P. and Hari V. make \xc5\x9arutadeva mother of\n\xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala, and Prithukirtti of Dantavaktra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XV](vp108.htm)\n\n"
