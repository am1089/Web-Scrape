And because Brahman is called the source.\n\nBrahman is the material cause for that reason also that it is spoken of in the\nsacred texts as the source (yoni); compare, for instance, 'The maker, the\nLord, the person who has his source in Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, i, 3); and 'That\nwhich the wise regard as the source of all beings' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 6). For that\nthe word 'source' denotes the material cause is well known from the use of\nordinary language; the earth, for instance, is called the yoni of trees and\nherbs. In some places indeed the word yoni means not source, but merely place;\nso, for instance, in the mantra, 'A yoni, O Indra, was made for you to sit\ndown upon' ( _Ri_ k. Sa _m_ h. I, 104, 1). But that in the passage quoted it\nmeans 'source' follows from a complementary passage, 'As the spider sends\nforth and draws in its threads,' &c.--It is thus proved that Brahman is the\nmaterial cause of the world.--Of the objection, finally, that in ordinary life\nthe activity of operative causal agents only, such as potters and the like, is\npreceded by reflection, we dispose by the remark that, as the matter in hand\nis not one which can be known through inferential reasoning, ordinary\nexperience cannot be used to settle it. For the knowledge of that matter we\nrather depend on Scripture altogether, and hence Scripture only has to be\nappealed to. And that Scripture teaches that the Lord who reflects before\ncreation is at the same time the material cause, we have already explained.\nThe subject will, moreover, be discussed more fully later on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 28](sbe34139.htm)\n\n"
