I could see at once that\nshe had been unsuccessful with Nikhil. She had been so proudly confident that\nshe would have her own way--but I had never shared her confidence. Woman knows\nman well enough where he is weak, but she is quite unable to fathom him where\nhe is strong. The fact is that man is as much a mystery to woman as woman is\nto man. If that were not so, the separation of the sexes would only have been\na waste of Nature\'s energy.\n\nAh pride, pride! The trouble was, not that the necessary thing had failed of\naccomplishment, but that the entreaty, which had cost her such a struggle to\nmake, should have been refused. What a wealth of colour and movement,\nsuggestion and deception, group themselves round this "me" and "mine" in\nwoman. That is just where her beauty lies--she is ever so much more personal\nthan man. When man was being made, the Creator was a schoolmaster-- His bag\nfull of commandments and principles; but when He came to woman, He resigned\nHis headmastership and turned artist, with only His brush and paint-box.\n\nWhen Bimala stood silently there, flushed and tearful in her broken pride,\nlike a storm-cloud, laden with rain and charged with lightning, lowering over\nthe horizon, she looked so absolutely sweet that I had to go right up to her\nand take her by the hand. It was trembling, but she did not snatch it away.\n"Bee," said I, "we two are colleagues, for our aims are one. Let us sit down\nand talk it over."\n\nI led her, unresisting, to a seat. But strange! at that very point the rush of\nmy impetuosity suffered an unaccountable check-- just as the current of the\nmighty Padma, roaring on in its irresistible course, all of a sudden gets\nturned away from the bank it is crumbling by some trifling obstacle beneath\nthe surface. When I pressed Bimala\'s hand my nerves rang music, like tuned-up\nstrings; but the symphony stopped short at the first movement.\n\nWhat stood in the way? Nothing singly; it was a tangle of a multitude of\nthings--nothing definitely palpable, but only that unaccountable sense of\nobstruction. Anyhow, this much has become plain to me, that I cannot swear to\nwhat I really am. It is because I am such a mystery to my own mind that my\nattraction for myself is so strong! If once the whole of myself should become\nknown to me, I would then fling it all away--and reach beatitude!\n\nAs she sat down, Bimala went ashy pale. She, too, must have realized what a\ncrisis had come and gone, leaving her unscathed. The comet had passed by, but\nthe brush of its burning tail had overcome her. To help her to recover herself\nI said: "Obstacles there will be, but let us fight them through, and not be\ndown-hearted. Is not that best, Queen?"\n\nBimala cleared her throat with a little cough, but simply to murmur: "Yes."\n\n"Let us sketch out our plan of action," I continued, as I drew a piece of\npaper and a pencil from my pocket.\n\nI began to make a list of the workers who had joined us from Calcutta and to\nassign their duties to each. Bimala interrupted me before I was through,\nsaying wearily: "Leave it now; I will join you again this evening" and then\nshe hurried out of the room. It was evident she was not in a state to attend\nto anything. She must be alone with herself for a while--perhaps lie down on\nher bed and have a good cry!\n\nWhen she left me, my intoxication began to deepen, as the cloud colours grow\nricher after the sun is down. I felt I had let the moment of moments slip by.\nWhat an awful coward I had been! She must have left me in sheer disgust at my\nqualms--and she was right!\n\nWhile I was tingling all over with these reflections, a servant came in and\nannounced Amulya, one of our boys. I felt like sending him away for the time,\nbut he stepped in before I could make up my mind. Then we fell to discussing\nthe news of the fights which were raging in different quarters over cloth and\nsugar and salt; and the air was soon clear of all fumes of intoxication. I\nfelt as if awakened from a dream. I leapt to my feet feeling quite ready for\nthe fray--Bande Mataram!\n\nThe news was various. Most of the traders who were tenants of Harish Kundu had\ncome over to us. Many of Nikhil\'s officials were also secretly on our side,\npulling the wires in our interest. The Marwari shopkeepers were offering to\npay a penalty, if only allowed to clear their present stocks. Only some\nMahomedan traders were still obdurate.\n\nOne of them was taking home some German-made shawls for his family. These were\nconfiscated and burnt by one of our village boys. This had given rise to\ntrouble. We offered to buy him Indian woollen stuffs in their place. But where\nwere cheap Indian woollens to be had? We could not very well indulge him in\nCashmere shawls! He came and complained to Nikhil, who advised him to go to\nlaw. Of course Nikhil\'s men saw to it that the trial should come to nothing,\neven his law-agent being on our side!\n\nThe point is, if we have to replace burnt foreign clothes with Indian cloth\nevery time, and on the top of that fight through a law-suit, where is the\nmoney to come from? And the beauty of it is that this destruction of foreign\ngoods is increasing their demand and sending up the foreigner\'s profits--very\nlike what happened to the fortunate shopkeeper whose chandeliers the nabob\ndelighted in smashing, tickled by the tinkle of the breaking glass.\n\nThe next problem is--since there is no such thing as cheap and gaudy Indian\nwoollen stuff, should we be rigorous in our boycott of foreign flannels and\nmemos, or make an exception in their favour?\n\n"Look here!" said I at length on the first point, "we are not going to keep on\nmaking presents of Indian stuff to those who have got their foreign purchases\nconfiscated. The penalty is intended to fall on them, not on us. If they go to\nlaw, we must retaliate by burning down their granaries!--What startles you,\nAmulya? It is not the prospect of a grand illumination that delights me! You\nmust remember, this is War. If you are afraid of causing suffering, go in for\nlove-making, you will never do for this work!"\n\nThe second problem I solved by deciding to allow no compromise with foreign\narticles, in any circumstance whatever. In the good old days, when these gaily\ncoloured foreign shawls were unknown, our peasantry used to manage well enough\nwith plain cotton quilts--they must learn to do so again. They may not look as\ngorgeous, but this is not the time to think of looks.\n\nMost of the boatmen had been won over to refuse to carry foreign goods, but\nthe chief of them, Mirjan, was still insubordinate.\n\n"Could you not get his boat sunk?" I asked our manager here.\n\n"Nothing easier, sir," he replied. "But what if afterwards I am held\nresponsible?"\n\n"Why be so clumsy as to leave any loophole for responsibility? However, if\nthere must be any, my shoulders will be there to bear it."\n\nMirjan\'s boat was tied near the landing-place after its freight had been taken\nover to the market-place. There was no one on it, for the manager had arranged\nfor some entertainment to which all had been invited. After dusk the boat,\nloaded with rubbish, was holed and set adrift. It sank in mid-stream.\n\nMirjan understood the whole thing. He came to me in tears to beg for mercy. "I\nwas wrong, sir--" he began.\n\n"What makes you realize that all of a sudden?" I sneered.\n\nHe made no direct reply. "The boat was worth two thousand rupees," he said. "I\nnow see my mistake, and if excused this time I will never ..." with which he\nthrew himself at my feet.\n\nI asked him to come ten days later. If only we could pay him that two thousand\nrupees at once, we could buy him up body and soul. This is just the sort of\nman who could render us immense service, if won over. We shall never be able\nto make any headway unless we can lay our hands on plenty of money.\n\nAs soon as Bimala came into the sitting-room, in the evening, I said as I rose\nup to receive her: "Queen! Everything is ready, success is at hand, but we\nmust have money.\n\n"Money? How much money?"\n\n"Not so very much, but by hook or by crook we must have it!"\n\n"But how much?"\n\n"A mere fifty thousand rupees will do for the present."\n\nBimala blenched inwardly at the figure, but tried not to show it. How could\nshe again admit defeat?\n\n"Queen!" said I, "you only can make the impossible possible. Indeed you have\nalready done so. Oh, that I could show you the extent of your achievement--\nthen you would know it. But the time for that is not now. Now we want money!"\n\n"You shall have it," she said.\n\nI could see that the thought of selling her jewels had occurred to her. So I\nsaid: "Your jewels must remain in reserve. One can never tell when they may be\nwanted." And then, as Bimala stared blankly at me in silence, I went on: "This\nmoney must come from your husband\'s treasury."\n\nBimala was still more taken aback. After a long pause she said: "But how am I\nto get his money?"\n\n"Is not his money yours as well?"\n\n"Ah, no!" she said, her wounded pride hurt afresh.\n\n"If not," I cried, "neither is it his, but his country\'s, whom he has deprived\nof it, in her time of need!"\n\n"But how am I to get it?" she repeated.\n\n"Get it you shall and must. You know best how. You must get it for Her to whom\nit rightfully belongs. _Bande Mataram_! These are the magic words which will\nopen the door of his iron safe, break through the walls of his strong-room,\nand confound the hearts of those who are disloyal to its call. Say _Bande\nMataram_ , Bee!"\n\n" _Bande Mataram_!"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII](hw29.htm)\n\n'
