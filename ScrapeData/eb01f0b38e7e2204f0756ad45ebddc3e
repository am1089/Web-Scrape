His life on earth began on\nthe 20th of February, 1833, and ended the 16th of August, 1886, 1 a.m. 1 The\nvillage in which he was born was inhabited chiefly by people of the lower\ncastes, mostly blacksmiths, Karmakars, or in familiar abbreviation, Kamars,\nand hence called Kamarpukar, with some sprinkling of carpenters, cowherds\n(Gowalas), husbandmen (Kaivartas), and oilmen (Telis). His father was the head\n\np. 31\n\nof the only Brahmanic family settled in the village. Though very poor, he\nwould rather starve than stray from the strictest path of Brahmanical\northodoxy. The original name given to his child was Gadadhara, a name of Vish\n_n_ u, which means one who holds the club, and it was given him, we are told,\non account of a prophetic dream of his father, to whom, while on a pilgrimage\nto Gya, Vish _n_ u appeared, telling him that he, the deity, would be born as\nhis son. It was later in life that he began to be called Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a.\nWe are told, and we could hardly have expected anything else, that his father,\nwhose name was Khudiram Chattopadhyaya, was a great lover of God, a man pure\nin mind, handsome of figure, straightforward and independent. Rumour says--and\nwhat is rumour but another name for the Dialogic Process of which we spoke--\nthat he possessed supernatural powers, particularly what is called Vak-siddhi,\npower of speech, which means that everything he told, good or bad, of anybody,\nwould always come to pass. He was highly reverenced by all the people of his\nvillage, who stood up whenever they saw him coming, and saluted him, nay who\nwould never talk frivolity in his presence.\n\nIt could hardly have been otherwise than that his mother also, Chandrama _n_ i\nDevi, was a pattern of simplicity and kindness. We are told that Mathura Nath,\nthe rich and devoted disciple of her son, came to her once and pressed her to\naccept a present of a few thousand rupees, but to his astonishment she\ndeclined the offer.\n\nThe father proved his independence while still living at\n\np. 32\n\n[paragraph continues] Dere, on his own ancestral property. The Zemindar of the\nvillage wanted him to appear as a witness on his side, threatening him with\nconfiscation of his property and expulsion from his village, if he refused.\nKhudiram refused, left his village, and migrated to Kamarpur, a village two or\nthree miles east of Dere. There, through the help of some true friends, he\nmanaged to make a poor living, and yet he was always profusely generous to the\npoor and hospitable to everybody, living chiefly in the company of religious\nmen, performing every kind of worship, and trying to realise religion to its\nfullest extent.\n\nThere is a story that Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a\'s father was going to pay a visit to\nhis daughter one day, some twelve or fourteen miles from the place where he\nlived. After travelling more than half the way, he came across a Bel-tree,\nbeautifully covered with new-grown green leaves. These leaves are very sacred\nto a Hindu, and they, use them in worshipping the god _S_ iva. It was spring-\ntime. The Bel-trees were casting off their old leaves, and the man had not\nrecently been able to find any good leaves to offer to _S_ iva. On finding\nthese, he at once climbed up the tree, gathered as many leaves as he could\ncarry, and returned home to worship _S_ iva, without going to see his\ndaughter. He was a great lover of Rama, and his tutelary deity was the pure\nand divine _S_ ri Rama _k_ andra. He had a little plot of land outside the\nvillage, and in the sowing time, after getting a man to plough the field, he\nwould go himself, put a few grains of rice in the name of Raghuvira on the\nground first, and then order the labourers to finish\n\np. 33\n\nthe work. It is said that that little plot of land produced enough, as long as\nhe lived, to maintain the whole of the family. He ever depended upon his\nRaghuvira, or the hero of the race of Raghu, the divine Rama, and never cared\nfor the morrow. His son Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, we are told, had something in him\nwhich attracted everybody and made people love him, as if he were of their own\nkith and kin, even at the first appearance.\n\nThe young child used to repeat the whole of the religious operas and dramas,\nthe acting, the music, and everything, after hearing them once. He had a very\ngood musical voice and a taste for music. He was a very good judge of the\nmerits and defects of the statues or images of gods or goddesses, and his\njudgment was held as final by the old people of the village, even from his\nchildhood. He could draw and make images of gods himself. One of the broken\nstone images of _S_ ri K _ri_ sh _n_ a, which he repaired in later days, is\nstill to be seen in the temple of Dakshi _n_ e _s_ vara of Rani Rasmoni, about\nfour miles to the north of Calcutta. After hearing a religious drama, e. g.\nthe doings of _S_ ri K _ri_ sh _n_ a, he would gather his playmates, teach\nthem the different parts, and enact it in the fields, under the trees.\nSometimes he would build an image of the god _S_ iva, and worship it with his\ncompanions. At the age of six he was well versed in the Pura _n_ as, likewise\nin the Ramaya _n_ a, the Mahabharata, and the _S_ rimad Bhagavata, by hearing\nthem from the Ka _th_ aks, a class of men who preach and read these Pura _n_\nas for the enlightenment of the uneducated masses all over India. (His\nknowledge of\n\np. 34\n\nthe Pura _n_ as, the Mahabharata, the Ramaya _n_ a, and the Bhagavata must\nhave been in Bengali, as he never, according to Mozoomdar, who was his friend,\nknew a word of Sanskrit.)\n\nThe pilgrim road to Puri passes through the outskirts of the village where he\nlived, and very often a whole host of ascetics and religious men would come\nand take shelter in the Dharmasala or pilgrim-house, built by the Laha family,\nthe Zemindar of the village. Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a used to go there very often,\ntalk to them on religious subjects, mark their habits, and hear their tales of\ntravel.\n\nIt is the custom in India to gather all the learned pandits or professors of\nthe neighbourhood at a funeral ceremony. In one of these gatherings in the\nhouse of the Laha family, a question arose about some intricate points of\ntheology, and the professors could not come to a conclusion. The boy Ramak\n_ri_ sh _n_ a went to them and decided it quickly with his simple language,\nand all present were astonished. (This might be taken from any _Evangelium\ninfantiae_.)\n\nBefore he reached his teens, he was walking in the fields one day. The sky was\nvery clear and blue, and he saw a flight of white cranes moving along it. The\ncontrast of colours was so very beautiful and dazzling to his imagination, and\nproduced such thoughts in him, that he fell down in a trance. (This would\nadmit of a very natural pathological explanation, and may therefore be\nperfectly true, though it would easily lend itself to further poetical\nexpansion.)\n\nHe was the youngest child of a family of three sons and two daughters. His\neldest brother, Ramkumar Chattopadhyaya,\n\np. 35\n\nwas a very learned professor of the old school. He had his own school at\nCalcutta. At the age of sixteen Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, having been invested by\nhis own father with the sacred Brahmanic thread, was taken to this school, but\nwhat was his disgust to find that after all their high talk on being and non-\nbeing, on Brahman and Maya, on how the soul is liberated by the realisation of\n\xc3\x82tman, they would never dream of practising these precepts in their own lives,\nbut run after lust and gold, after name and fame. He told his brother plainly\nhe would never care for that kind of learning, the sole aim of which was to\ngain a few pieces of silver, or a few maunds of rice and vegetables. He\nyearned to learn something which would raise him above all these, and give him\nas a recompense God Himself. From that time he kept aloof from the school.\n\nThe temple of the goddess Kali at Dakshi _n_ e _s_ vara, about five miles to\nthe north of Calcutta, was established in 1853 A.D. It stands on the side of\nthe Ganges, and is one of the finest temples in India. The temple deeds were\ndrawn in the name of the Guru, or spiritual director of Rani Rasmoni, for she\nbeing of a lower caste, none of the higher castes would come to the temple and\ntake food there if she drew the deeds in her own name. The eldest brother of\n_S_ ri Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a was appointed as priest to the temple. The two\nbrothers came on the day when the temple was first opened and established, but\nsuch were the caste prejudices of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a at that time that he\nprotested vehemently against his brother\'s taking service under a _S_ udra\nwoman, or one of the lowest caste, and would not take any cooked food in\n\np. 36\n\nthe temple precincts, because it was forbidden in the _S_ astras. So, amidst\nall the rejoicings of the day, in which some fifteen to twenty thousand people\nwere sumptuously entertained, he was the only man who kept his fast. At night\nhe went to the grocer\'s close by, took a pice-worth of fried paddy, and\nreturned to Calcutta. But after a week his love for his brother made him\nreturn again, and at his entreaty he consented to live there, on condition,\nhowever, that he should be allowed to cook his own meals by the side of the\nGanges, which is the holiest place according to the Hindus. A few months\nafterwards his brother became incapable of conducting the services through\nillness, and requested Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a to take charge of the duties. He\nconsented at last, and became a recognised worshipper of the goddess Kali.\n\nSincere as he always was, he could do nothing from mercenary motives, nor did\nhe ever do anything which he did not \'thoroughly believe. He now began to look\nupon the image of the goddess Kali as his mother and the mother of the\nuniverse. He believed it to be living and breathing and taking food out of his\nhand. After the regular forms of worship he would sit there for hours and\nhours, singing hymns and talking and praying to her as a child to his mother,\ntill he lost all consciousness of the outward world. Sometimes he would weep\nfor hours, and would not be comforted, because he could not see his mother as\nperfectly as he wished. People became divided in their opinions regarding him.\nSome held the young priest to be mad, and some took him to be a great lover of\nGod, and all this\n\np. 37\n\noutward madness as the manifestation of that love. His mother and brothers,\nthinking that his imagination would calm down when he had a young wife and a\nfamily of his own to look after, took him to his native village and married\nhim to the daughter of Rama Chandra Mukhopadhyaya, who was then five years of\nage, _S_ rimati Saroda Devi or Saradamani Devi by name. It is said when his\nmother and brothers were looking after a suitable bride for him, he himself\ntold them that the daughter of such and such a man was destined to be joined\nto him in marriage, and that she was endowed with all the qualities of a\ngoddess or Devi, and they went and found the bride.\n\nHe used to hold that some women were born with all the qualities of a Devi,\nand some with the opposite qualities--the \xc3\x82suri, or the demoniacal. The former\nwould help their husbands in becoming religious, and would never lead them to\nlust and sensuality, and he could distinguish them by their mere appearance. A\nwoman, a perfect stranger to him, came to see him once at Dakshi _n_ e _s_\nvara many years afterwards. She was of a noble family, the wife of a\ngentleman, and mother of five or six children, yet looked still very young and\nbeautiful. Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a told his disciples at once that she had the\nqualities of a Devi in her, and he would prove it to them. He ordered them to\nburn some incense before her, and taking some flowers, placed them on her feet\nand addressed her as \'mother.\' And the lady who never knew anything before of\nmeditation, or Samadhi, and had never seen him before, fell into a deep trance\nwith her hands lifted as in the act of blessing. That trance did not\n\np. 38\n\nleave her for some hours, and he got frightened at the thought that her\nhusband would accuse him of some black magic. He began, therefore, to pray to\nhis mother Kali (the goddess) to bring her back to her senses. By-and-by she\ncame to herself, and when she opened her eyes they were quite red, and she\nlooked as if she were quite drunk. Her attendants had to support her while she\ngot into a carriage, then she drove back home. This is one of many instances\nof the same kind (evidently cases of hypnosis).\n\nOf men he used to tell the same. In his later days, when crowds of men and\nboys came to him to learn, he would select and point out some who, he said,\nwould realise religion in this life, and of the rest he would say that they\nmust enjoy life a little longer before they would have a sincere desire for\nreligion. He used to say, \'That man who had been an emperor in his former\nbirth, who had enjoyed the highest pleasures the world can give, and who had\nseen the vanities of them all, would attain to perfection in this life on\nearth.\'\n\nAfter his marriage he returned to Calcutta and took upon himself the charges\nof the temple again, but instead of toning down, his fervour and devotion\nincreased a thousand-fold. His whole soul, as it were, melted into one flood\nof tears, and he appealed to the goddess to have mercy on him and reveal\nherself to him. No mother ever shed such burning tears over the death-bed of\nher only child. Crowds assembled round him and tried to console him, when the\nblowing of the conch-shells proclaimed the death of another day, and he gave\nvent to his sorrow, saying, \'Mother, oh my\n\np. 39\n\nmother, another day has gone, and still I have not found thee.\' People thought\nhe was mad, or that he was suffering from some acute pain, for how was it\npossible for them, devoted as they were to lust and gold, to name and fame, to\nimagine that a man could love his God or Goddess Mother with as much intensity\nas they loved their wives and children? The son-in-law of Rani Rasmoni, Babu\nMathuranath, who had always had a love for this young Brahman took him to the\nbest physicians in Calcutta to get him cured of his madness. But all their\nskill was of no avail. Only one physician of Dacca told them that this man was\na great Yogin or ascetic, and that all their pharmacopoeia was useless for\ncuring his disease, if indeed it were a disease at all. So his friends gave\nhim up as lost.\n\nMeanwhile he increased in love and devotion day by day. One day as he was\nfeeling his separation from Devi very keenly, and thinking of putting an end\nto himself; as he could not bear his loneliness any longer, he lost all\noutward sensation, and saw his mother (Kali) in a vision. These visions came\nto him again and again, and then he became calmer. Sometimes he doubted\nwhether these visions were really true, and then he would say, \'I would\nbelieve them true, if such and such a thing happened,\' and it would invariably\nhappen, even at the very hour he expected. For instance, he said one day, \'I\ncould believe them true, and not resulting from a disease of my brain, if the\ntwo young daughters of Rani Rasmoni, who never once came to this temple, would\ncome under the big banyan-tree this afternoon, and would speak to me,\' though\nhe was\n\np. 40\n\na perfect stranger to them. And what was his astonishment when he saw them\nstanding under the tree at the exact hour, and calling him by name, and\ntelling him to be consoled, for the Mother Kali would surely have mercy on\nhim. These ladies of the Zenana had never come to a public place, especially\nwhen young, but somehow or other they got a strong desire to see that temple\nthat very day, and they got permission to go there.\n\nThese visions grew more and more, and his trances became longer and longer in\nduration, till every one saw it was no longer possible for him to perform his\ndaily course of duties. For instance, it is prescribed in the _S_ astras that\na man should put a flower over his own head and think of himself as the very\ngod or goddess he is going to worship, and Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, as he put the\nflower, and thought himself as identified with his mother, would get\nentranced, and would remain in that state for hours. Then again, from time to\ntime, he would entirely lose his own identity, so much so as to appropriate to\nhimself the offerings brought for the goddess. Sometimes forgetting to adorn\nthe image, he would adorn himself with the flowers. Mathuranath at first\nobjected to this, but shortly after-wards, it is said, he saw the body of\nRamak _ri_ sh _n_ a transfigured into that of the god _S_ iva, and from that\nday forward he looked upon him as God Himself, and addressed him always as\nFather whenever he spoke to him. He appointed the nephew of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_\na to conduct the regular services, and left him free to do whatever he liked.\n\np. 41\n\nThe ardent soul of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a could not remain quiet with these\nfrequent visions, but ran eagerly to attain perfection and realisation of God\nin all His different aspects. He thus began the twelve years of unheard-of\ntapasya, or ascetic exercises. Looking back to these years of self-torture in\nhis later days, he said, \'that a great religious tornado, as it were, raged\nwithin him during these years and made everything topsy-turvy.\' He had no idea\nthen that it lasted for so long a time. He never had a wink of sound sleep\nduring these years, could not even doze, but his eyes would remain always open\nand fixed. He thought some-times that he was seriously ill, and holding a\nlooking-glass before him, he put his finger within the sockets of the eye,\nthat the lids might close, but they would not. In his despair he cried out,\n\'Mother, oh! my mother, is this the result of calling upon thee and believing\nin thee?\' And anon a sweet voice would come, and a sweeter smiling face, and\nsaid, \'My son! how could you hope to realise the highest truth, if you don\'t\ngive up the love of your body and of your little self?\' \'A torrent of\nspiritual light,\' he said, \'would come then, deluging my mind and urging me\nforward. I used to tell my mother, "Mother! I could never learn from these\nerring men; but I will learn from thee, and thee alone," and the same voice\nwould say, "Yea, my son!"\' \'I did not once,\' he continued, \'look to the\npreservation of my body. My hair grew till it became matted, and I had no idea\nof it. My nephew, H _ri_ daya, used to bring me some food daily, and some days\nsucceeded and some days did not succeed in forcing a few mouthfuls\n\np. 42\n\ndown my throat, though I had no idea of it. Sometimes I used to go to the\ncloset of the servants and sweepers and clean it with my own hands, and\nprayed, "Mother! destroy in me all idea that I am great, and that I am a\nBrahman, and that they are low and pariahs, for who are they but Thou in so\nmany forms?"\'\n\n\'Sometimes,\' he said, \'I would sit by the Ganges, with some gold and silver\ncoins and a heap of rubbish by my side, and taking some coins in my right hand\nand a handful of rubbish in the left, I would tell my soul, "My soul! this is\nwhat the world calls money, impressed with the queen\'s face. It has the power\nof bringing you rice and vegetables, of feeding the poor, of building houses,\nand doing all that the world calls great, but it can never help thee to\nrealise the ever-existent knowledge and bliss, the Brahman. Regard it,\ntherefore, as rubbish." Then mixing the coins and the rubbish in my hands,\nwhile repeating all the time, "money is rubbish, money is rubbish," I lost all\nperception of difference between the two in my mind, and threw them both into\nthe Ganges. No wonder people took me for mad.\' About this time Mathuranatha,\nwho was very devoted to him, one day put a shawl fringed with gold round him,\nwhich cost about 1,500 Rs. At first he seemed to be pleased with it. But what\nwas the astonishment of Mathuranatha when the next moment Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a\nthrew it on the ground, trampled and spat on it, and began to cleanse the\nfloor of the room with it, saying, \'It increases vanity, but it can never help\nto realise the ever-existent knowledge and bliss\n\np. 43\n\n[paragraph continues] (Sat- _k_ it-ananda), and therefore is no better than a\npiece of torn rag.\'\n\n\'About this time,\' he said, \'I felt such a burning sensation all over my body;\nI used to stand in the waters of the Ganges, with my body immersed up to the\nshoulders and a wet towel over my head all through the day, for it was\ninsufferable. Then a Brahman lady came and cured me of it in three days. She\nsmeared my body with sandal-wood paste and put garlands on my neck, and the\npain vanished in three days.\'\n\nNow this Brahman lady was, we are told, an extraordinary Bengali woman. She\nwas versed in the philosophies and mythologies of India, and could recite book\nafter book from memory. She could hold her ground in argument with the best\npandits of the country. Tall and graceful, she combined in herself all the\nphysical and intellectual qualities that would raise any man or woman high\nabove ordinary mortals. She had a fine voice and was well versed in music. She\nhad given up the world, practised Yoga (ascetics), attained to some wonderful\nYogic powers, and was roaming all over India in the red garb of a Sa _m_\nnyasin. Nobody knew anything of her birth or family or name even, and nobody\ncould induce her to say anything about them. She was as if some goddess had\ncome to this earth to help men to perfection, moved by the sorrows and sins of\nthis wicked world. She seemed to have known full well that she was destined to\nhelp three particular personages, who were very advanced in attaining\nperfection. Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a had been informed by his divine\n\np. 44\n\nmother that she would come and teach him the certain way to attain perfection.\nHe recognised her at once, and she recognised him and said, \'I have found out\nthe other two, and have been searching for thee for a long, long time, and to-\nday I have found thee.\' Up to this time Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a had not found a\nsingle soul who could understand his superhuman devotion and perfect purity,\nand the arrival of this woman was therefore a great relief to him. His\ndevotion and love knew no bounds.\n\nAll people were astonished at the wonderful learning of this Brahman lady, but\nthey could not understand how she could sympathise and place even above\nherself this half-crazed Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a they took him for. To prove that\nhe was not mad, the lady mentioned some Vaish _n_ ava scriptures, got the\nmanuscripts from some learned pandits, and quoted passage after passage,\nshowing that all these physical manifestations come to an ardent lover of God.\nIt was recorded in these books that all these states physical and mental did\nhappen to the great religious reformer of Bengal, _S_ ri Chaitanya, four\nhundred years back, and the remedies were given, too, by which he overcame\nthem. For instance, this burning sensation, as if all the body were in flames,\nfrom which _S_ ri Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a was suffering at the time, was mentioned\nin these Vaish _n_ ava scriptures as having happened to the shepherdess of\nBraja, to the stainless _S_ ri Radha, the beloved of K _ri_ sh _n_ a,\ncenturies before, and again in later times to _S_ ri Chaitanya, when both of\nthem felt deeply the pain of separation from their beloved (God). In both\nthese cases relief came by smearing the body with sandalwood\n\np. 45\n\npaste and wearing garlands of sweet-scented flowers. The lady held it to be no\nreal disease, but a state of physical disturbance, which would come to all who\narrive at that stage of Bhakti, or love of God. She applied the same remedies\nfor three days, and the trouble passed away.\n\nAt another time during her stay he suffered much from an insatiable appetite.\nHowever much he might eat, the appetite was there, preying upon him as if he\nhad taken nothing. The Brahman lady assured him that the same had happened to\nChaitanya and other Yogins, and ordered all sorts of dishes to be put into his\nroom on every side, day and night. This practice was continued for a few days,\nand the sight of so much food gradually acted upon the mind, and the false\nsensation passed away.\n\nThe lady lived there for some years, and made her friend practise all the\ndifferent sorts of Yoga which make a man complete master of his body and mind,\nrender his passions subservient to his reason, and produce a thorough and deep\nconcentration of thought, and, above all, the fearless and unbiased\ndisposition which is essential to everybody who desires to know the truth and\nthe whole truth.\n\nAbout this time Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a began to practise Yoga, or the physical\ndiscipline, which makes the body strong and enduring. He began by regulating\nhis breath, and went through the eight-fold methods prescribed by Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_\nali. His teachers were astonished at the short time in which he came to the\nrealisation and attained the end of all these ascetic practices. One night,\nwhen he was practising Yoga, he was very much frightened at two strings of\nclotted blood\n\np. 46\n\ncoming out of his mouth. The temple services were then in the hands of one of\nhis cousins, Haladhari, a man of great learning and purity and possessed of\ncertain psychical powers, such as Vak-siddhi, power of speech. A few days\nbefore, Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a had offended him by pointing out to him certain\ndefects of his character, so much so that his cousin cursed him and said that\nblood should come out of his mouth. So Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a was frightened, but\na great Yogin who was living there at the time came to his help, and after\ninquiring into his case assured him that it was very good that the blood had\ncome out that way. It was because he had to teach many men, and to do good to\nthem, that he was not permitted to enter into that Samadhi (trance) from which\nnobody returns. He explained to him that when a man has attained to the\nperfection of this Yoga his blood rushes to his brain, and he becomes absorbed\nin Samadhi, perceives his identity with the Supreme Self, and never returns\nany more to speak of his religious experiences to others. Only a few returned,\nnamely, those who by the will of God were born to be the great teachers of\nmankind. In their case the blood rushes to the brain, and they feel the\nidentity for some time, but after that the blood flows out again and they are\nable to teach.\n\nBy this time Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a had learnt all that the Brahman lady could\nteach, but he was still hankering after higher truths, when a _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ anin (a\ntrue philosopher) came and initiated him into the truths of the Vedanta. This\nwas a Sa _m_ nyasin named Tota-puri, tall, muscular, and powerful. He had\ntaken the vow of the order from his\n\np. 47\n\nvery boyhood, and after a hard struggle had succeeded in realising the highest\ntruths of the Vedanta. He wore no clothes whatever, and never rested under a\nroof. When the doors of palaces might have been opened to him if he had only\nwished, he passed the night always under a tree or the blue canopy of the\nheavens, even in winter and in the rainy season, never remaining more than\nthree days in any place, and never caring to ask for food from anybody. Free\nas the wind, he was roaming all over the country, teaching and exhorting\nwherever he could find a sincere soul, and helping them to attain to that\nperfection which he had himself reached. He was a living illustration of the\ntruth that Vedanta, when properly realised, can become a practical rule of\nlife. On seeing _S_ ri Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a sitting on the border of the\nGanges, he at once recognised in him a great Yogin and a perfectly-prepared\nground for the reception of the seeds of the highest truths of religion. He\naddressed him at once and said, \'My son! do you want to learn the way to\nperfect freedom? Come, then, and I will teach it to you.\' Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a,\nwho never did anything without first asking his mother (the goddess Kali),\nsaid that he did not know what he should do, but he would go and ask his\nmother. He came back in a few minutes and told the Sa _m_ nyasin that he was\nready. Tota-puri made him take the vow, and told .him how he was to meditate\nand how to realise unity. After three days of practice he attained to the\nhighest, the Nirvikalpa stage of Samadhi, where there is no longer any\nperception of the subject or of the object. The Sa _m_ nyasin was perfectly\nbewildered at the\n\np. 48\n\nrapid progress of his protege, and said, \'My boy! what I realised after forty\nyears of hard struggle, you have arrived at in three days. I dare not call you\nmy disciple; henceforth I will address you as my friend.\' And such was the\nlove of this holy man for _S_ ri Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a that he stayed with him\nfor eleven months, and in his turn learnt many things from his own disciple.\nThere is a story told of the Sa _m_ nyasin. He always kept a fire and regarded\nit as very holy. One day as he was sitting by this fire and talking to _S_ ri\nRamak _ri_ sh _n_ a, a man came and lighted his pipe out of the same fire. The\nSa _m_ nyasin felt enraged at this sacrilege, when a gentle scolding came from\nhis disciple, who said, \'Is this the way that you look upon everything as\nBrahman? Is not the man himself Brahman as well as the fire? What is high and\nwhat is low in the sight of a _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ anin?\' The Sa _m_ nyasin was brought to\nhis senses, and said, \'Brother, you are right. From this day forth you shall\nnever find me angry again,\' and he kept his word. He could never understand,\nhowever, Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a\'s love for his Mother (the goddess Kali). He\nwould talk of it as mere superstition, and ridicule it, when Ramak _ri_ sh _n_\na made him understand that in the Absolute there is no thou, nor I, nor God,\nnay, that it is beyond all speech or thought. As long, however, as there is\nthe least grain of relativity left, the Absolute is within thought and speech\nand within the limits of the mind, which mind is subservient to the universal\nmind and consciousness; and this omniscient, universal consciousness was to\nhim his mother and God.\n\np. 49\n\nAfter the departure of Tota-puri, Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a himself tried to remain\nalways in union with the absolute Brahman and in the Nirvikalpa state. Looking\nback to this period of his life in his later days, he said, \'I remained for\nsix months in that state of perfect union which people seldom reach, and if\nthey reach it, they cannot return to their individual consciousness again.\nTheir bodies and minds could never bear it. But this my body is made up of\nSattwa particles (pure elements) and can bear much strain. In those days I was\nquite unconscious of the outer world. My body would have died for want of\nnourishment, but for a Sadhu (an advanced religious ascetic) who came at that\ntime and stayed there for three days for my sake. He recognised my state of\nSamadhi, and took much interest to preserve this body, while I was unconscious\nof its very existence. He used to bring some food every day, and when all\nmethods failed to restore sensation or consciousness to this body of mine, he\nwould even strike me with a heavy club, so that the pain might bring me back\nto consciousness. Sometimes he succeeded in awakening a sort of partial\nconsciousness in me, and he would immediately force down one or two mouthfuls\nof food before I was lost again in deep Samadhi. Some days when he could not\nproduce any response, even after a severe beating, he was very sorrowful.\'\nAfter six months the body gave way under these severe irregularities, and\nRamak _ri_ sh _n_ a was laid up with dysentery. This disease, he said, did\nmuch in bringing him back to consciousness, slowly and gently, in a month or\ntwo. When the native physicians had cured him, his\n\np. 50\n\ndeep religious zeal took another turn. He began to practise and realise the\nVaish _n_ ava ideal of love for God. This love, according to the Vaish _n_\navas, becomes manifested practically in any one of the following relations--\nthe relation of a servant to his master, of a friend to his friend, of a child\nto his parents, or vice versa, and a wife to her husband. The highest point of\nlove is reached when the human soul can love his God as a wife loves her\nhusband. The shepherdess of Braja had this sort of love towards the divine K\n_ri_ sh _n_ a, and there was no thought of any carnal relationship. No man,\nthey say, can understand this love of _S_ ri Radha and _S_ ri K _ri_ sh _n_ a\nuntil he is perfectly free from all carnal desires. They even prohibit\nordinary men to read the books which treat of this love of Radha and K _ri_ sh\n_n_ a, because they are still under the sway of passion. Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a,\nin order to realise this love, dressed himself in women\'s attire for several\ndays, thought of himself as a woman, and at last succeeded in gaining his\nideal. He saw the beautiful form of _S_ ri K _ri_ sh _n_ a in a trance, and\nwas satisfied. After having thus devoted himself to Vaish _n_ avism, he\npractised in turn many other religions prevalent in India, even Mohammedanism,\nalways arriving at an understanding of their highest purposes in an incredibly\nshort time. Whenever he wished to learn and practise the doctrines of any\nfaith, he always found a good and learned man of that faith coming to him and\nadvising him how to do it. This is one out of many wonderful things that\nhappened in his life. They may be explained as happy coincidences, which is\nmuch the same as to say they were\n\np. 51\n\nwonderful, and cannot be explained. To give another such instance. At the time\nwhen he perceived the desire of practising and realising religion, he was\nsitting one day under the big banyan-tree (called the Pancha-vati, or the\nplace of the five banyans) to the north of the temple. He found the place very\nsecluded and fit for carrying out his religious practices without disturbance.\nHe was thinking of building a little thatched hut in the place, when the tide\ncame up the river and brought along with it all that was necessary to make a\nlittle hut--the bamboos, the sticks, the rope and all--and dropped them just a\nfew yards off the place where he was sitting. He took the materials joyfully,\nand with the help of the gardener built his little hut, where he practised his\nYoga.\n\nIn his later days he was thinking of practising the tenets of Christianity. He\nhad seen Jesus in a vision, and for three days he could think of nothing and\nspeak of nothing but Jesus and His love. There was this peculiarity in all his\nvisions--that he always saw them outside himself, but when they vanished they\nseemed to have entered into him. This was true of Rama, of _S_ iva, of Kali,\nof K _ri_ sh _n_ a, of Jesus, and of every other god or goddess or prophet.\n\nAfter all these visions and his realisations of different religions he came to\nthe conclusion that all religions are true, though each of them takes account\nof one aspect only of the Akha _n_ _d_ a Sa _k_ _kh_ idananda, i.e. the\nundivided and eternal existence, knowledge, and bliss. Each of these different\nreligions seemed to him a way to arrive at that One.\n\np. 52\n\nDuring all these years he forgot entirely that he had been married, which was\nnot unnatural for one who had lost all idea of the existence even of his own\nbody. The girl had in the meantime attained the age of seventeen or eighteen.\nShe had heard rumours that her husband had become mad, and was in deep grief.\nThen again she heard that he had become a great religious man. She determined\ntherefore to find him and to learn her fate from himself. Having obtained\npermission from her mother, she walked all the way, about thirty or forty\nmiles, to the Dakshi _n_ e _s_ vara temple. Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a received her\nvery kindly, but told her that the old Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a was dead, and that\nthe new one could never look upon any woman as his wife. He said that even\nthen he saw his mother, the Goddess Kali, in her, and however much he might\ntry he could never see anything else. He addressed her as his mother,\nworshipped her with flowers and incense, asked her blessings, as a child does\nfrom his mother, and then became lost in a deep trance. The wife, who was\nfully worthy of such a hero, told him she wanted nothing from him as her\nhusband, but that he would teach her how to realise God, and allow her to\nremain near him and cook his meals and do what little she could for his health\nand comfort. From that day forward she lived within the temple compound, and\nbegan to practise whatever her husband taught her. Mathuranatha offered her\nthe sum of 10,000 Rs., but she declined, saying that her husband had attained\nperfection by renouncing gold and all pleasures, and she did not care for any,\nas she was determined to follow him. She is living\n\np. 53\n\nstill, revered by all for her purity and strength of character, helping others\nof her sex to religion and perfection, looking upon her husband as an\nincarnation of God Himself, and trying to forward the work her husband began.\n\nThough Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a had no proper education, he had such a wonderful\nmemory that he never forgot what he once heard. In his later days he had a\ndesire to hear the Adhyatma Ramaya _n_ a, and he requested one of his\ndisciples to read it to him in the original verse. As he was hearing, another\nof his disciples came and asked him whether he was understanding the original\nverses. He said he had heard the book before, with an explanation of it, and\ntherefore knew all of it, but he wanted to hear it again because the book was\nso beautiful, and he repeated at once the purport of some of the verses which\nfollowed, and which were about to be read.\n\nHe had attained to great Yoga powers, but he never cared to display these\nmarvellous powers to anybody. He told his disciples that all these powers\nwould come to a man as he advanced, but he warned them never to take any heed\nof the opinions of men. They had not to please men, but to try to attain the\nhighest perfection, that is, unity with Brahman. The power of working miracles\nwas rather a hindrance in the way to perfection, inasmuch as it diverted the\nattention of man from his highest goal. But persons who went to him have found\nabundant proofs of his possessing such powers as thought-reading, predicting\nfuture events, seeing things at a distance, and healing a disease by simply\nwilling. The one great power of\n\np. 54\n\nwhich he made most use, and which was by far the most wonderful, was that he\nwas able to change a man\'s thoughts by simply touching his body. In some this\ntouch produced immediate Samadhi, in which they saw visions of gods and\ngoddesses, and lost for some hours all sensation of the out-ward world. In\nothers it produced no outward changes, but they felt that their thoughts had\nreceived a new direction and a new impetus, by which they could easily travel\nin the path of progress in religion. The carnally minded, for instance, would\nfeel that their thoughts never ran after carnal pleasures afterwards, the\nmiser would find that he did not love his gold, and so on.\n\nAbout that time Mathuranatha and his family went on a pilgrimage, and took\nRamak _ri_ sh _n_ a with them. They visited all the sacred places of the\nHindus as far as B _ri_ ndabana, and Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a took the opportunity\nnot only of seeing the temples, but of forming acquaintances with all the\nreligious men, and with the Sa _m_ nyasins who were living in these places,\nsuch as the famous Tailanga Swamin of Benares and Ganga Mata of B _ri_\nndabana. These Sadhus assigned to him a very high position, and regarded him\nnot only as a Brahma _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anin, but as a great religious teacher (\xc3\x82charya),\nnay, as an incarnation of God Himself. At B _ri_ ndabana he was so much struck\nby the natural scenery and associations of the place, that he nearly made up\nhis mind to reside there for ever. But the memory of his old mother made him\nreturn home. On his way back he was so much struck by the poverty of a village\nnear Vaidyanath, that he wept bitterly, and would not go from\n\np. 55\n\nthe place without seeing them happy. So Mathuranatha fed the whole village for\nseveral days, gave proper clothing and some money to each of the villagers,\nand departed with Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a contented.\n\n\'When the rose is blown, and sheds its fragrance all around, the bees come of\nthemselves. The bees seek the full-blown rose, and not the rose the bees.\'\nThis saying of _S_ ri Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a has been verified often and often in\nhis own life. Numbers of earnest men, of all sects and creeds, began to flock\nto him to receive instruction and to drink the waters of life. From day-dawn\nto night-fall he had no leisure to eat or drink, so engaged was he in\nteaching, exhorting, and ministering to the wants of these hungry and thirsty\nmillions. Men possessed of wonderful Yoga powers and great learning came to\nlearn from this illiterate Paramaha _m_ sa of Dakshi _n_ e _s_ vara, and in\ntheir turn acknowledged him as their spiritual director (Guru), touched as\nthey were by the wonderful purity, the childlike simplicity, the perfect\nunselfishness, and by the simple language in which he propounded the highest\ntruths of religion and philosophy. But the people of Calcutta knew him not\ntill Babu Keshub Chunder Son went to him and wrote about him. Ramak _ri_ sh\n_n_ a\'s interview with Keshub was brought about in this way. It was in the\nyear 1866 that Keshub was leading a life of prayer and seclusion in a garden\nhouse at Belgharia, about two miles from the temple of Dakshi _n_ e _s_ vara.\nRamak _ri_ sh _n_ a heard of him, and went to see him. Keshub was so much\nimpressed with the simple words, full of the highest knowledge, the\n\np. 56\n\nwonderful love of God, and the deep trances of _S_ ri Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a,\nthat he began to come often and often to him. He would sit for hours at the\nfeet of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a and listen with rapture to the wonderful sayings\non religion of that wonderful man. From time to time Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a would\nbe lost in a deep Samadhi, and Keshub would gently touch his feet that he\nmight thereby be purified. Sometimes he would invite the Paramaha _m_ sa to\nhis house, or would take him in a boat and proceed a few miles up and down the\nriver. He then used to question him on some points of religion to clear away\nhis own doubts. A strong and deep love grew up between the two, and Keshub\'s\nwhole life became changed, till, a few years later, he proclaimed his views of\nreligion as the New Dispensation, which was nothing but a partial\nrepresentation of the truths which Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a had taught for a long\ntime.\n\nA brief sketch of the teachings of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, and a few of his\nsayings, which Keshub published, were sufficient to rouse a wide interest in\nthe Paramaha _m_ sa, and numbers of highly-educated men of Calcutta and women\nof noble family began to pour in to receive instruction from this wonderful\nYogin. Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a began to teach them and talk to them from morn till\nevening. At night, too, he had no rest, for some of the more earnest would\nremain and spend the night with him. He then forgot his sleep, and talked to\nthem incessantly about Bhakti (devotion) or _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana (knowledge) and his\nown experiences, and how he arrived at them. Though this incessant labour\n\np. 57\n\nbegan at last to tell upon him, yet he would not rest. In the meanwhile the\ncrowds of men and women began to increase daily, and he went on as before.\nWhen pressed to take rest, he would say, \'I would suffer willingly all sorts\nof bodily pains, and death also, a hundred thousand times, if by so doing I\ncould bring one single soul to freedom. and salvation.\'\n\nIn the beginning of 1885 he suffered from what is known as \'the clergyman\'s\nthroat,\' which by-and-by developed into cancer. He was removed to Calcutta,\nand the best physicians were engaged, such as Babu Mohindra Lal Sircar, &c.,\nwho advised him to keep the strictest silence; but the advice was to no\neffect. Crowds of men and women gathered wherever he went, and waited\npatiently to hear a single word from his mouth, and he, out of compassion for\nthem, would not remain silent. Many a time he would be lost in a Samadhi,\nlosing all consciousness of his body and of his disease, and coming back he\nwould talk incessantly as before. Even when the passage of his throat became\nso constricted that he could not swallow even liquid food, he would never stop\nhis efforts. He was undaunted and remained as cheerful as ever, till on August\n16, 1886, at 10 o\'clock in the night, he entered into Samadhi, from which he\nnever returned. His disciples took it at first to be an ordinary Samadhi, such\nas he used to have every day, during which the best doctors even could not\nfind any pulsation or beating of the heart; but, alas, they were mistaken.\n\nRamak _ri_ sh _n_ a felt such an aversion to gold and silver\n\np. 58\n\nthat he could not even touch them, and a simple touch, even when he was\nasleep, would produce physical contortions. His breath would stop, and his\nfingers would become contorted and paralysed for a few minutes, even when the\nmetal had been removed. In his later days he could touch no metals, not even\niron.\n\nHe was a wonderful mixture of God and man. In his ordinary state he would talk\nof himself as servant of all men and women. He looked upon them all as God. He\nhimself would never be addressed as Guru, or teacher. Never would he claim for\nhimself any high position. He would touch the ground reverently where his\ndisciples had trodden. But every now and then strange fits of God-\nconsciousness came upon him. He then became changed into a different being\naltogether. He then spoke of himself as being able to do and know everything.\nHe spoke as if he had the power of giving anything to anybody. He would speak\nof himself as the same soul that had been born before as Rama, as K _ri_ sh\n_n_ a, as Jesus, or as Buddha, born again as Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a. He told\nMathuranatha, long before anybody knew him, that he had many disciples who\nwould come to him shortly, and he knew all of them. He said that he was free\nfrom all eternity, and the practices and struggles after religion which he\nwent through were only meant to show the people the way to salvation. He had\ndone all for them alone. He would say he was a Nitya-mukta, or eternally free,\nand an incarnation of God Himself. \'The fruit of the pumpkin,\' he said, \'comes\nout first, and then the flowers; so it is with the Nitya-muktas,\n\np. 59\n\nor those who are free from all eternity, but come down for the good of\nothers.\'\n\nDuring the state of Samadhi he was totally unconscious of himself and of the\noutward world. At one time he fell down upon a piece of live coal during this\nstate. It burned deep into his flesh, but he did not know for hours, and the\nsurgeon had to come in to extract the coal, when he came back to\nconsciousness, and felt the wound.\n\nAt another time his foot slipped, and he broke his hand. The surgeon carne and\nbound it up and advised him not to use it till it was quite cured. But it was\nimpossible. As soon as anybody spoke anything of religion or on God, he went\nstraight into the state of Samadhi, and his hands became straight and stiff,\nand the injured hand had to be bound up again. This went on for months, and it\ntook six months or more to cure that simple fracture.\n\nMathuranatha proposed again and again to hand over to him the temple of Dakshi\n_n_ e _s_ vara and a property yielding an income of 25,000 Rs. a year, but he\ndeclined the proposal, and added that he would have to fly away from the place\nif Mathuranatha pressed his gift upon him. At another time another gentleman\nmade an offer of some 25,000 Rs. to him, with the same result.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[30:1](rls14.htm#fr_8) Even dates are inaccurate in the biographical notices\nof Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, as published in various Indian papers immediately\nafter his death.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Remarks on Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a\'s Life](rls15.htm)\n\n'
