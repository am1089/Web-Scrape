What earthly thing  \nCan rest, or hope, or pleasure bring?'  \n\nThus the sad town, which Rama kept  \nAs a kind father, wailed and wept.  \nEach mansion, as the car went by,  \nSent forth a loud and bitter cry,  \nAs to the window every dame,  \nMourning for banished Rama, came.  \nAs his sad eyes with tears o'erflowed,  \nHe sped along the royal road  \nTo Das'aratha's high abode.  \nThere leaping down his car he stayed;  \nWithin the gates his way he made;  \nThrough seven broad courts he onward hied  \nWhere people thronged on every side.  \nFrom each high terrace, wild with woe  \nThe royal Indies flocked below:  \n\np. 163  \n\nHe heard them talk in gentle tone,  \nAs each for Rama made her moan:  \n'What will the charioteer reply  \nTo Queen Kaus'alya's eager cry?  \nWith Rama from the gates he went;  \nHomeward alone, his steps are bent.  \nHard is a life with woe distressed!  \nBut difficult to win is rest,  \nIf, when her son is banished, still  \nShe lives beneath her load of ill.'  \n\nSuch was the speech Sumantra heard  \nFrom them whom grief unfeigned had stirred.  \nAs fires of anguish burnt him through,  \nSwift to the monarch's hall he drew,  \nPast the eighth court; there met his sight,  \nThe sovereign in his palace bright,  \nStill weeping for his son, forlorn,  \nPale, faint, and all with sorrow worn.  \nAs there he sat, Sumantra bent  \nAnd did obeisance reverent,  \nAnd to the king repeated o'er  \nThe message he from Rama bore.  \nThe monarch heard, and well-nigh brake  \nHis heart, but yet no word he spake:  \nFainting to earth he fell, and dumb,  \nBy grief for Rama overcome,  \nRang through the hall a startling cry,  \nAnd women's arms were tossed on high,  \nWhen, with his senses all astray,  \nUpon the ground the monarch lay.  \nKaus'alya with Sumitras aid,  \nRaised from the ground her lord dismayed:  \n'Sire, of high fate, she cried, O, why  \nDost thou no single word reply  \nTo Rama's messenger who brings  \nNews of his painful wanderings?  \nThe great injustice done, art thou  \nShame-stricken for thy conduct now?  \nRise up, and do thy part: bestow  \nComfort and help in this our woe.  \nSpeak freely, King; dismiss thy fear,  \nFor Queen Kaikeyi stands not near,  \nAfraid of whom thou wouldst not seek  \nTidings of Rama: freely speak.'  \n\nWhen the sad queen had ended so,  \nShe sank, insatiate in her woe,  \nAnd prostrate lay upon the ground,  \nWhile her faint voice by sobs was drowned.  \nWhen all the ladies in despair  \nSaw Queen Kaus'alya wailing there,  \nAnd the poor king oppressed with pain,  \nThey flocked around and wept again.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[162:1](ry134.htm#fr_332) Deities of a particular class in which five or ten\nare enumerated.
