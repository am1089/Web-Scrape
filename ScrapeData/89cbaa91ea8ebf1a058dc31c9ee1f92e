O Lakshman, save?  \nNow let my words thy spirit cheer.  \nCompose thy thoughts and banish fear.  \nIn hell, in earth, or in the skies  \nThere is not, and there cannot rise  \nA champion whose strong arm can slay  \nThy Rama in the battle fray.  \nTo heavenly hosts he ne'er would yield  \nThough Indra led them to the field.  \nTo soothe her thus I vainly sought:  \nHer heart with woe was still distraught.  \nWhile from her eyes the waters ran  \nHer bitter speech she thus began:  \n'Too well I see thy dark intent:  \nThy lawless thoughts on me are bent.  \nThou hopest, but thy hope is vain,  \nTo win my love, thy brother slain.  \nNot love, but Bharat's dark decree  \nTo share his exile counselled thee,  \n\np. 300  \n\nOr hearing now his bitter cry  \nThou surely to his aid wouldst fly.  \nFor love of me, a stealthy foe  \nThou choosest by his side to go,  \nAnd now thou longest that my lord  \nShould die, and wilt no help afford.'  \n   Such were the words the lady said:  \nWith angry fire my eyes were red.  \nWith pale lips quivering in my rage  \nI hastened from the hermitage.'  \nHe ceased; and frenzied by his pain  \nThe son of Raghu spoke again:  \n'O brother, for thy fault I grieve,  \nThe Maithil dame alone to leave.  \nThou knowest that my arm is strong  \nTo save me from the giant throng,  \nAnd yet couldst leave the cottage, spurred  \nTo folly by her angry word.  \nFor this thy deed I praise thee not,--  \nTo leave her helpless in the cot,  \nAnd thus thy sacred charge forsake  \nFor the wild words a woman spake.  \nYea thou art all to blame herein,  \nAnd very grievous is thy sin.  \nThat anger swayed thy faithless breast  \nAnd made thee false to my behest.  \nAn arrow speeding from my bow  \nHas laid the treacherous giant low,  \nWho lured me eager for the chase  \nFar from my hermit dwelling-place.  \nThe string with easy hand I drew,  \nThe arrow as in pastime flew,  \n   The wounded quarry bled.  \nThe borrowed form was cast away,  \nBefore mine eye a giant lay  \n   With bright gold braceleted.  \nMy arrow smote him in the chest:  \nThe giant by the pain distressed  \n   Raised his loud voice on high.  \nFar rang the mournful sound: mine own,  \nIt seemed, were accent, voice, and tone,  \nThey made thee leave my spouse alone  \n   And to my rescue fly,'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXI.: Rama's Lament.](ry259.htm)\n\n"
