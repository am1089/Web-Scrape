(showing) of what\ndescription is the institution of the five sacrificial priests. The learned\nknow this to be a great principle, that the Pra _n_ a and the Apana, and the\nUdana, and also the Samana and the Vyana, are the five sacrificial priests.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a's wife said:\n\nMy former belief was that the sacrificial priests were seven. by (their)\nnature 4. State how the great principle is that there are verily five\nsacrificial priests 5.\n\np. 271\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said:\n\nThe wind prepared by the Pra _n_ a afterwards becomes the Apana. The wind\nprepared in the Apana then works as the Vyana. The wind prepared by the Vyana\nworks as the Udana. And the wind prepared in the Udana is produced as Samana\n1. They formerly went to the grandsire, who was born first, and said to him,\n'Tell us which is greatest among us. He shall be the greatest among us 2.'\n\nBrahman said:\n\nHe, verily, is the greatest, who being extinct, all the life-winds in the body\nof living creatures become extinct; and on whose moving about, they again move\nabout. (Now) go where (you) like.\n\nThe Pra _n_ a said:\n\nWhen I am extinct, all the life-winds in the body\n\np. 272\n\nof living creatures become extinct; and on my moving about, they again move\nabout. I am the greatest. See I am extinct!\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said:\n\nThen the Pra _n_ a became extinct, and again moved about. Then the Samana and\nUdana also 1, O beautiful one! spoke these words, 'You do not pervade all this\nhere as we do. You are not the greatest among us, O Pra _n_ a, because the\nApana is subject to you 2.' The Pra _n_ a again moved about 3, and the Apana 4\nsaid to him.\n\nThe Apana said:\n\nWhen I am extinct, all the life-winds in the body of living creatures become\nextinct; and on my moving about, they again move about. I am the. greatest.\nSee I am extinct!\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said:\n\nThen the Vyana and the Udana addressed him who was speaking (thus): 'You are\nnot the greatest, O Apana! because the Pra _n_ a is subject to you.' Then the\nApana moved about, and the Vyana spoke to him: 'I am the greatest among (you)\nall. Hear the reason why. When I am extinct, all the life-winds in the body of\nliving creatures become extinct.\n\np. 273\n\nAnd on my moving about, they again move about. I am the greatest. See I am\nextinct!'\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said:\n\nThen the Vyana became extinct, and again moved about. And the Prana and Apana,\nand the Udana, and the Samana, spoke to him, 'You are not the greatest among\nus, O Vyana! because the Samana 1 is subject to you.' The Vyana moved about\nagain, and the Samana spoke again. 'I am the greatest among (you) all. Hear\nthe reason why. When I am extinct, all the life-winds in the body of living\ncreatures become extinct; and on my moving about, they again move about. I am\nthe greatest. See I am extinct!' Then the Samana moved about, and the Udana\nsaid to him: 'I am the greatest among (you) all. Hear the reason why. When I\nam extinct, all the life-winds in the body of living creatures become extinct;\nand on my moving about, they again move about. I am the greatest. See I am\nextinct!' Then the Udana became extinct, and again moved about. And the Pra\n_n_ a and Apana, and the Samana, and the Vyana also, spoke to him: 'O Udana!\nyou are not the greatest. The Vyana 2 only is subject to you.'\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said:\n\nThen Brahman, the lord of (all) creatures, said. to them who were assembled\ntogether: You are all greatest, and not greatest 3. You are all possessed\n\np. 274\n\nof one another's qualities [1](sbe0836.htm#fn_1305). All are greatest in their\nown spheres, and all support one another. There is one unmoving\n[2](sbe0836.htm#fn_1306) (life-wind). There are others moving about, (which\nare) five, owing to (their) specific qualities. My own self is one only\n[3](sbe0836.htm#fn_1307), (but) accumulated in numerous (forms). Being\nfriendly with one another, and pleasing one another, go away happily. Welfare\nbe to you! Support one another.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[270:1](sbe0834.htm#fr_1296) The senses are the doors of the house here, as\nthey are among the doors of the city at Gita, [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65).\n\n[270:2](sbe0834.htm#fr_1297) Owing to the want of food, &c. Cf. Maitri, p.\n112, and _Kh_ andogya. p. 422.\n\n[270:3](sbe0834.htm#fr_1298) Perception of pleasure, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra; but he takes the subsequent clause to mean this, 'and without you no\npleasure accrues to us either.' The text is here in an unsatisfactory state.\n\n[270:4](sbe0835.htm#fr_1299) As stated in the last chapter; some MSS. read\n'your' for 'my' at the beginning of the sentence.\n\n[270:5](sbe0835.htm#fr_1300) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says that in this Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_\nahot _ri_ -vidhana the five chief Hot _ri_ s only are stated for briefly\nexplaining the Pra _n_ ayama.\n\n[271:1](sbe0835.htm#fr_1301) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, 'The wind going to the\nPra _n_ a, and being obstructed in upward progress by the Pra _n_ a, goes to\nthe Apana, and then unable to go upwards or downwards, enters the passages or\nna _d_ is of the body and becomes Vyana. In the same way Udana, by the\ncollision of the two, produces sound in the throat, and depends on Pra _n_ a\nand Apana; so, too, the Samana dwelling in the navel and kindling the gastric\nfire is also dependent on those two.' The meaning seems to be that one life-\nwind is distributed in the different places, and gets different names, as\nstated, in the order mentioned. See Maitri, p. 28.\n\n[271:2](sbe0835.htm#fr_1302) A similar visit on the part of the Pra _n_ as\n(who, however, are not there the life-winds only, but the Pra _n_ a life-wind\nand the active organs) to Pra _g_ apati is mentioned at B _ri_ hadara _n_\nyaka-upanishad, p. 1016, and _Kh_ andogya, p. 297. Cf. also Pra _s_ na, p.\n178; B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 317; and Kaushitaki, p. 63. See also,\ngenerally, as to the life-winds and their functions, B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka,\np. 280, and _S_ a _n_ kara's comment there; Yoga-sutras III, 38, and comment;\nCowell's note at Maitri, p. 247; _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 184,\nst. 24-25; chap. 185, st. 1 seq.; and [p. 258](sbe0832.htm#page_258) supra.\n\n[272:1](sbe0835.htm#fr_1303) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, Vyana and Apana also\nby force of the two 'ands' which occur in the original; and so in other places\ntoo.\n\n[272:2](sbe0835.htm#fr_1304) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says on this, 'The Pra _n_ a\nmoves upwards through the help of the Apana. If it moved downwards, it would\nbe simply absorbed into the Apana.'\n\n[272:3](sbe0835.htm#fr_1305) I. e. recommenced its, proper operation in its\nproper place.\n\n[272:4](sbe0835.htm#fr_1306) And the other life-winds also, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra says, the name Pra _n_ a being merely 'indicative,' as the phrase is, of\nthe class to which it belongs.\n\n[273:1](sbe0835.htm#fr_1307) Because the Samana helps in the digestion of the\nfood which afterwards goes to the Vyana for distribution through the na _d_\nis.\n\n[273:2](sbe0835.htm#fr_1308) Because the Udana is able to generate sound after\nthe na _d_ is are filled up by the Vyana.\n\n[273:3](sbe0835.htm#fr_1309) 'Not greatest' because none of them is\nindependent of the other. 'Greatest' Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra renders by 'superior\nto objects.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IX](sbe0836.htm)\n\n"
