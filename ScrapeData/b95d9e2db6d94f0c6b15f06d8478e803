Being tired, she sat down by the\nroadside, placing the child and the cans full of milk beside her; when, on a\nsudden, two large Eagles flew overhead, and one, swooping down, seized the\nchild, and flew away with her out of the mother\'s sight.\n\nVery far, far away the Eagle carried the little baby; even beyond the borders\nof her native land, until they reached their home in a lofty tree. There the\nold Eagles had built a great nest; it was made of iron and wood, and was as\nbig as a little house; there was iron all round, ~and to get in and out you\nhad to go through seven iron doors.\n\nIn this stronghold they placed- the little baby, and because she was like a\nyoung Eaglet they called her Surya Bai (The Sun Lady). The Eagles both loved\nthe child; and daily they flew into distant countries to bring her rich and\nprecious things. Clothes that had been made for princesses, precious jewels,\nwonderful playthings, all that was most costly and rare.\n\nOne day, when Surya Bai -was twelve years old, the old husband Eagle said to\nhis wife\' \'Wife, our daughter has no diamond ring on her little finger, such\nas princesses wear; let us go and fetch her one.\' \'Yes,\' said the other old\nEagle; \'but to fetch it we must go very far.\' \'T rue,\' rejoined he, \'such a\nring is not to be got nearer than the Red Sea, and that is a twelve month\'s\njourney from here; nevertheless we will go.\' So the Eagles started off,\nleaving Surya Bai in the strong nest, with twelve months\' provisions (that she\nmight not be hungry whilst they were away), and a little dog and cat to take\ncare of her.\n\nSome time after they were gone, one day the naughty little cat stole some food\nfrom the store, for doing which Surya Bai punished her. The cat did not like\nbeing whipped, and she was still more annoyed at having been caught stealing;\nso, in revenge, she ran to the fireplace (they were obliged to keep a fire\nalways burning in the Eagles\' nest, as Surya Bai never went down from the\ntree, and would not otherwise have been able to cook her dinner), and put out\nthe fire. When the little girl saw this, she was much vexed, for the cat had\neaten their last cooked provisions, and she did not know what they were to do\nfor food. For three whole days Surya Bai puzzled over the difficulty, and for\nthree whole days she, and the dog, and the cat, had nothing to eat. At last\nshe thought she would climb to the edge of the nest, and see if she could see\nany fire in the country below; and, if so, she would go down and ask the\npeople who lighted it to give her a little with which to cook her dinner. So\nshe climbed to the edge of the nest. Then, very far away on the horizon, she\nsaw a thin curl of blue smoke. So she let herself down from the tree, and all\nday long she walked in the direction whence the smoke came. Towards evening\nshe reached the place, and found it rose from a small hut in which sat an old\nwoman warming her hands over a fire. Now, though Surya Bai did not know it,\nshe had reached the Rakshas\' country, and this old woman was none other than a\nwicked old Rakshas, who lived with her son in the little hut. The young\nRakshas, however, had gone out for the day. When the old Rakshas saw Surya\nBai, she was much astonished, for the girl was beautiful as the Sun, and her\nrich dress was resplendent with jewels; and she said to herself, \'How lovely\nthis child is! what a dainty morsel she would be! Oh, if my son were only here\nwe would kill her, and boil her, and eat her. I will try and detain her till\nhis return.\' Then turning to Surya Bai, she said, \'Who are you, and what do\nyou want?\' Surya Bai answered, \'I am the daughter of the great Eagles, but\nthey have gone a far journey to fetch me a diamond ring, and the fire has died\nout in the nest. Give me, I pray you, a little from your hearth.\' The Rakshas\nreplied, \'You shall certainly have some, only first pound this rice for me,\nfor I am old, and have no\n\ndaughter to help me.\' Then Surya Bai pounded the rice, but the young Rakshas\nhad not returned by the time she had finished; so the old Rakshas said to her,\n\'If you are kind, grind this corn for me, for it is hard work for my old\nhands.\' Then she ground the corn, but still the young Rakshas came not; and\nthe old Rakshas said to her, \'Sweep the house for me first, and then I will\ngive you the fire.\' So Surya Bai swept the house; but still the young Rakshas\ndid not come.\n\nThen his mother said to Surya Bai, \'Why should you be in such a hurry to go\nhome? fetch me some water from the well and then you shall have the fire.\' And\nshe fetched the water. When she had done so, Surya Bai said, \'I have done all\nyour bidding; now give me the fire, or I will go elsewhere and seek it.\'\n\nThe old Rakshas was grieved because her son had not returned home: but she saw\nshe could detain Surya Bai no longer, so she said, \'Take the fire and go in\npeace; take also some parched corn, and scatter it along the road as you go,\nso as to make a pretty little pathway from our house to yours;\' and so saying\nshe gave Surya Bai several handfuls of parched corn. The girl took them,\nfearing no evil, and as she went she scattered the grains on the road. Then\nshe climbed back into the nest and shut the seven iron doors, and lighted the\nfire, and cooked the food, and gave the dog and the cat some dinner, and took\nsome herself, and went to sleep.\n\nScarcely had Surya Bai left the Rakshas\' hut, when the young Rakshas returned,\nand his mother said to him, \'Alas, alas, my son! why did not you come sooner?\nSuch a sweet little lamb has been here, and now we have lost her.\' Then she\ntold him all about Surya Bai. \'Which way did she go?\' asked the young Rakshas;\n\'only tell me that, and I\'ll have her before morning.\'\n\nHis mother had told him how she had given Surya Bai the parched corn to\nscatter on the road; and when he heard that, he followed up the track, and\nran, and ran, and ran, till he came to the foot of the tree.\n\nThere, looking up, he saw the nest high in the branches above him.\n\nQuick as thought, up he climbed, and reached the great outer door; and he\nshook it, and shook it, but he could not get in, for Surya Bai had bolted it.\nThen he said, \'Let me in, my child, let me in; I\'m the great Eagle, and I have\ncome from very far, and brought you many beautiful jewels; and here is a\nsplendid diamond ring to fit your little finger.\' But Surya Bal did not hear\nhim, she was fast asleep.\n\nHe next tried to force open the door again, but it was too strong for him. In\nhis efforts, however, he had broken off one of his finger-nails--(now the nail\nof a Rakshas is most poisonous)--which he left sticking in the crack of the\ndoor when he went away.\n\nNext morning Surya Bai opened all the doors in order to look down on the world\nbelow; but when she came to the seventh door a sharp thing, which was sticking\nin it, ran into her hand, and immediately she fell down dead.\n\nAt that same moment the two poor old Eagles returned from their long\ntwelvemonth\'s journey, bringing a beautiful diamond ring, which they had\nfetched for their little favourite from the Red Sea.\n\nThere she lay on the threshold of the nest, beautiful as ever, but cold and\ndead.\n\nThe Eagles could not bear the sight; so they placed the ring on her finger,\nand then, with loud cries, flew off to return no more.\n\nBut a little while after there chanced to come by a great Rajah, who was out\non a hunting expedition. He came with hawks, and hounds, and attendants, and\nhorses, and pitched his camp under the tree in which the Eagles\' nest was\nbuilt. Then looking up he saw, amongst the topmost branches, what appeared\nlike a queer little house, and he sent some of his attendants to see what it\nwas. They soon returned, and told the Rajah that up in the tree was a curious\nthing like a cage, having seven iron doors, and that on the threshold of the\nfirst door lay a fair maiden, richly dressed; that she was dead, and that\nbeside her stood a little dog and a little cat.\n\nAt this the Rajah commanded that they should be fetched down, and when he saw\nSurya Bai he felt very sad to think that she was dead. And he took her hand to\nfeel if it were already stiff; but all her limbs were supple, nor had she\nbecome cold, as the dead are cold; and, looking again at her hand, the Rajah\nsaw that a sharp thing, like a long thorn, had run into the tender palm,\nalmost far enough to pierce through to the back of her hand.\n\nHe pulled it out, and no sooner had he done so than Surya Bai opened her eyes,\nand stood up, crying, \'Where am I? and who are you? Is it a dream, or true?\'\n\nThe Rajah answered, \'It is all true, beautiful lady. I am Rajah of a\nneighbouring land; pray tell me who are you?\'\n\nShe replied, \'I am the Eagles\' child.\' But he laughed: \'Nay he said, \'that\ncannot be, you are some great Princess.\' \'No,\' she answered, \'I am no royal\nlady; what I say is true. I have lived all my life in this tree. I am only the\nEagles\' child.\'\n\nThen the Rajah said, \'If you are not a Princess born, I will make you one; say\nonly that you will be my Queen.\'\n\nSurya Bai consented, and the Rajah took her to his kingdom and made her his\nQueen. But Surya Bai was not his only wife and the first Ranee, his other\nwife, was both envious and jealot of her.  1\n\nThe Rajah gave Surya Bai many trustworthy attendants I guard her and be with\nher, and one old woman loved her more than all the rest, and used to say to\nher--\' Don\'t be too intimate with the first Ranee, dear lady, for she wishes\nyou no good, an she has power to do you harm. Some day she may poison or\notherwise injure you.\' But Surya Bai would answer he \'Nonsense! what is there\nto be alarmed about? Why cannot we both live happily together like two\nsisters?\' Then the old woman would rejoin, \'Ah, dear lady, may you never live\nto rue your confidence! I pray my fears may prove folly.\' So Surya Bai went\noften to see the first Ranee, and the first Ranee also came often to see her.\n\nOne day they were standing in the palace court-yard, near tank, where the\nRajah\'s people used to bathe, and the first Ram said to Surya Bai, \'What\npretty jewels you have, sister! let me try them on for a minute, and see how I\nlook in them.\'\n\nThe old woman was standing beside Surya Bai, and sh whispered to her, \'Do not\nlend your jewels.\' \'Hush, you silly old woman,\' answered she; \'what harm will\nit do?\' and she gave the Ranee her jewels. Then the Ranee said, \'How pretty a\nyour things are! do you not think they look well even on me Let us come down\nto the tank, it is as clear as glass, and we ca see ourselves reflected in it,\nand how these jewels will shine in the clear water!\'\n\nThe old woman, hearing this, was much alarmed, and begged Surya Bai not to\nventure near the tank, but she said, \'I bid you be silent, I will not distrust\nmy sister;\' and she went down to the tank. Then, when no one was near, and\nthey were both leaning over, looking at their reflections in the water, the\nfirst Ranee pushed Surya Bai into the tank, who, sinking under the water, was\ndrowned; and from the place where her body fell there sprang up a bright\ngolden sunflower.\n\nThe Rajah shortly afterwards inquired where Surya Bai was,--but nowhere could\nshe be found. Then, very angry, he came to the first Ranee and said, \'Tell me\nwhere the child is. You have made away with her.\' But she answered, \'You do me\nwrong, I know nothing of her. Doubtless that old woman, whom you allowed to be\nalways with her, has done her some harm.\' So the Rajah ordered the poor old\nwoman to be thrown into prison.\n\nHe tried to forget Surya Bai and all her pretty ways, but it was no good.\nWherever he went, he saw her face. Whatever he heard, he still listened for\nher voice. Every day he grew more miserable; he would not eat nor drink; and\nas for the other Ranee, he could not bear to speak to her. All his people\nsaid, \'He will surely die.\'\n\nWhen matters were in this state, the Rajah one day wandered to the edge of the\ntank, and bending over the parapet, looked into the water. Then he was\nsurprised to see, growing out of the tank, close beside him, a stately golden\nflower; and as he watched it, the sunflower gently bent its head, and leaned\ndown towards him. The Rajah\'s heart was softened, and he kissed its leaves and\nmurmured, \'This flower reminds me of my lost wife. I love it, it is fair and\ngentle as she used to be.\' And every day he would go down to the tank, and sit\nand watch the flower. When the Ranee heard this, she ordered her servants to\ngo and dig up the sunflower, and to take it far into the jungle and burn it.\nNext time the Rajah went to the tank he found his flower gone, and he was very\ngrieved, but none dared say who had done it.\n\nThen, in the jungle, from the place where the ashes of the sunflower had been\nthrown, there sprang up a young mango tree, tall and straight, that grew so\nquickly, and became such a beautiful tree, that it was the wonder of all the\ncountry round. At last, on its topmost bough, came one fair blossom; and the\nblossom fell, and the little mango grew rosier and rosier, and larger and\nlarger, till so wonderful was it, both for size and shape, that people flocked\nfrom far and near only to look at it.\n\nBut none ventured to gather it, for it was to be kept for the Rajah himself.\n\nNow one day, the poor Milkwoman, Surya Bal\'s mother, was returning homewards\nafter her day\'s work, with the empty milk. cans; and, being very tired with\nher long walk to the bazaar~ she lay down under the mango tree and fell\nasleep. Then right into her largest milk-can fell the wonderful mango. When\nthe poor woman awoke and saw what had happened, she was dreadfully frightened,\nand thought to herself, \'If any one sees me with this wonderful fruit, that\nall the Rajah\'s great people have been watching for so many, many weeks, they\nwill never believe that I did not steal it, and I shall be put in prison. Yet\nit is no good leaving it here; besides, it fell off of itself into my milk-\ncan. I will therefore take it home as secretly as possible, and share it with\nmy children.\'\n\nSo the Milkwoman covered up the can in which the mango was, and took it\nquickly to her home, where she placed it in the corner of the room, and put\nover it a dozen other milk-cans, piled one above another. Then as soon as it\nwas dark, she called her husband and eldest son (for she had six or seven\nchildren), and said to them, \'What good fortune do you think has befallen me\nto-day?\'\n\n\'We cannot guess,\' they said. \'Nothing less,\' she when on, \'than the\nwonderful, wonderful mango falling into one of my milk-cans while I slept! I\nhave brought it home with me; it is in that lowest can. Go, husband, call all\nthe children to have a slice; and you, my son, take down that pile of cans,\nand fetch me the mango.\' \'Mother,\' he said, when he got to the lowest can,\n\'you were joking, I suppose, when you told us there was a mango here.\'\n\n\'No, not at all,\' she answered, \'there is a mango there. I put it there myself\nan hour ago.\'\n\n\'Well, there\'s something quite different now,\' replied her son. \'Come and\nsee.\'\n\nThe Milkwoman ran to the place, and there, in the lowest can, she saw, not the\nmango, but a little tiny wee lady, richly dressed in red and gold, and no\nbigger than a mango! On her head shone a bright jewel like a little sun.\n\n\'This is very odd,\' said the mother. \'I never heard of such a thing in my\nlife! But since she has been sent to us, I will take care of her as if she\nwere my own child.\'\n\nEvery day the little lady grew taller and taller, until she was the size of an\nordinary woman; she was gentle and loveable, but always very sad and quiet,\nand she said her name was \'Surya Bai.\'\n\nThe children were all very curious to know her history, but the Milk-woman and\nher husband would not let her be teased to say who she was, and said to the\nchildren, \'Let us wait. By and by, when she knows us better, she will most\nlikely tell us her story of her own accord.\'\n\nNow it came to pass that once, when Surya Bai was taking water from the well\nfor the old Milk-woman, the Rajah rode by, and as he saw her walking along, he\ncried, \'That is my wife,\' and rode after her as fast as possible. Surya Bai,\nhearing a great clatter of horses\' hoofs, was frightened, and ran home as\nquickly as she could, and hid herself; and when the Rajah reached the place\nthere was only the old Milk-woman to be seen, standing at the door of her hut.\n\nThen the Rajah said to her, \'Give her up, old woman, you have no right to keep\nher; she is mine, she is mine!\' But the old woman answered, \'Are you mad? I\ndon\'t know what you mean.\'\n\nThe Rajah replied, \'Do not attempt to deceive me. I saw my wife go in at your\ndoor she must be in the house.\'\n\n\'Your wife?\' screamed the old woman--\'your wife? You mean my daughter, who\nlately returned from the well! Do you think I am going to give up my child at\nyour command? You are Rajah in your palace, but I am Rajah in my own house;\nand I won\'t give up my little daughter for any bidding of yours. Be off with\nyou, or I\'ll pull out your beard.\' And so saying she seized a long stick and\nattacked the Rajah, calling out loudly for assistance to her husband and sons,\nwho came running to her aid.\n\nThe Rajah, seeing matters were against him, and having out-ridden his\nattendants (and not being quite certain moreover whether he had seen Surya\nBai, or whether she might not have been really the poor Milk-woman\'s\ndaughter), rode off and returned to his palace.\n\nHe determined, however, to sift the matter. As a first step he went to see\nSurya Bai\'s old attendant, who was still in prison. From her he learnt enough\nto make him believe she was not only entirely innocent of Surya Bai\'s death,\nbut gravely to suspect the first Ranee of having caused it. He therefore\nordered the old woman to be set at liberty--still keeping a watchful eye on\nher--and bade her prove her devotion to her long-lost mistress by going to the\nMilk-woman\'s house, and bringing him as much information as possible about the\nfamily, and more particularly about the girl he had seen returning from the\nwell.\n\nSo the attendant went to the Milk-woman\'s house, and made friends with her,\nand bought some milk, and afterwards she stayed and talked to her.\n\nThis she did several times, and after a few days the Milkwoman ceased to be\nsuspicious of her, and became quite cordial.\n\nSurya Bai\'s attendant then told how she had been the late Ranee\'s waiting-\nwoman, and how the Rajah had thrown her into prison on her mistress\'s death;\nin return for which intelligence the old Milk-woman imparted to her how the\nwonderful mango had tumbled into her can, as she slept under the tree; and how\nit had miraculously changed in the course of an hour into a beautiful little\nlady. \'I wonder why she should have chosen my poor house to live in, instead\nof any one else\'s,\' said the old woman.\n\nThen Surya Bai\'s attendant said, \'Have you ever asked her her history? Perhaps\nshe would not mind telling it to you now.\'\n\nSo the Milk-woman called the girl, and as soon as the old attendant saw her,\nshe knew it was none other than Surya Bai, and her heart jumped for joy; but\nshe remained silent, wondering much, for she knew her mistress had been\ndrowned in the tank.\n\nThe old Milk-woman turned to Surya Bai and said, \'My child, you have lived\nlong with us, and been a good daughter to me; but I have never asked you your\nhistory, because I thought it must be a sad one; but if you do not fear to\ntell it to me now, I should like to hear it.\'\n\nSurya Bai answered, \'Mother, you speak true; my story is sad. I believe my\nreal mother was a poor Milk-woman like you, and that she took me with her one\nday when I was quite a little baby, as she was going to sell milk in the\nbazaar. But being tired with the long walk, she sat down to rest, and placed\nme also on the ground, when suddenly a great Eagle flew down and carried me\naway. But all the father and mother I ever knew were the two great Eagles.\'\n\n\'Ah, my child! my child!\' cried the Milk-woman, \'I was that poor woman; the\nEagles flew away with my eldest girl when she was only a year old. Have I\nfound you after these many years!\'\n\nAnd she ran and called her children and husband, to tell them the wonderful\nnews.\n\nThen was there great rejoicing among them all.\n\nWhen they were a little calmer, her mother said to Surya Bai, \'Tell us, dear\ndaughter, how your life has been spent since first we lost you.\' And Surya Bai\nwent on--\n\n\'The old Eagles took me away to their home, and there I lived happily many\nyears. They loved to bring me all the most beautiful things they could find,\nand at last one day they both went to fetch me a diamond ring from the Red\nSea; but while they were gone, the fire went out in the nest: so I went to an\nold woman\'s hut, and got her to give me some fire; and next day (I don\'t know\nhow it was), as I was opening the outer door of the cage, a sharp thing that\nwas sticking in it ran into my hand, and I fell down senseless.\n\n\'I don\'t know how long I lay there, but when I came to myself I found the\nEagles must have come back, and thought me dead, and gone away, for the\ndiamond ring was on my little finger; a great many people were watching over\nme, and amongst them was\n\na Rajah, who asked me to go home with him and be his wife,and he brought me to\nthis place, and I was his Ranee.\n\n\'But his other wife, the first Ranee, hated me (for she was jealous), and\ndesired to kill me; and one day she accomplished her purpose, by pushing me\ninto the tank, for I was young and foolish, and disregarded the warnings of my\nfaithful old attendant, who begged me not to go near the place. Ah! if I had\nonly listened to her words I might have been happy still.\'\n\nAt this the old attendant, who had been sitting in the background, rushed\nforward and kissed Surya Bai\'s feet, crying, \'Ah, my lady! my lady! have I\nfound you at last?\' and, without staying to hear more, she ran back to the\nPalace to tell the Rajah the glad news.\n\nThen Surya Bai told her parents how she had not wholly died in the tank, but\nbecome a sunflower; and how the first Ranee, seeing the Rajah\'s fondness for\nthe plant, had caused it to be thrown away; and then how she had risen from\nthe ashes of the sunflower in the form of a mango tree; and how when the tree\nblossomed all her spirit went into the little mango flower; and she ended by\nsaying, \'And when the flower became fruit, I know not by what irresistible\nimpulse I was induced to throw myself into your milk-can, mother. It was my\ndestiny, and as soon as you took me into your house, I began to recover my\nhuman form.\'\n\n"Why, then,\' asked her brothers and sisters, \'do you not tell the Rajah that\nyou are living, and that you are the Ranee Surya Bai?\'\n\n\'Alas!\' she answered, \'I could not do that. Who knows but that he may now be\ninfluenced by the first Ranee, and desire my death? Let me rather be poor like\nyou, but safe from danger.\'\n\nThen her mother cried, \'Oh, what a stupid woman I am! The Rajah one day came\nhere seeking you, but I and your father and brothers drove him away, for we\ndid not know you were indeed the lost Ranee.\'\n\nAs she spoke these words a sound of horses\' hoofs was heard in the distance,\nand the Rajah himself appeared, having learnt the good news of Surya Bai\'s\nbeing alive from her old attendant.\n\nIt is impossible to describe the joy of the Rajah at finding his long-lost\nwife, but it was not greater than Surya Bal\'s at being restored to her\nhusband.\n\nThen the Rajah turned to the old Milk-woman and said, \'Old woman, you did not\ntell me true, for it was indeed my wife who was in your hut\'--\'Yes, Protector\nof the poor,\' answered the old Milk-woman, \'but it was also my daughter.\' Then\nthey told him how Surya Bai was the Milk-woman\'s child.\n\nAt hearing this the Rajah commanded them all to return with him to the Palace.\nHe gave Surya Bai\'s father a village, and ennobled the family; and he said to\nSurya Bai\'s old attendant, \'For the good service you have done, you shall be\nPalace housekeeper;\' and he gave her great riches, adding, \'I can never repay\nthe debt I owe you, nor make you sufficient recompence for having caused you\nto be unjustly cast into prison.\' But she replied, \'Sire, even in your anger\nyou were temperate; if you had caused me to be put to death, as some would\nhave done, none of this good might have come upon you; it is yourself you have\nto thank.\'\n\nThe wicked first Ranee was cast, for the rest of her life, into the prison in\nwhich the old attendant had been thrown; but Surya Bai lived happily with her\nhusband the rest of her days; and in memory of her adventures, he planted\nround their Palace a hedge of sunflowers and a grove of mango trees\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd10.htm#fr_40) See Notes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII.
