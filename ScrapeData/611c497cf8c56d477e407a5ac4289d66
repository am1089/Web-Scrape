Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Twice-born! Indra then remembered Hari and took\nBrihaspati, the Guru of the Devas, to the assembly of Brahma, accompanied by\nthe other Devas. They soon reached the region of Brahma and no sooner they saw\nHim, than Indra and the other Devas and Bihaspati all bowed down to Him.\n\n\n\n3-25. Brihaspati, the \xc3\x82charya of the Devas, then communicated all to Brahma.\nHearing this, He smiled and spoke, addressing Indra :-- O Indra! You have been\nborn in My race; nay, you are My grandson; the \xc3\x82rya Brihaspati is your Guru;\nyou yourself are the ruler of the Devas and you are very wise and sagacious;\nthe mother of your father is the powerful Dak _s_ a, a great Vi _sn_ u Bhakta.\nHow is it, then that when the three sides of the family are pure, one would\nturn out so haughty and arrogant! Whose mother is so much devoted to her\nhusband, whose father, mother\xc2\x92s father and mother\xc2\x92s brother are self-\ncontrolled and of pure Sattva Gu _n_ a, he is not expected to be so very\nhaughty! Every man may be guilty to Hari for the three faults :-- For some\nfault due to that of his father, or of his mother\xc2\x92s father, or of Guru, the\nSpiritual Teacher. Bhagavan Naraya _n_ a, resides in this great holy temple of\nour this physical body controlling the hearts of all. At whatever moment, S\xc2\x92ri\nNaraya _n_ a quits this temple-body, at that moment this body becomes dead. I\nmyself am the mind; S\xc2\x92ankara is the Knowledge, Vi _sn_ u is the vital\n\n\n\np. 966\n\n\n\nbreaths, Bhagavati Durga is the intelligence (Buddhi), sleep, etc., the powers\nof Prakriti; when these are being reflected on by the \xc3\x82tman, Jiva is formed\nwith a body for enjoyment called Bhoga S\xc2\x92arirabhrit. When a king departs, his\nattendants also follow him; so when this \xc3\x82tman departs from this temple of\nbody, his attendants mind, buddhi, etc., instantly depart from this body and\nfollow the \xc3\x82tman. O Indra! We all, are verily, the parts of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. I\nmyself, S\xc2\x92iva, Ananta Deva, Vi _sn_ u, Dharma, Maha Virat, you all are His\nparts and entirely devoted to Him. And you have shown contempt for His flower.\nBhagavan S\xc2\x92ankara, the Lord of the Bhutas, worshipped the lotus-feet of S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a with that flower. The Ri _s_ i Durvasa gave you that flower. But\nyou showed disrespect to it. The flower, Parijata, after being offered at the\nlotus-feet of Kri _sn_ a, should be placed on the head of an Immortal; His\nworship is to be done first; and it is the foremost amongst the Devas. So you\nare now being afflicted by the inevitable course of Fate; Fate is the most\npowerful of all. Who can save that unlucky man against whom Fate has turned?\nSeeing that you have rejected the flower offered to S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, S\xc2\x92ri Lak\n_s_ mi Devi has left you out of anger. Now come with Me and with your family\npriest Brihaspati to Vaiku _nt_ ha and worship the Lord of Lak _s_ mi; then by\nHis grace you may get back your Heavens. Thus saying, Brahma with Indra and\nall the other Devas, went to the Eternal Puru _s_ a, Bhagavan Naraya _n_ a and\nsaw that He was full of Fire and Energy like one hundred ko _t_ i summer\nmidday Suns, yet perfectly cool and calm. He has no beginning, and no end, nor\nany middle. He is Infinite. The four-armed Pari _s_ adas, Sarasvati, the four\nVedas, and the Ganges, all were surrounding Him. Seeing Him, Brahma and the\nother Devas bowed down with devotion and began to chant hymns to Him with\ntears in their eyes. Brahma, then, informed Him of everything when all the\nDevas, dispossessed of their places, began to weep before Him. Naraya _n_ a\nsaw that the Devas were very afraid and much distressed. They had no jewel\nornaments as before, no vehicles (Vahanas), nor the Daivic splendour as\nbefore, not that brillance; always fearful. Then Naraya _n_ a, the Destroyer\nof fear, seeing the Devas in that state, addressed Brahma and the other Devas\n:-- O Brahma _n_! O Devas! Discard all fears. What fear can overcome you? I am\nhere. I will give you again the immoveable prosperous Rajya Lak _s_ mi (the\nLaksmi of the kings).\n\n\n\n26-47. But for the present, I give you some advice proper for this moment.\nListen. There are endless universes where exist innumerable persons. All of\nthem are under Me. So know verily, that\n\n\n\np. 967\n\n\n\nI am under them also. My devotees regard Me as the Highest. They know no other\nthan Me; they are fearless; so I do not remain in that house where My devotees\nare dissatisfied. I instantly quit that house with Lak _s_ mi. Durvasa Ri _s_\ni is born in part of S\xc2\x92ankara. He is highly devoted to Me. He is a pakka Vai\n_sn_ ava. He cursed you and, as a matter of fact, I and Lak _s_ mi instantly\nleft your house.\n\nLak _s_ mi does not reside in that house where conch shells are not blown,\nwhere there are no Tulasi trees, where there is no worship of S\xc2\x92iva and S\xc2\x92iva,\nwhere the Brahma _n_ as are not fed. O Brahma _n_! O Devas! Where I and My\nBhaktas are blamed, Maha Lak _s_ mi becomes greatly displeased. She instantly\ngoes away out of that house. Lak _s_ mi does not stay even for a moment in\nthat house where the stupid person, without any devotion for me, takes his\nfood on the Harivasara Ekadas\xc2\x92i day (the eleventh day of the moon\xc2\x92s wane or\nincrease) or on My anniversary birthday. If anybody sells My name or his own\ndaughter, where the guests are not served, Lak _s_ mi quits that house\ninstantly and goes away.\n\n\n\n(Note :-- That Guru is the Real Guru, who, being capable, imparts the name of\nGod to worthy persons without taking any fee at all.)\n\n\n\nIf the son of an unchaste woman be a Brahma _n_ a, he and the husband of an\nunchaste woman are great sinners. If anybody goes to such a person\xc2\x92s house or\neats the food of a S\xc2\x92udra during a Sraddha ceremony, Lak _s_ mi becomes very\nangry and vacates that house. Being a Brahmi _n_ , if one burns a S\xc2\x92udra\xc2\x92s\ncorpse, one becomes very wretched and the vilest of the Brahmi _n_ s. Lak _s_\nmi never stays for a moment more in that house. Being a Brahmi _n_ , if he be\na S\xc2\x92udra\xc2\x92s cook and drives oxen, Lak _s_ mi fears to drink water there and\nquits his house. Being a Brahmi _n_ , if his heart be unholy, if he be cruel,\nenvies others and blames persons, if he officiates as a priest for the S\xc2\x92udra,\nLak _s_ mi Devi never stays in his house. The World-Mother never stays even\nfor a moment in his house who eats at the house of one who marries an\nunmarried girl twelve years old in whom menstruation has commenced. He who\ncuts grass by his nails, or writes on the ground with his nails, or from whose\nhouse a Brahma _n_ a guest goes back disappointed, Lak _s_ mi never stays in\nhis house. If any Brahma _n_ a eats food at the early sunrise, sleeps during\nthe day or engages in a sexual intercourse during the day, Lak _s_ mi never\nstays in his house. Lak _s_ mi slips away from that Brahma _n_ a who is devoid\nof \xc3\x82chara (rules of conduct), who accepts gifts from S\xc2\x92udras, from him who\nremains uninitiated in his Mantram. The ignorant man who sleeps naked and with\nhis feet wet, who laughs always, and always\n\n\n\np. 968\n\n\n\ntalks at random on disconnected subjects like a mad man, is forsaken at once\nby Lak _s_ mi. Lak _s_ mi becomes angry and goes away from the house of that\nman who applies oil all over his body first and then touches the bodies of\nothers and always makes some sounding noise on several parts of his body. If\nany Brahma _n_ a forsakes observing vows, fastings, the Sandhya ceremony,\npurity and devotion to Vi _sn_ u, Kamala (Lak _s_ mi) does not remain in his\nhouse any longer. If anybody blames always the Brahma _n_ as and shews his\nhatred always towards the Brahma _n_ as, if he does injury to the animals, and\nif he does not indulge in his heart anything of pity, kindness, Lak _s_ mi,\nthe Mother of the Worlds, quits him. O Lotus-born! But where Hari is\nworshipped and Hari\xc2\x92s Name is chanted, Lak _s_ mi, the Mother of all\nauspiciousness, remains there. Lak _s_ mi remains where the glories of S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a and His Bhaktas are sung.\n\n\n\n48-59. Lak _s_ mi always remains there with the greatest gladness where conch-\nshells are blown, where there are conchsells, the S\xc2\x92alagrama stone, the Tulasi\nleaves and the service and meditation of Lak _s_ mi are daily done.\n\n\n\nWhere the phallic emblem of S\xc2\x92iva is worshipped, and His glories sung, where\nS\xc2\x92ri Durga is worshipped and Her glories are sung, Lak _s_ mi, the Dweller in\nthe Lotus, remains there. Where the Brahma _n_ as are honoured and they are\ngladly feasted, where all the Devas are worshiped; the chaste Lak _s_ mi, the\nLotus-faced, remains there. Thus saying to the Devas, the Lord of Lak _s_ mi\nsaid :-- O Devi! Go without any any delay to the K _s_ iroda Ocean and\nincarnate there in part. He then addressed Brahma and said :-- \xc2\x93O Lotus-born!\nYou also better go there and churn the K _s_ iroda Ocean; when Lak _s_ mi will\narise, give her to the Devas.\xc2\x94 O Devar _s_ i! Thus saying, the Lord Kamala\nwent to His inner compartment. On the other hand the Devas, after a long time,\nreached the shores of the K _s_ iroda Ocean. The Devas and the Daityas then\nmade the Golden Mountain (the Sumeru) the churning rod, the Deva Kurma (the\ntortoise), the churning pot and Ananta Deva (the thousand headed serpent) the\nchurning cord and began to churn the ocean. While churning was going on, by\nand by arose Dhanvantari, Amrita (the nectar), the horse Uchchaihs\xc2\x92rava,\nvarious other invaluable jewels that were desired, the elephant Airavata and\nthe beautiful eyed Lak _s_ mi. Vi _sn_ upriya, S\xc2\x92ri Lak _s_ mi Devi, no sooner\nShe got up from the ocean, she, the chaste woman, presented on the neck of\nNaraya _n_ a, of beautiful appearance, the Lord of all, Who slept on the K _s_\niroda ocean the garland (indicative of accepting Him for her bridegroom). Then\nBrahma and Mahes\xc2\x92vara and the other Devas gladly worshipped Her and chanted\nhymns. At this time Lak _s_ mi Devi being pleased, cast a favourable glance\ntowards the homes of the Devas,\n\n\n\np. 969\n\n\n\nin order to free them from their curse. Then, by the grace of Maha Lak _s_ mi\nand by the granting of the boon by Brahma, the Devas got back their own\npossessions from the hands of the Daityas. O Narada! Thus I have described to\nyou the story of Lak _s_ mi Devi, the Essence of all Essences, and very\npleasant to hear. Now what more do you want to hear? Say.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Forty-first Chapter of the Ninth Book on the churning of the\nocean and on the appearing of Lak _s_ mi in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 42](bk09ch42.htm)\n\n'
