[1b](ry022.htm#fn_136)  \nUrge the fleet car, the charger ride;  \nA master he of bowman's skill,  \nJoying to do his father's will.  \nThe world's delight and darling, he  \nLoved Lakshman best from infancy;  \nAnd Lakshman, lord of lofty fate,  \nUpon his elder joyed to wait,  \nStriving his second self to please  \nWith friendship's sweet observances.  \nHis limbs the hero ne'er would rest  \nUnless the couch his brother pressed;  \nExcept beloved Rama shared  \nHe could not taste the meal prepared.  \nWhen Rama, pride of Raghu's race,  \nSprang on his steed to urge the chase,  \nBehind him Lakshman loved to go  \nAnd guard him with his trusty bow.  \nAs Rama was to Lakshman dear  \nMore than his life and ever near,  \nSo fond S'atrughna prized above  \nHis very life his Bharat's love.  \nIllustrious heroes, nobly kind  \nIn mutual love they all combined,  \nAnd gave their royal sire delight  \nWith modest grace and warrior might:  \nSupported by the glorious four  \nShone Das'aratha more and more,  \nAs though, with every guardian,*God  \nWho keeps the land and skies,  \nThe Father of all creatures trod  \nThe earth before men's eyes.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[31:1b](ry021.htm#fr_129) 'The poet no doubt intended to indicate the vernal\nequinox as the birthday of Rama. For the month _Chaitra_ is the first of the\ntwo months assigned to the spring; it corresponds with the latter half of\nMarch and the former half of April in our division of the year. _Aditi_ , the\nmother of the Gods, is lady of the seventh lunar mansion which is called\n_Punarvasu_. The five planets and their positions in the Zodiac are thus\nenumerated by both commentators: the Sun in Aries, Mars in Capricorn, Saturn\nin Libra, Jupiter in Cancer, Venus in Pisces.... I leave to astronomers to\nexamine whether the parts of the description agree with one another, and, if\nthis be the case, thence to deduce the date. The Indians place the nativity of\nRama in the confines of the second age (treta) and the third (dwapara): but it\nseems that this should be taken in an allegorical sense.... We may consider\nthat the poet had an eye to the time in which, immediately before his own age,\nthe aspects of the heavenly bodies were such as he has described.'
