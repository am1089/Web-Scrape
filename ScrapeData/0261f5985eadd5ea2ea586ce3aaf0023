'Of inhalation and exhalation'\xc2\x97(this he says) with a low voice,\n\n5\\. And (the verse), 'Come hither, Indra, with thy lovely-sounding, fallow-\ncoloured (horses)' (Rig-veda III, 45, 1).\n\n6 6. The aged one then murmurs, 'To inhalation and exhalation I, the wide-\nextended one, resort with thee. To the god Savit _ri_ I give thee in\ncharge'\xc2\x97and the verse.\n\n7\\.

On one who has been thus dismissed, danger comes from no side\xc2\x97thus it is\nunderstood (in the _S_ ruti).\n\n9\\. If he hears (on his way) disagreeable voices of birds, he should murmur\nthe two hymns, 'Shrieking, manifesting his being' (Rig-veda II, 42, 43), and\n(the verse), 'The divine voice have the gods created' (Rig-veda VIII, 100,\n11).\n\n10\\.

Naraya _n_ a refers this rule to a student\nwho has performed the Samavartana and wishes to go away. But a comparison of\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya II, 18 seems to make it probable that the ceremony\ndescribed here has nothing to do with the Samavartana.\n\nI take this chapter rather for a description of the way in which a student has\nto take leave of his teacher when setting out on a journey. 'His name' is the\nteacher's name, according to Naraya _n_ a.\n\n[230:2](sbe29143.htm#fr_560) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 18, 1.
