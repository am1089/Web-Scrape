This is because this particular\nBrahmana has passages which discuss aspects of Vedic era sex magic. To fill in\nthe gap, I have appended a 1921 translation of the same Brahmana. This is from\nthe translation of Robert Ernest Hume, and includes English translations of\nthe passages Muller left untranslated. Note that Hume uses a slightly\ndifferent transcription method for Sanskrit than the SBE system.--J. B.

Verily, of created things here earth is the essence; of earth, water; of\nwater, plants; of plants, flowers; of flowers, fruits; of fruits, man ( _puru\n_s_ a_); of man, semen.\n\n2\\. Prajapati ('Lord of creatures') bethought himself: 'Come, let me provide\nhim a firm basis!' So he created woman. When he had created her, he revered\nher below.--Therefore one should revere woman below.--He stretched out for\nhimself that stone which projects. With that he impregnated her.\n\n3\\. Her lap is a sacrificial altar; her hairs, the sacrificial grass; her\nskin, the soma-press. The two labia of the vulva are the fire in the middle.\nVerily, indeed, as great as is the world of him who sacrifices with the\nVajapeya ('Strength-libation') sacrifice, so great is the world of him who\npractises sexual intercourse, knowing this; he turns the good deeds of women\nto himself. But he who practises sexual intercourse without knowing this-women\nturn his good deeds unto themselves.\n\n4\\. This, verily, indeed, it was that Uddalaka \xc3\x82ru\xe1\xb9\x85i knew when he said:--\n\nThis, verily, indeed, it was that Naka Maudgalya knew when he said:--\n\nThis, verily, indeed, it was that Kumaraharita knew when he said: 'Many mortal\nmen, Brahmans by descent, go forth from this world, impotent and devoid of\nmerit, namely those who practise sexual intercourse without knowing this.'\n\n[If] even this much 1 semen is spilled, whether of one asleep or of one awake,\n[5] then he should touch it, or [without touching] repeat:--\n\n'What semen has of mine to earth been spilt now,  \nWhate'er to herb has flowed, whate'er to water--\n\nThis very semen I reclaim!  \nAgain to me let vigor come!  \nAgain, my strength; again, my glow!  \nAgain the altars and the fire  \nBe found in their accustomed place!'\n\n\n\np. 169hume\n\nHaving spoken thus, he should take it with ring-finger and thumb, and rub it\non between his breasts or his eye-brows.\n\n6\\. Now, if one should see himself in water, he should recite over it the\nformula: 'In me be vigor, power, beauty, wealth, merit!'\n\nThis, verily, indeed, is loveliness among women: when she has removed the\nclothes of her impurity. Therefore when she has removed the clothes of her\nimpurity and is beautiful, one should approach and invite her.\n\n7\\. If she should not grant him his desire, he should bribe her. If she still\ndoes not grant him his desire, he should hit her with a stick or with his\nhand, and overcome her, saying: 'With power, with glory I take away your\nglory!' Thus she becomes inglorious.\n\n8\\. If she should yield to him, he says: 'With power, with glory I give you\nglory!' Thus they two become glorious.\n\n9\\. The woman whom one may desire with the thought, 'May she enjoy love with\nme!'--after inserting the member in her, joining mouth with mouth, and\nstroking her lap, he should mutter:--\n\n'Thou that from every limb art come,  \nThat from the heart art generate,  \nThou art the essence of the limbs!  \nDistract this woman here in me,  \nAs if by poisoned arrow pierced!'\n\n10\\. Now, the woman whom one may desire with the thought, 'May she not\nconceive offspring!'--after inserting the member in her and joining mouth with\nmouth, he should first inhale, then exhale, and say: 'With power, with semen,\nI reclaim the semen from you!' Thus she comes to be without seed.\n\n12\\. Now, the woman whom one may desire with the thought, 'May she conceive!'\n--after inserting the member in her and joining mouth with mouth, he should\nfirst exhale, then inhale, and say: 'With power, with semen, I deposit semen\nin you!' Thus she becomes pregnant.\n\n12\\. Now, if one's wife have a paramour, and he hate him, let him put fire in\nan unannealed vessel, spread out a row of reed arrows in inverse order, and\ntherein sacrifice in inverse\n\np. 170hume\n\norder those reed arrows, their heads smeared with ghee, saying:--\n\n'You have made a libation in my fire! I take away your in-breath and out-\nbreath ( _pr a\xe1\xb9\x85apanau_)--you, so-and-so!\n\nYou have made a libation in my fire! I take away your sons and cattle 1\\--you,\nso-and-so!\n\nYou have made a libation in my fire! I take away your sacrifices and\nmeritorious deeds 1\\--you, so-and-so!\n\nYou have made a libation in my fire! I take away your hope and expectation\n1\\--you, so-and-so!'\n\nVerily, he whom a Brahman who knows this curses--he departs from this world\nimpotent and devoid of merit. Therefore one should not desire dalliance with\nthe spouse of a person learned in sacred lore ( _s'rotriya_ ) who knows this,\nfor indeed he who knows this becomes superior. 2\n\n13\\. Now, when the monthly sickness comes upon anyone's wife, for three days\nshe should not drink from a metal cup, nor put on fresh clothes. Neither a\nlow-caste man nor a low-caste woman should touch her. At the end of the three\nnights she should bathe and should have rice threshed.\n\n14\\. In case one wishes, 'That a white son be born to me! that he be able to\nrepeat a Veda! that he attain the full length of life!'--they two should have\nrice cooked with milk and should eat it prepared with ghee. They two are\nlikely to beget [him].\n\n15\\. Now, in case one wishes, 'That a tawny son with reddish-brown eyes be\nborn to me! that he be able to recite two Vedas! that he attain the full\nlength of life!'--they two should have rice cooked with sour milk and should\neat it prepared with ghee. They two are likely to beget [him].\n\n16\\. Now, in case one wishes, 'That a swarthy son with red eyes be born to me!\nthat he be able to repeat three Vedas! that he attain the full length of\nlife!'--they two should have rice boiled with water and should eat it prepared\nwith ghee. They two are likely to beget [him].\n\np. 171hume\n\n17\\. Now, in case one wishes, 'That a learned ( _pa _nd_ ita_) daughter be\nborn to me! that she attain the full length of life!'--they two should have\nrice boiled with sesame and should eat it prepared with ghee. They two are\nlikely to beget [her].\n\nA. Now, in case one wishes, 'That a son, learned, famed, a frequenter of\ncouncil-assemblies, a speaker of discourse desired to be heard, be born to me!\nthat he be able to repeat all the Vedas! that he attain the full length of\nlife!'--they two should have rice boiled with meat and should eat it prepared\nwith ghee. They two are likely to beget [him], with meat, either veal or beef.\n\n19\\. Now, toward morning, having prepared melted butter in the manner of the\nSthalipaka, 1 he takes of the Sthalipaka and makes a libation, saying: 'To\nAgni, hail! To Anumati, 2 hail! To the god Savit _ri_ ('Enlivener,' the Sun),\nwhose is true procreation 3 ( _satya-prasava_ ), hail!' Having made the\nlibation, he takes and eats, Having eaten, he offers to the other [i.e. to\nher]. Having washed his hands, he fills a vessel with water and therewith\nsprinkles her thrice, saying:--\n\n'Arise from hence, Vis'vavasu! 4  \nSome other choicer maiden seek!  \nThis wife together with her lord ----' 5\n\n20\\. Then he comes to her and says:--\n\n'This man ( _ama_ ) am I; that woman ( _s a_), thou!  \nThat woman, thou; this man am I!  \nI am the Saman; thou, the Rig!  \nI am the heaven; thou, the earth!\n\nCome, let us two together clasp!  \nTogether let us semen mix,  \nA male, a son for to procure!'\n\n\n\np. 172hume\n\n21\\. Then he spreads apart her thighs, saying: 'Spread yourselves apart,\nheaven and earth!' Inserting the member in her and joining mouth with mouth,\nhe strokes her three times as the hair lies, saying:--\n\n'Let Vish\xe1\xb9\x85u make the womb prepared!  \nLet Tyash _tr_ i shape the various forms!  \nPrajapati--let him pour in!  \nLet Dhat _r_ i place the germ for thee!\n\nO Sinivali, give the germ;  \nO give the germ, thou broad-tressed dame!  \nLet the Twin Gods implace thy germ--  \nThe Asvins, crowned with lotus-wreaths!\n\n22\\. With twain attrition-sticks of gold  \nThe As'vin Twins twirl forth a flame;  \n'Tis such a germ we beg for thee,  \nIn the tenth month to be brought forth. 1\n\nAs earth contains the germ of Fire ( _agni_ ),  \nAs heaven is pregnant with the Storm ( _indra_ ),  \nAs of the points the Wind ( _v ayu_) is germ,  \nE'en so a germ I place in thee,  \n                        So-and-so!'\n\n23\\. When she is about to bring forth, he sprinkles her with water, saying.--\n\nLike as the wind doth agitate  \nA lotus-pond on every side,  \nSo also let thy fetus stir.  \nLet it come with its chorion.\n\nThis fold of Indra's has been made  \nWith barricade enclosed around.  \nO Indra, cause him to come forth--  \nThe after-birth along with babe!' 2\n\n24\\. When [the son] is born, he [i. e. the father] builds up a fire, places\nhim on his lap, mingles ghee and coagulated milk in a metal dish, and makes an\noblation, ladling out of the mingled ghee and coagulated milk, and saying-\n\np. 173hume\n\n'In this son may I be increased,  \nAnd have a thousand in mine house!  \nMay nothing rob his retinue  \nOf offspring or of animals!  \n              Hail!\n\nThe vital powers (pra _ _n__ a) which are in me, my mind, I offer in you.\n\n              Hail!  \nWhat in this rite I overdid,  \nOr what I have here scanty made--  \nLet Agni, wise, the Prosperer,  \nMake fit and good our sacrifice!  \n              Hail!'\n\n25\\. Then he draws down to the child's right ear and says 'Speech! Speech!'\nthree times. Then he mingles coagulated milk, honey, and ghee and feeds [his\nson] out of a gold [spoon] which is not placed within [the mouth], 1 saying:\n'I place in you _Bh ur_! I place in you _Bhuvas_! I place in you _Svar_! _Bh\nur_, _Bhuvas_ , _Svar_ \\---everything 2 I place in you!'\n\n26\\. Then he gives him a name, saying: 'You are Veda.' 3 So this becomes his\nsecret name. 4\n\n27\\. Then he presents him to the mother and offers the breast, saying:--\n\n'Thy breast which is unfailing and refreshing,  \nWealth-bearer, treasure-finder, rich bestower,  \nWith which thou nourishest all things esteemed--  \nGive it here, O Sarasvati, to suck from. 5'\n\n28\\. Then he addresses the child's mother:--\n\n'You are I _l_ a, 6 of the lineage of Mitra and Varu\xe1\xb9\x85a!  \nO heroine! She has borne a hero!' 7  \nContinue to be such a woman abounding in heroes--  \nShe who has made us abound in a hero!'\n\n\n\np. 174hume\n\nOf such a son, verily, they say: 'Ah, you have gone beyond your father! Ah,\nyou have gone beyond your grandfather!'\n\nAh, he reaches the highest pinnacle of splendor, glory, and sacred knowledge\nwho is born as the son of a Brahman who knows this!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[168hume:1](sbe15098.htm#fr_675) Deictically used.\n\n[170hume:1](sbe15098.htm#fr_678) These same items recur (though not altogether\nverbatim) in Ka _t_ ha I. 9 as possessions of which an offender is to be\ndeprived by an offended Brahman.\n\n[170hume:2](sbe15098.htm#fr_679) This prohibition recurs verbatim in Paraskara\nG _r_ ihya Sutras I. 11. 6; the last phrase also in S'at.
