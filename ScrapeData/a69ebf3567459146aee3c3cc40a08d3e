I gasp for breath,  \nMy swimming sight is dim in death.  \nEven now before my vision pass  \nBright trees of * with hair of grass,  \n*  \nBrings on the thief a flood of woe  \nThe giant in his haste *  \n\n'Twas Vinda's hour,  1 or heeded not.  \nThose robbed at such a time obtain  \nTheir plundered store and wealth again.  \nHe, like a fish that takes the bait,  \nIn briefest time shall meet his fate.  \nNow be thy troubled heart controlled  \nAnd for thy lady's loss consoled.  \nFor thou wilt slay the fiend in fight  \nAnd with thy dame have new delight.'  \n   With senses clear, though sorely tried,  \nThe royal vulture thus replied,  \nWhile as he sank beneath his pain  \nForth rushed the tide of blood again.  \n'Him,  2 brother of the Lord of Gold,  \nVis'ravas' self begot of old.'  \nThus spoke the bird, and stained with gore  \nResigned the breath that came no more.  \n   'Speak, speak again!' thus Rama cried,  \nWith reverent palm to palm applied,  \nBut from the frame the spirit fled  \nAnd to the skiey regions sped.  \nThe breath of life had passed away.  \nStretched on the ground the body lay.  \n   When Rama saw the vulture lie,  \nHupe as a hill, with darksome eye,  \nWith many a poignant woe distressed  \nHis brother chief he thus addressed:  \n'Amid these haunted shades content  \nFull many a year this bird has spent.  \nHis life in home of giants passed,  \nIn Dandak wood he dies at last.  \nThe years in lengthened course have fled  \nUntroubled o'er the vulture's head,  \nAnd now he lies in death, for none  \nThe stern decrees of Fate may shun.  \nSee, Lakshman, how the vulture fell  \nWhile for my sake he battled well.  \nAnd strove to free with onset bold  \nMy Sita from the giant's hold.  \nSupreme amid the vulture kind  \nHis ancient rule the bird resigned.  \nAnd conquered in tho fruitless strife  \nGave for my sake his noble life.  \nO Lakshman, many a time we see  \nGreat souls who keep the law's decree,  \nWith whom the weak sure refuge find,  \nIn creatures of inferior kind.  \nThe kiss of her, my darling queen,  \nStrikes with a pang less fiercely keen  \nThan now this slaughtered bird to see  \nWho nobly fought and died for me.  \nAs Das'aratha, good and great,  \nWas glorious in his high estate,  \nHonoured by all to all endeared,  \nSo was this royal bird revered.  \nBring fuel for the funeral site:  \nThese hands the solemn fire shall light  \n\np. 310  \n\nAnd on the burning pyre shall lay  \nThe bird who died for me to-day.  \nNow on the gathered wood shall lie  \nThe lord of all the birds that fly,  \nAnd I will burn with honours due  \nMy champion whom the giant slew.  \nO royal bird of noblest heart,  \nGraced with all funeral rites depart  \nTo bright celestial seats above,  \nRewarded for thy faithful love.  \nDwell in thy happy home with those  \nWhose constant fires of worship rose.  \nLive blest amid the unyielding brave,  \nAnd those who land in largess gave.  \n   Sore grief upon his bosom weighed  \nAs on the pyre the bird he laid,  \nAnd bade the kindled flame ascend  \nTo burn the body of his friend.  \nThen with his brother by his side  \nThe hero to the forest hied.  \nThere many a stately deer he slew.  \nThe flesh around the bird to strew.  \nThe venison into balls he made.  \nAnd on fair grass before him laid.  \nThen that the parted soul might rise  \nAnd find free passage to the skies,  \nEach solemn word and text he said  \nWhich Brahmans utter o'er the dead.  \nThen hastening went the princely pair  \nTo bright Godayani, and there  \nLibations of the stream they poured  \nIn honour of the vulture lord,  \nWith solemn ritual to the slain,  \nAs scripture's holy texts ordain.  \nThus offerings to the bird they gave  \nAnd bathed their bodies in the wave,  \n   The vulture monarch having wrought  \n   A hard and glorious feat,  \nHonoured by Rama sage in thought,  \n   Soared to his blissful seat.  \nThe brothers, when each rite was paid  \n   To him of birds supreme,  \nTheir hearts with new-found comfort stayed,  \n   And turned them from the stream.  \nLike soveriegns of celestial race  \n   Within the wood they came,  \nEach pondering the means to trace,  \n   The captor of the dame.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[309:1](ry267.htm#fr_514) From the *\n\n[309:2](ry267.htm#fr_515) Ravan\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXX.: Kabandha.](ry268.htm)\n\n"
