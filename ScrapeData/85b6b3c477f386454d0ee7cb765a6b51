Janamejaya said :-- O Muni! How did Ramchandra celebrate the Devi\xc2\x92s Puja,\nthat leads to happiness? Who was He! And how was stolen away His Sita? How was\nHe deprived of His kingdom? Please satisfy me by narrating all these incidents\nto me.\n\n\n\n2\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! There lived, in days of yore, in the city of\nAyodhya, a prosperous king of the solar dynasty named Das\xc2\x92aratha. He always\nworshipped the Devas and Brahma _n_ as.\n\n\n\n3-5. He had four celebrated sons Rama, Lak _s_ ma _n_ a, Bharata and\nSatrughna. These four sons were equally learned and beautiful and they always\ndid actions agreeable to the king. Of these, Ramachandra was the son of the\nQueen Kaus\xc2\x92alya, Bharata was the son of Kaikeyi, and the good looking Lak _s_\nma _n_ a and Satrughna were the twin sons of Sumitra. While young, they\nlearned the art of archery and began to play with bows and arrows in their\nhands.\n\n\n\n6-7. Thus educated and purified, the four sons began to give delight more and\nmore to the king; one day the Mahar _s_ i Vis\xc2\x92vamitra came to Ayodhya and aked\nfrom the king Das\xc2\x92aratha the help of his son Ramachandra for the protection of\nhis sacrificial ceremonies. The king could not cancel the Vis\xc2\x92vamitra's\nrequest and sent with him Rama, accompanied by Lak _s_ ma _n_ a.\n\n\n\np. 235\n\n\n\n8-11. The lovely Rama and Lak _s_ ma _n_ a accompanied the Muni on his way\nback. There lived a terrible looking Rakh _s_ asi, named Ta _d_ aka, in a\nforest on their way, who used to give great troubles to the ascetics; and Rama\nkilled her with only one arrow. Next he killed Subahu and shot arrows at\nanother night-wanderer Maricha and made him senseless, almost dead and threw\nhim at a great distance and thus saved Vis\xc2\x92vamitra from all the obstacles\ntroubling him in his sacrificial ceremonies. Thus fulfilling the great work,\nprotecting the sacrificial ceremonies, Rama, Lak _s_ ma _n_ a and the Muni\nCowsick, the three, started for the kingdom of Mithila. On his way, Rama\nChandra rescued Ahalya from the curse that she was suffering from.\n\n\n\n12-13. At last the two brothers, accompanied by the Muni, reached the city\nVidehanagar. Just at this time the king Janaka of Ayodhya made a vow to give\nin marriage Sita to anybody who will be able to break the bow of S\xc2\x92iva; Rama\nbroke that bow into two and married Sita, born of Lak _s_ mi\xc2\x92s parts. The king\nJanaka gave in, marriage, to Lak _s_ ma _n_ a his own-daughter Urmila.\n\n\n\n14\\. The good and auspicious Bharata and Satrughna married respectively\nMandavi and S\xc2\x92rutakirti, the two daughters of Kus\xc2\x92adhvaja.\n\n\n\n15\\. O king! Thus, in the great city of Mithila, the four brothers performed\ntheir marriage ceremonies, according to the prescribed rules and rites.\n\n\n\n16\\. The king Das\xc2\x92aratha, then seeing Rama well qualified to take charge of\nthe kingdom, proposed to install him on the throne of Ayodhya.\n\n\n\n17\\. The queen Kaikeyi, seeing that various articles were being collected for\nthe installation of Rama, asked for the two boons, promised before, from her\nhusband Das\xc2\x92aratha, who was completely under her control.\n\n\n\n18\\. The first request was her own son, Bharata\xc2\x92s becoming the king of\nAyodhya; and the second request was the banishing of Rama to the forest for\nfourteen years.\n\n\n\n19\\. Thus Ramachandra went accompanied by Sita and Lak _s_ ma _n_ a to the Dan\n_d_ aka forest, frequented by the Rak _s_ asas.\n\n\n\n20\\. The high souled king Das\xc2\x92aratha felt very much due to bereavement of his\nson, remembered the curse given to him by Andhaka Muni and left his mortal\ncoil.\n\n\n\n21\\. Bharata, seeing that his father died solely on, account of his mother,\nrefrained from becoming the king of Ayodhya, the prosperous city and wanted\nthe welfare of his brother Rama.\n\n\n\np. 236\n\n\n\n22\\. Ramachandra went to the forest Pa\xc3\xb1chava _t_ i. One day the youngest\nsister of Rava _n_ a, named Surpanakha became very passionate and came to\nRama; whereon Ramachandra disfigured her by cutting off her nose and ears.\n\n\n\n23\\. Seeing her nose thus cut away, the Rak _s_ asas Khara, Du _s_ a _n_ a,\nand others fought very hard against the powerful Ramachandra.\n\n\n\n24\\. The truly powerful Rama killed Khara, Du _s_ a _n_ a and all other\npowerful Rak _s_ asas, for the welfare of the Munis.\n\n\n\n25\\. Then Surpanakha went to Lanka and informed Rava _n_ a of her nose having\nbeen cut and of the death of Khara, Du _s_ a _n_ a and others.\n\n\n\n26\\. The wicked and malignant Rava _n_ a, hearing of their death, became\nfilled with anger and, mounting on a chariot, quickly went to the forest of\nMaricha.\n\n\n\n27\\. Rava _n_ a expressed his desire to take away Sita; so ordered that\nmagician Maricha to assume the form of a golden deer and go to Rama and entice\nhim away.\n\n\n\n28\\. The magician Maricha assumed the form of a golden deer and reached the\nsight of Janaki. Then that variously spotted deer began to move about near the\nSita Devi.\n\n\n\n29\\. Looking at the beautiful golden splendour of the body of that golden\ndeer, Sita Devi, prompted as it were by the great Fate, spoke to Ramachandra\nlike other independent women \xc2\x93O Lord! Bring me the skin of the deer.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n30\\. Rama too, not judging at all, as if it was the work of Destiny, asked Lak\n_s_ ama _n_ a to remain there and protect Sita, took hold of his bows and\narrows and went after the deer.\n\n\n\n31\\. Infinitely skilled in magic, the deer seeing Hari in the shape of Rama\nsometimes came and sometimes came not within his sight and travelled from one\nforest to another.\n\n\n\n32\\. When Rama saw that He had come very far away from His place, He became\nangry and drew his bow and shot sharp arrows at that deer, the transformed\nMaricha.\n\n\n\n33\\. The deceitful conjuror Rak _s_ asa, being thus shot very violently and\npained intensely, cried out \xc2\x93O brother Lak _s_ ma _n_ a! I am killed\xc2\x94 and\nbreathed his last.\n\n\n\n34-35. This loud awful cry reached Janaki\xc2\x92s ears. She took that voice for\nRama's voice and told to Lak _s_ ma _n_ a in a grieved tone \xc2\x93Lak _s_ ma _n_ a,\ngo quickly. I fear Rama is killed; hear the voice \xc2\x91O Lak _s_ ma _n_ a! come\nquickly and deliver me\xc2\x92 is calling you to go there.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 237\n\n\n\n36\\. Lak _s_ ma _n_ a then replied \xc2\x93Mother! You are alone in this forest;\ntherefore I cannot leave you thus even if Ramchandra be killed.\n\n\n\n37\\. O daughter of Janaka! Rama has ordered me to remain here. Now if I leave\nyou and go elsewhere, then I will be charged with having disobeyed his order.\nFearing that, I am unable to leave this place.\n\n\n\n38\\. It seems to me, moreover, that some magician has carried Rama away from\nhere; I am therefore unable to move a step from here and leave you alone.\n\n\n\n39\\. Hold patience; let me consider; I find no such man as can kill Rama; I am\nunable to leave you by any means alone here and to go away, disobeying Rama\xc2\x92s\norders.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n40\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! Then the young wife of Rama, having handsome\nteeth, began to cry aloud, fearfully, as if made to do so by Destiny, and\nuttered the cruel words to the pure Lak _s_ ma _n_ a.\n\n\n\n41\\. \xc2\x93O son of Sumitra! I know why you are so much attached towards me? I know\nvery well that you have been sent here by Bharata to accompany us simply to\nobtain me.\n\n\n\n42\\. O vile K _s_ attriya, skilled in magic! I am not that sort of woman\nacting to my wanton will; never I will accept you of my will as my husband in\ncase S\xc2\x92ri Ramchandra be dead.\n\n\n\n43\\. In case S\xc2\x92ri Rama does not return, I will certainly commit suicide;\nwithout him I would be very much grieved and afflicted with sorrows; and I\nwould not be able to hold on my life.\n\n\n\n44\\. O Saumitri! Whether you remain here or do not remain, I won\xc2\x92t request\nanything more to you; for I am quite unaware of your mind; but this much I\nlike to say to you, where has your intimacy towards your religious elder\nbrother now gone?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n45-46. Hearing thus the Sita Devi\xc2\x92s words, Lak _s_ ma _n_ a became exceedingly\nsorry; and, being suffocated with heaving sighs on account of the internal\npain told Sita \xc2\x93O! One born from without any womb! Why are you uttering so\ncruel and malignant words; I clearly see when you are speaking such unworthy\nwords, that some great evil is sure to befall on you very soon.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n47\\. O king! Thus saying, the spirited Lak _s_ ma _n_ a left Sita and went out\nweeping very much, and, being very much afflicted with grief, traced the\nfootsteps of his elder and went on in search of him.\n\n\n\n48\\. When Lak _s_ ma _n_ a thus departed, Rava _n_ a entered into the\nhermitage in the guise of a deceitful beggar (Bhik _s_ u wearing a red garb).\n\n\n\np. 238\n\n\n\n49\\. Janaki took that villain Rava _n_ a to be a Yogi and respectfully gave\nhim offerings of worship and forest fruits.\n\n\n\n50-52. That villain asked Sita humbly, in a gentle tone, \xc2\x93O beautiful! Your\neyes are beautiful like Palasa lotus leaves; therefore it seems that you are\nnot an ordinary woman; how is it that you are here thus alone in a wild\nforest? O fair one! Who is your father? who is your brother and who is your\nhusband? Being such a beautiful one, how is it that you are in this forest\nhere like an ordinary woman, dumbfounded? O good looking one! You are worthy\nto live in a palace filled with nectar; why are you living, in this hovel, in\nthis wild forest like an ordinary Muni\xc2\x92s wife, when your beauty is shining in\nlustrous beams like a Deva girl?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n53-55. Vyasa said :-- The daughter of Janaki, hearing the words of Rava _n_ a,\nthe husband of Mandodari, unfortunately took him to be a good Yogi and replied\nin the following way :-- \xc2\x93Perhaps you have heard that a prosperous king\nDas\xc2\x92aratha is reigning in the Ayodhya city. He has four sons; the eldest of\nthese, S\xc2\x92ri Ram Chandra, is my husband. The king offered two boons to Kaikeyi;\ndue to which Ram Chandra has been exiled in this forest and is with his\nbrother Lak _s_ ma _n_ a.\n\n\n\n56\\. I am the daughter of the King Janaka; my name is Sita; Ram Chandra has\nbroken the bow of S\xc2\x92iva and has married me.\n\n\n\n57\\. Resting under his prowess of arms, I am resting here fearlessly in this\nwild forest; seeing a golden deer, he has gone out to kill that for me.\n\n\n\n58\\. Lak _s_ ma _n_ a, too, hearing his voice has gone just now. O Yogi! I am\nliving here depending on the strength of these two brothers.\n\n\n\n59\\. Thus I have told you all about our living in this forest; shortly they\nwill come and worship you duly.\n\n\n\n60-61. The man who has controlled his passions and has become a Yati is like\nVi _sn_ u incarnate; therefore I have worshipped you. O Yogi! Our \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92ram is in\nthe midst of this terrible forest, surrounded by Rakh _s_ asas. Therefore I am\nasking you how is it that you have been able to come here in this dress of\nTrida _nd_ i (a Sannyasi Yogi); please speak in the name of Truth before me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n62\\. Rava _n_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O askance looking one! I am the king of Lanka, the\nhusband of Mandodari. O beautiful one! it is for you that I have put on this\ndress of Yati.\n\n\n\n63\\. O beautiful! My two brothers Khara and Du _s_ a _n_ a have been killed in\nthis forest; and being urged by my sister I have come here.\n\n\n\n64-65. Now leave your this man-husband, residing in the forest as a pauper,\ndevoid of fortune and wealth; and worship me as a husband. O fair one! I am\nRava _n_ a, the king of kings; you now become my lord.\n\n\n\np. 239\n\n\n\n66\\. O daughter of Janaka! I am the lord of the Regents of the quarters; and\nyet I bow my head down to your lotus feet; better accept me and fulfil my\ndesires today.\n\n\n\n67-68. Formerly I asked of you from your father, the king Janaka; but he then\nsaid, that he had laid a pledge, \xc2\x91Whoever will break the S\xc2\x92iva\xc2\x92s bow will\nmarry my daughter.\xc2\x92 The Bhagvan Rudra is my Guru; hence I feared to break his\nbow, and therefore I was not present in your Svayamvara. But from that time my\nmind is always thinking of you and is in a state of bereavement for you.\n\n\n\n69\\. O beautiful one! Hearing now that you are residing in this forest, I,\nimpelled by my previous fascination for you, have now come hither; and you\nbetter now crown my labour with success.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus ends the 28th Chapter on the incidents connected with the Navaratri and\nthe description of Ramaya _n_ am in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18000 verses,\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa in the 3rd Adhyaya.\n\n\n\nNote: The story about the origin of Sita Devi runs thus :-- Rava _n_ a, the\nking of Ceylon (Lanka) practised very severe austerities and got extraordinary\npowers. He brought the three worlds under his subjection, levied taxes from\nall. The Devas and all the other inhabitants of the several worlds paid their\ntaxes, as imposed by Rava _n_ a. Rava _n_ a sent messengers to the Ri _s_ is\nand the Munis, the ascetics, dwelling in forests and asked them to pay their\ntaxes. The Ri _s_ is replied that they had no property. But Rava _n_ a\ninsisted. The Ri _s_ is gave, then, blood, cutting their thighs, in a jar that\nwas carried to Lanka. Rava _n_ a kept that jar under the custody of his queen\nMandodari, and instructed her that the jar contained poison and that she\nshould not eat that. Mandodari, however, ate a portion of that, out of\ncuriosity, and became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter. Fearing Rava _n_\na, she floated the jar with the daughter, in the ocean, which, floating\nthrough oceans and rivers, came and touched the lands of the King Janaka. The\npeasants while tilling, found that and took the girl to the king, who reared\nher as his daughter. Thus Sita, born out of the blood of the Brahma _n_ as,\ntook away subsequently the kingdom, life, and all of Rava _n_ a.\n\n\n\nAnother version is this :-- As before, the messengers advised the Munis to\ngive something; otherwise Rava _n_ a would insist and put them to various\ntroubles. So the Munis cut their thighs and gave blood as their tax, saying\nthat that blood in the jar would cause ruin and desolation to the country\nwhere it will be kept. Rava _n_ a, hearing this, ordered the jar to be carried\nto the kingdom of the king Janaka, thus causing ruin to him. The jar was\nbrought and placed in the fields of Janaka.\n\n\n\np. 240\n\n\n\nNow it happened that there was a very severe drought; rains were absolutely\nwanting; and a dire famine was imminent. The Brahmi _n_ Pundits informed the\nking that if the king and his wife ploughed themselves the fields, rains would\nfall. So the king with his wife did that, the king holding the plough and the\nqueen holding the hand of the king. The fore end of the plough accidentally\nhit upon that jar, out of which came out Sita Devi with two women Riddhi and\nSiddhi, waving chowries on her two sides. The two ladies disappeared and Sita\nDevi looked like a girl. The king Janaka reared her, as if his daughter. Sita\nDevi used to lift daily with her left hand the bow of S\xc2\x92iva, kept in the\nking\xc2\x92s house, and daily worshipped that, and thus cleansed the place. Seeing\nthis, the king Janaka pledged the vow that, whoever would break the S\xc2\x92iva\xc2\x92s\nbow, would marry Sita.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 29](bk03ch29.htm)\n\n"
