In the eighth year after the conception let him initiate a Brahma _n_ a,\n\n2\\. With an antelope-skin,\n\np. 59\n\n3\\. Or in the tenth year after the conception.\n\n4\\. In the eleventh year after the conception a Kshatriya with the skin of a\nspotted deer,\n\n5\\. In the twelfth year after the conception a Vai _s_ ya with a cow-hide.\n\n6\\. Until the sixteenth year the time has not passed for a Brahma _n_ a,\n\n7\\. Until the twenty-second for a Kshatriya,\n\n8\\. Until the twenty-fourth for a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n9 9. After that (time has passed), they become patitasavitrika (men who have\nlost their right of learning the Savitri).\n\np. 60\n\n10\\. Let them not initiate such men,\n\n11\\. Nor teach them,\n\n12\\. Nor perform sacrifices for them,\n\n13\\. Nor have intercourse with them.\n\n14 14. Or (let them initiate students of) all (castes) wearing a (new) garment\nthat has not yet been washed.\n\nAnd wearing a girdle.\n\n15\\. The girdle of a Brahma _n_ a (shall be) made of Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass,\n\n16\\. That of a Kshatriya (shall be) a bowstring,\n\n17\\. That of a Vai _s_ ya a woollen thread.\n\n18\\. The staff of a Brahma _n_ a (shall be) made of Pala _s_ a or of Bilva\nwood,\n\n19\\. That of a Kshatriya of Nyagrodha wood,\n\n20\\. That of a Vai _s_ ya of Udumbara wood.\n\n21 21. That of the Brahma _n_ a shall reach the tip of the nose,\n\n22\\. That of the Kshatriya the forehead,\n\n23\\. That of the Vai _s_ ya the hair.\n\n24\\. Or all (sorts of staffs are to be used) by (men of) all (castes).\n\n25\\. Whatsoever (the student) wears at his initiation, is at the disposal of\nthe teacher.\n\np. 61\n\n26 26. Having had him shaved all round (his head) he should initiate him.\n\n27\\. After (the student) has washed and adorned himself,\n\n28 28. (And) after (the teacher) has sacrificed, both station themselves\nbehind the fire, the teacher with his face turned to the east, the other with\nhis face to the west.\n\n29\\. Let him initiate him standing while (the other also) stands.\n\n30 30. ['The firm, powerful eye of Mitra, glorious splendour, strong and\nprosperous, a chaste, flowing vesture, this skin I put on, a valiant (man).']\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[58:1](sbe29031.htm#fr_120) 1, 1. With regard to the standing terminology of\nthe Upanayana, or the initiation of the student, we may observe that upa-ni\ndoes not mean, as, for instance, Professor Stenzler seems to understand it,\n'to introduce a student to his teacher.' Thus Paraskara's Sutra II, 2, 1, ash\n_t_ avarsha _m_ brahma _n_ am upanayet, &c., is translated by that\ndistinguished scholar, 'Den achtjahrigen Brahma _n_ a soll er (beim Lehrer)\neinfuhren,' &c. (comp. also \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya I, 19, 1). The texts\nclearly point to another translation of upa-ni, for they show that the person\nthat introduces the student (upanayati or upanayate; the middle is used very\nfrequently, for instance, _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a XI, 5, 4, 1; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. II,\nI, 25) is not the father or a relation of the youth who could be supposed to\nlead him to the teacher, but the teacher himself; he introduces (upanayati)\nhim to the brahma _k_ arya, or introduces him with himself, and the student\nenters upon (upaiti) the brahma _k_ arya, or enters with (upaiti) the teacher;\nhe who has thus entered upon studentship, is consequently designated as upeta\n( _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. IV, 8, 1; Paraskara III, 10, 10), and for the initiation, which is\nusually called up an ay an a, occasionally also the word upayana is used (see\nthe Manava-G _ri_ hya I, 22, quoted by Professor Jolly in his article, Das\nDharma-sutra des Vish _n_ u, p. 79). The following passages may be quoted here\nas supporting our opinion on this terminology. At _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a\nXI, 5, 3, 13 _S_ au _k_ eya says to Uddalaka \xc3\x82ru _n_ i, 'I will enter (as a\nstudent) with the reverend One' (upayani bhagavantam); and \xc3\x82ru _n_ i replies,\n'Come, enter (with me)!' (ehy upehi), 'and he initiated him' (ta _m_\nhopaninye). Ibid. XI, 5, 4, 16 it is stated that according to some a teacher\nwho has initiated a Brahma _n_ a as a student (brahma _n_ a _m_ brahma _k_\naryam upaniya) should abstain from sexual intercourse, for a student who\nenters upon studentship (yo brahma _k_ aryam upaiti) becomes, as it were, a\ngarbha, &c. Finally we may add that the Buddhist terminology regarding the\nentering into the order or upon a life of righteousness is clearly connected\nwith that followed, for instance, in the dialogue between p. 59 _S_ au _k_ eya\nand \xc3\x82ru _n_ i. As _S_ au _k_ eya there says, upayani bhagavantam, we\nfrequently read in the Pali books expressions like this, upemi Buddha _m_ sara\n_n_ a _m_ dhamma _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ api anuttara _m_ , &c. (Dhammap. A _t_ _th_ akatha,\np. 97, ed. Fausboll), and as \xc3\x82ru _n_ i replies, ehy upehi, Buddha says to\nthose who wish to be ordained, ehi bhikkhu, svakkhato dhammo, _k_ ara brahma\n_k_ ariya _m_ , &c. (Mahavagga I, 6, 32, &c.; S.B.E., vol. xiii, p. 74, note).\n\nThe counting of the years not from the birth but from the conception occurs\nboth in the Brahmanical and in the Buddhist ordinances, comp. H. O., Buddha,\nsein Leben, seine Lehre, seine Gemeinde, p. 354, note 1. Several G _ri_ hya\ntexts (for instance, \xc3\x82 _s_ v. I, 19, 1. 2) admit both ways of counting the\nyears. The number of years given for the Upanayana of persons of the three\ncastes (Brahma _n_ as 8-16, Kshatriyas 11-22, Vai _s_ yas 12-24) is evidently\nderived from the number of syllables of the three metres which are so very\nfrequently stated to correspond to the three castes, to the three gods or\ncategories of gods (Agni, Indra, Vi _s_ ve devas) &c., viz. the Gayatri, the\nTrish _t_ ubh, and the _G_ agati. This is a very curious example, showing how\nin India phantastical speculations like those regarding the mystical qualities\nof the metres, were strong enough to influence the customs and institutions of\nreal life.\n\n[59:9](sbe29031.htm#fr_121) 9 seq. All these are standing expressions\nrecurring nearly identically in most of the G _ri_ hya and Dharma-sutras. In\nthe rule contained in Sutra 13 a number of the parallel texts have vivaheyu\n_h_ or vivahayeyu _h_ , others have vyavahareyu _h_. Comp. Vasish _th_ a XI,\n75; Indische Studien, vol. x, p. 21.\n\n[60:14](sbe29031.htm#fr_122) This Sutra should rather be divided into two, as\nindicated in the translation. As to the mekhala (girdle) comp. below, chap. 2,\n1.\n\n[60:21](sbe29031.htm#fr_123) There is no doubt that pra _n_ asammito (which\nNaraya _n_ a explains thus, 'pra _n_ a is the wind [or breath]; [the staff\nshould] reach to the place where the wind leaves the body, i.e. to the tip of\nthe nose') should either be corrected into, or explained as, ghra _n_\nasammito; the _S_ ambavya MS. has ghra _n_ antiko brahma _n_ asya. Comp.\nGautama I, 26, &c. The parallel texts agree in assigning the longer staff to\nthe higher, not as _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana does, to the lower caste.\n\n[61:26](sbe29031.htm#fr_124) After the introductory remarks given in the\npreceding Sutras the ritual itself of the Upanayana is now described.\n\n[61:28](sbe29031.htm#fr_125) Naraya _n_ a: hutva\xc2\x92nade _s_ aparibhashata _h_\n(see above, I, 12, 13) purastatsa _m_ _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aka _m_ hutva agni _m_\nsthapitagni _m_ (see above, I, 5, 2) _g_ aghanena . . . tish _th_ ata _h_.\n\n[61:30](sbe29031.htm#fr_126) This Sutra is wanting in most of the MSS. (see\nthe note, p. 48 of the German edition). It contains the Mantra with which the\nA _g_ ina (the hide mentioned in Sutras 2, 4, 5 of this chapter) is put on.\nNaraya _n_ a gives the Mantra which he says is taken from the Madhyandina-G\n_ri_ hya (in the Paraskara-G _ri_ hya it is not found), after chap. 2, 3, and\nhe states that the corresponding act to which it belongs has its place after\nthe rites concerning the girdle (chap. 2, 1) and the sacrificial cord (2, 3).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2](sbe29032.htm)\n\n"
