High fate be thine,  \nThou scion of a royal line.  \nNow will I, for I love thee so,  \nAll heavenly arms on thee bestow.  \nVictor with these, whoe'er oppose,  \nThy hand shall conquer all thy foes,  \nThough Gods and spirits of the air,  \nSerpents and fiends, the conflict dare.  \nI'll give thee as a pledge of lore  \nThe mystic arms they use above,  \nFor worthy thou to have revealed  \nThe weapons I have learnt to wield.  \n\np. 42  \n\nFirst, son of Raghu, shall be thine  \nThe arm of Vengeance, strong, divine:  \nThe arm of Fate, the arm of Right,  \nAnd Vishnu's arm of awful might:  \nThat, before whioh no foe can stand,  \nThe thunderbolt of Indra's hand;  \nAnd S'iva's trident, sharp and dread,  \nAnd that dire weapon Brahma's Head,  \nAnd two fair clubs, O royal child,  \nOne Charmer and one Pointed styled  \nWith flame of lambent fire aglow,  \nOn thee, O Chieftain, I bestow.  \nAnd Fate's dread net and Justice' noose  \nThat none may conquer, for thy use:  \nAnd the great cord, renowned of old,  \nWhich Varun ever loves to hold.  \nTake these two thunderbolts, which I  \nHave got for thee, the Moist and Dry,  \nHere S'iva's dart to thee I yield,  \nAnd that which Vishnu wont to wield.  \nI give to thee the arm of Fire,  \nDesired by all and named the Spire.  \nTo thee I grant the Wind-God's dart,  \nNamed Crusher, O thou pure of heart.  \nThis arm, the Horse's Head, accept,  \nAnd this, the Curlew's Bill yclept,  \nAnd these two spears, the best e'er flew,  \nNamed the Invincible and True.  \nAnd arms of fiends I make thine own,  \nSkull-wreath and mace that smashes bone.  \nAnd Joyous, whioh the spirits bear,  \nGreat weapon of the sons of air.  \nBrave offspring of the best of lords,  \nI give thee now the Gem of swords,  \nAnd offer next, thine hand to arm,  \nThe heavenly bards' beloved charm.  \nNow with two arms I thee invest  \nOf never-ending Sleep and Rest,  \nWith weapons of the Sun and Rain,  \nAnd those that dry and burn amain;  \nAnd strong Desire with conquering touch,  \nThe dart that Kama prizes much.  \nI give the arm of shadowy powers  \nThat bleeding flesh of men devours.  \nI give the arms the God of Gold  \nAnd giant fiends exult to hold.  \nThis smites the foe in battle-strife,  \nAnd takes his fortune, strength, and life.  \nI give the arms called False and True,  \nAnd great Illusion give I too;  \nThe hero's arm called Strong and Bright  \nThat spoils the foeman's strength in fight.  \nI give thee as a priceless boon  \nThe Dew, the weapon of the Moon,  \nAnd add the weapon, deftly planned,  \nThat strengthens Vis'vakarma's hand.  \nThe Mortal dart whose point is chill,  \nAnd Slaughter, ever sure to kill;  \nAll these and other arms, for thou  \nArt very dear, I give thee now.  \nReceive these weapons from my hand,  \nSon of the noblest in the land.'  \n\nFacing the east, the glorious saint  \nPure from all spot of earthly taint,  \nTo Rama, with delighted mind,  \nThat noble host of spells consigned.  \nHe taught the arms, whose lore is won  \nHardly by Gods, to Raghu's son.  \nHe muttered low the spell whose call  \nSummons those arms and rules them all  \nAnd, each in visible form and frame,  \nBefore the monarch's son they came.  \nThey stood and spoke in reverent guise  \nTo Rama with exulting cries:  \n'O noblest child of Raghu, see,  \nThy ministers and thralls are we.'  \n   With joyful heart and eager hand  \nRama received the wondrous band,  \nAnd thus with words of welcome cried:  \n'Aye present to my will abide.'  \nThen hasted to the saint to pay  \nDue reverence, and pursued his way.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[41:1](ry030.htm#fr_163) The famous pleasure-garden of Kuvera the God of\nWealth.\n\n[41:2](ry031.htm#fr_164) 'The whole of this Canto together with the following\none, regards the belief, formerly prevalent in India, that by virtue of\ncertain spells, to be learnt and muttered, secret knowledge and superhuman\npowers might be acquired. To this the poet has already alluded in Canto xxiii.\nThese incorporeal weapons are partly represented according to the fashion of\nthose ascribed to the Gods and the different orders of demi-gods, partly are\nthe mere creations of fancy; and it would not be easy to say what idea the\npoet had of them in his own mind, or what powers he meant to assign to each.'\nSCHLEGEL.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXX.: The Mysterious Powers.](ry032.htm)\n\n"
