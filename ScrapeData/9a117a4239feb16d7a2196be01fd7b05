Such a beautiful boy as he will be has never been seen. He\nwill have a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin." Then her playfellows\nused to laugh at her and mock her.\n\nBut one day the King heard her telling them about the beautiful boy she would\nhave when she was married, and he said to himself he should like very much to\nhave such a son; the more so that though he had already four Queens he had no\nchild. He went, therefore, to the gardener and told him he wished to marry his\ndaughter. This delighted the gardener and his wife, who thought it would\nindeed be grand for their daughter to become a princess. So they said "Yes" to\nthe King, and invited all their friends to the wedding. The King invited all\nhis, and he gave the gardener as much money as he wanted. Then the wedding was\nheld with great feasting and rejoicing.\n\nA year later the day drew near on which the gardener\'s daughter was to have\nher son; and the King\'s four other Queens came constantly to see her. One day\nthey said to her, "The King hunts every day; and the time is soon coming when\nyou will have your child. Suppose you fell ill whilst he was out hunting and\ncould therefore know nothing of your illness, what would you do then?"\n\nWhen the King came home that evening, the gardener\'s daughter said to him,\n"Every day you go out hunting. Should I ever be in trouble or sick while you\nare away, how could I send for you?" The King gave her a kettle-drum which he\nplaced near the door for her, and he said to her, "Whenever you want me, beat\nthis kettle-drum. No matter how far away I may be, I shall hear it, and will\ncome at once to you."\n\nNext morning when the King had gone out to hunt, his four other Queens came to\nsee the gardener\'s daughter. She told them all about her kettle-drum. "Oh,"\nthey said, "do drum on it just to see if the King really will come to you."\n\n"No, I will not," she said; "for why should I call him from his hunting when I\ndo not want him?"\n\n"Don\'t mind interrupting his hunting," they answered. "Do try if he really\nwill come to you when you beat your kettle-drum." So at last, just to please\nthem, she beat it, and the King stood before her.\n\n"Why have you called me?" he said. "See, I have left my hunting to come to\nyou."\n\n"I want nothing," she answered; "I only wished to know if you really would\ncome to me when I beat my drum."\n\n"Very well," answered the King; "but do not call me again unless you really\nneed me." Then he returned to his hunting.\n\nThe next day; when the King had gone out hunting as usual, the four Queens\nagain came to see the gardener\'s daughter. They begged and begged her to beat\nher drum once more, "just to see if the King will really come to see you this\ntime." At first she refused, but at last she consented. So she beat her drum,\nand the King came to her. But when he found she was neither ill nor in\ntrouble, he was angry, \'and said to her, "Twice I have left my hunting and\nlost my game to come to you when you did not need me. Now you may call me as\nmuch as you like, but I will not come to you," and then be went away in a\nrage.\n\nThe third day the\' gardener\'s daughter fell ill, and she beat and beat her\nkettle-drum; but the King never came. He heard her kettle-drum, but he\nthought, "She does not really want me; she is only trying to see if I will go\nto her."\n\nMeanwhile the four other Queens came to her, and they said, "Here it is the\ncustom before a child is born to bind its mother\'s eyes with a handkerchief\nthat she may not see it just at first. So let us bind your eyes." She\nanswered, "Very well, bind my eyes." The four wives then tied a handkerchief\nover them.\n\nSoon after, the gardener\'s daughter had a beautiful little son, with a moon on\nhis forehead and a star on his chin, and before the poor mother had seen him,\nthe four wicked Queens took the boy to the nurse and said to her, "Now you\nmust not let this child make the least sound for fear his mother should hear\nhim; and in the night you must either kill him, or else take him away, so that\nhis mother may never see him. If you obey our orders, we will give you a great\nmany rupees." All this they did out of spite. The nurse took the little child\nand put him into a box, and the four Queens went back to the gardener\'s\ndaughter.\n\nFirst they put a stone into her boy\'s little bed, and then they took the\nhandkerchief off her eyes and showed it her, saying, "Look! this is your son!"\nThe poor girl cried bitterly, and thought, "What will the King say when he\nfinds no child?" But she could do nothing. When the King came home, he was\nfurious at hearing his youngest wife, the gardener\'s daughter, had given him a\nstone instead of the beautiful little son she had promised him. He made her\none of the palace servants, and never spoke to her.\n\nIn the middle of the night the nurse took the box in which was the beautiful\nlittle prince, and went out to a broad plain in the jungle. There she dug a\nhole, made the fastenings of the box sure, and put the box into the hole,\nalthough the child in it was still alive. The King\'s dog, whose name was\nShankar, had followed her to see what she did with the box. As soon as she had\ngone back to the four Queens (who gave her a great many rupees), the dog went\nto the hole in which she had put the box, took the box out, and opened it.\nWhen he saw the beautiful little boy, he was very much delighted and said, "If\nit pleases Khuda that this child should live, I will not hurt him; \'I will not\neat him, but I will swallow him whole and hide him in my stomach." This he\ndid.\n\nAfter six months had passed, the dog went by night to the jungle, and thought,\n"I wonder whether the boy is alive or dead." Then he brought the child out of\nhis stomach and rejoiced over his beauty. The boy was now six months old. When\nShankar had caressed and loved him, he swallowed him again for another six\nmonths. At the end of that time he went once more by night to the broad\njungle-plain. There he brought up the child out of his stomach (the child was\nnow a year old); and caressed and petted him a great deal, and was made very\nhappy by his great beauty.\n\nBut this time the dog\'s keeper had followed and watched the dog; and he saw\nall that Shankar did, and the beautiful little child, so he ran to the four\nQueens and said to them, "Inside the King\'s dog there is a child! the\nloveliest child! He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin. Such a\nchild has never been seen!" At this the four wives were very much frightened,\nand as soon as the King came home from hunting they said to him, "While you\nwere away your dog came to our rooms, and tore our clothes and knocked about\nall our things. We are afraid he will kill us." "Do not be afraid," said the\nKing. Eat your dinner and be happy. I will have the dog shot to-morrow\nmorning."\n\nThen he ordered his servants to shoot the dog at dawn, but the dog heard him,\nand said to himself, "What shall I do? The King intends to kill me. I don\'t\ncare about that, but what will become of the child if I am killed? He will\ndie. But I will see if I cannot save him."\n\nSo when it was night, the dog ran to the King\'s cow, who was called Suri, and\nsaid to her, "Suri, I want to give you something, for the King has ordered me\nto be shot tomorrow. Will you take great care of whatever I give you?"\n\n"Let me see what it is," said Suri, "I will take care of it if I can." Then\nthey both went together to the wide plain, and there the dog brought up the\nboy. Suri was enchanted with him. "I never saw such a beautiful child in this\ncountry," she said. "See, he has a moon on his forehead and a star on his\nchin. I will take the greatest care of him." So saying she swallowed the\nlittle prince. The dog made her a great many salaams, and said, "To-morrow I\nshall die;" and the cow then went back to her stable.\n\nNext morning at dawn the dog was taken to the jungle and shot.\n\nThe child now lived in Suri\'s stomach; and when one whole year had passed, and\nhe was two years old, the cow went out to the plain, and said to herself, "I\ndo not know whether the child is alive or dead. But I have never hurt it, so I\nwill see." Then she brought up the boy; and he played about, and Suri was\ndelighted; she loved him and caressed him, and talked to him. Then she\nswallowed him, and returned to her stable.\n\nAt the end of another year she went again to the plain and brought up the\nchild. He played and ran about for an hour to her great delight, and she\ntalked to him and caressed him. His great beauty made her very happy. Then she\nswallowed him once more and returned to her stable. The child was now three\nyears old.\n\nBut this time the cowherd had followed Suri, and had seen the wonderful child\nand all she did to it. So he ran and told the four Queens, "The King\'s cow has\na beautiful boy inside hen. He has a moon on his. forehead and a star on his\nchin. Such a child has never been seen before!"\n\nAt this the Queens were terrified. They tore their clothes and their hair and\ncried. When the King came home at evening, he asked them why they were so\nagitated. "Oh," they said, "your cow came and tried to kill us; but we ran\naway. She tore our hair and our clothes." "Never mind," said the King. "Eat\nyour dinner and be happy. The cow shall be killed to-morrow morning."\n\nNow Suri heard the King give this order to the servants, so she said to\nherself, "What shall I do to save the child?" When it was midnight, she went,\nto the King\'s horse called Katar, who was very wicked, and quite untamable. No\none had ever been able to ride him; indeed no one could go near him with\nsafety, he was so savage. Suri said to this horse, "Katar, will you take care\nof something that I want to give you, because the King has ordered me to be\nkilled to-morrow?"\n\nGood," said Katar; "show me what it is." Then Suri brought up the child, and\nthe horse was delighted with him. "Yes," he said, "I will take the greatest\ncare of him. Till now no one has been able to ride me, but this child shall\nride me." Then he swallowed the boy, and when he had done so, the cow made him\nmany salaams, saying, "It is for this boy\'s sake that I am to die." The next\nmorning she was taken to the jungle and there killed.\n\nThe beautiful boy now lived in the horse\'s stomach, and he stayed in it for\none whole year. At the end of that time the horse thought, "I will see if this\nchild is alive or dead." So he brought him up; and then he loved him, and\npetted him, and the little prince played all about the stable, out of which\nthe horse was never allowed to go. Katar was very glad to see the child, who\nwas now four years old. After be had played for some time, the horse swallowed\nhim again. At the end of another year, when the boy was five years old, Katar\nbrought him up again, caressed him, loved him, and let him play about the\nstable as he had done a year before. Then the horse swallowed him again.\n\nBut this time the groom had seen all that happened, and when it was morning,\nand the King had gone away to his hunting, he went to the four wicked Queens,\nand told them all he had seen, and all about the wonderful, beautiful child\nthat lived inside the King\'s horse Katar. On hearing the groom\'s story the\nfour Queens cried, and tore their hair and clothes, and refused to eat. When\nthe King returned at evening and asked them why they were so miserable, they\nsaid, "Your horse Katar came and tore our clothes, and upset all our things,\n\'and we ran away for fear he should kill us."\n\n"Never mind," said the King. "Only eat your dinner and be happy. I will have\nKatar shot to-morrow." Then he thought that two men unaided could not kill\nsuch a wicked horse, so he ordered his servants to bid his troop of sepoys\nshoot him.\n\nSo the next day the King placed his sepoys all round the stable, and he took\nup his stand with them; and he said he would himself shoot any one who let his\nhorse escape.\n\n[![](tn/63.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/63.jpg)\n\nMeanwhile the horse had overheard all these orders. So he brought up the child\nand said to him, "Go into that little room that leads out of the stable, and\nyou will find in it a saddle and bridle which you must put on me. Then you\nwill find in the room some beautiful clothes such as princes wear; these must\nyou put on yourself; and you must take the sword and gun you will find there\ntoo. Then you must mount on my back." Now Katar was a fairy-horse, and came\nfrom the fairies\' country, so he could get anything he wanted; but neither the\nKing nor any of his people knew this. When all was ready, Katar burst out of\nhis stable, with the prince on his back, rushed past the King himself before\nthe King had time to shoot him, galloped away to the great jungle-plain, and\ngalloped about all over it. The King saw his horse had a boy on his back,\nthough be could not see the boy distinctly. The sepoys tried in vain to shoot\nthe horse; he galloped much too fast; and at last they were all scattered over\nthe plain. Then the King had to give it up and go home; and the sepoys went to\ntheir homes. The King could not shoot any of his sepoys for letting his horse\nescape, for he himself had let him do so.\n\nThen Katar galloped away, on, and on, and oil; and when night came they stayed\nunder a tree, he and the King\'s son. The horse ate grass, and the boy wild\nfruits which he found in the jungle. Next morning they started afresh, and\nwent far, and far, till they came to a jungle in another country, which did\nnot belong to the little prince\'s father,but to another king. Here Katar said\nto the boy, "Now get off my back." Off jumped the prince. "Unsaddle me and\ntake off my bridle; take off your beautiful clothes and tie them all up in a\nbundle with your sword and gun." This the boy did. Then the horse gave him\nsome poor, common clothes, which he told him to put on. As soon as he was\ndressed in them the horse said, "Hide your bundle in this grass, and I will\ntake care of it for you. I will always stay in this jungle-plain, so that when\nyou want me you will always find me. You must now go away and find service\nwith some one in this country."\n\nThis made the boy very sad. I know nothing about anything," he said. "What\nshall I do all alone in this country?"\n\n"Do not be afraid," answered Katar. "You will find service, and I will always\nstay here to help you when you want me. So go, only before you go, twist my\nright ear." The boy did so, and his horse instantly became a donkey. "Now\ntwist your right ear," said Katar. And when the boy had twisted it, he was no\nlonger a handsome prince, but a poor, common-looking, ugly man; and his moon\nand star were hidden.\n\nThen he went away further into the country, until he came to a grain merchant\nof the country, who asked him who he was. "I am a poor man," answered the boy,\n"and I want service." "Good," said the grain merchant, "you shall be my\nservant."\n\nNow the grain merchant lived near the King\'s palace, and one night at twelve\no\'clock the boy was very hot; so he went out into the King\'s cool garden, and\nbegan to sing a lovely song. The seventh and youngest daughter of the King\nheard him, and she wondered who it was who could sing so deliciously. Then she\nput on her clothes, rolled up her hair, and came down to where the seemingly\npoor common man was lying singing. "Who are you? where do you come from?" she\nasked.\n\nBut he answered nothing.\n\n"Who is this man who does not answer when I speak to him?" thought the little\nprincess, and she went away. On the second night the same thing happened, and\non the third night too. But on the third night, when she found she could not\nmake him answer her, she said to him: "What a strange man you are not to\nanswer me when I speak to you." But still he remained silent, so she went\naway.\n\nThe next day. when he had finished his work, the young prince went to the\njungle to see his horse, who asked him, "Are you quite well and happy?" "Yes,\nI am," answered the boy. "I am servant to a grain merchant. The last three\nnights I have gone into the King\'s garden and sung a song, and each night the\nyoungest princess has come to me and asked me who I am, and whence I came, and\nI have answered nothing. What shall I do now?" The horse said, "Next time she\nasks you who you are, tell her you are a very poor man, and came from your own\ncountry to find service here?"\n\nThe boy then went home to the grain merchant, and at night, when every one had\ngone to bed, he went to the King\'s garden and sang his sweet song again. The\nyoungest princess heard him, got up, dressed, and came to him. "Who are you?\nWhence do you come?" she asked.\n\n"I am a very poor man," he answered. "I came from my own country to seek\nservice here, and I am now one of the grain merchant\'s servants." Then she\nwent away. For three more nights the boy sang in the King\'s garden, and each\nnight the princess came and asked him the same questions as before, and the\nboy gave her the same answers.\n\nThen she went to her father, and said to him, "Father, I wish to be married;\nbut I must choose my husband myself." Her father consented to this, and he\nwrote and invited all the Kings and Rajas in the land, saying, "My youngest\ndaughter wishes to be married, but she insists on choosing her husband\nherself. As I do not know who it is she wishes to marry, I beg you will all\ncome on a certain day, for her to see you and make her choice."\n\nA great many Kings, Rajas, and their sons accepted this invitation and came.\nWhen they had all arrived, the little princess\'s father said to them, "To-\nmorrow morning you must all sit together in my garden" (the King\'s garden was\nvery large), "for then my youngest daughter will come and see you all, and\nchoose her husband. I do not know whom she will choose."\n\nThe youngest princess ordered a grand elephant to be ready for her the next\nmorning, and when the morning came, and all was ready, she dressed herself in\nthe most lovely clothes, and put on her beautiful jewels; then she mounted her\nelephant, which was painted blue. In her hand she took a gold necklace.\n\nThen she went into the garden where the Kings, Rajas, and their sons were\nseated. The boy, the grain merchant\'s servant, was also in the garden: not as\na suitor, but looking on with the other servants.\n\nThe princess rode all round the garden, and looked at all the Kings and Rajas\nand princes, and then she hung the gold necklace round the neck of the boy,\nthe grain merchant\'s servant. At this everybody laughed, and the Kings were\ngreatly astonished. But then they and the Rajas said, "What fooling is this?"\nand they pushed the pretended poor man away, and took the necklace off his\nneck, and said to him, "Get out of the way, you poor, dirty man. Your clothes\nare far too dirty for you to come near us!" The boy went far away from them,\nand stood a long way off to see what would happen.\n\nThen the King\'s youngest daughter went all round the garden again, holding her\ngold necklace in her hand, and once more she hung it round the boy\'s neck.\nEvery one laughed at her and said, "How can the King\'s daughter think of\nmarrying this poor, common man!" and the Kings and the Rajas, who had come as\nsuitors, all wanted to turn him out of. the garden. But the princess said,\n"Take care! take care! You must not turn him out. Leave him alone." Then she\nput him on her elephant, and took him to the palace.\n\nThe Kings and Rajas and their sons were very much astonished, and said, "What\ndoes this mean? The princess does not care to marry one of us, but chooses\nthat very poor man!" Her father then stood up, and said to them all, I\npromised my daughter she should marry any one she pleased, and as she has\ntwice chosen that poor, common man, she shall marry him." And so the princess\nand the boy were married with great pomp and splendour: her father and mother\nwere quite content with her choice; and the Kings, the Rajas and their sons,\nall returned to their homes.\n\nNow the princess\'s six sisters had all married rich princes, and they laughed\nat her for choosing such a poor ugly husband as hers seemed to be, and said to\neach other, mockingly, "See! our sister has married this poor, common man!"\nTheir six husbands used to go out hunting every day, and every evening they\nbrought home quantities of all kinds of game to their wives, and the game was\ncooked for their dinner and for the King\'s; but the husband of the youngest\nprincess always stayed at home in the palace, and never went out hunting at\nall. This made her very sad, and she said to herself," My sisters\' husbands\nhunt every day, but my husband never hunts at all."\n\nAt last she said to him, "Why do you never go out hunting as my sisters\'\nhusbands do every day, and every day they bring home quantities of all kinds\nof game? Why do you always stay at home, instead of doing as they do?"\n\nOne day he said to her, "I am going out to-day to eat the air."\n\n"Very good," she answered; "go, and take one of the horses."\n\n"No," said the young prince, "I will not ride, I will walk." Then he went to\nthe jungle-plain where he had left Katar, who all this time had seemed to be a\ndonkey, and he told Katar everything. "Listen," he said; "I have married the\nyoungest princess; and when we were married everybody laughed at her for\nchoosing me, and said, \'What a very poor, common man our princess has chosen\nfor her husband!\' Besides, my wife is very sad, for her six sisters\' husbands\nall hunt every day, and bring home quantities of game, and their wives\ntherefore are very proud of them. But I stay at home all day, and never hunt.\nTo-day I should like to hunt very much,"\n\n"Well," said Katar, "then twist my left ear;" and as soon as the boy had\ntwisted it, Katar was a horse again, and not a donkey any longer. "Now," said\nKatar, "twist your left ear, and you will see what a beautiful young prince\nyou will become." So the boy twisted his own left ear, and there he stood no\nlonger a poor, common, ugly man, but a grand young prince with a moon on his\nforehead and a star on his chin. Then he put on his splendid clothes, saddled\naud bridled Katar, got on his back with his sword and gun, and rode off to\nhunt.\n\nHe rode very far, and shot a great many birds and a quantity of deer. That day\nhis six brothers-in-law could find no game, for the beautiful young prince had\nshot it all. Nearly all the day long these six princes wandered about looking\nin vain for game; till at last they grew hungry and thirsty, and could find no\nwater, and they had no food with them. Meanwhile the beautiful young prince\nhad sat down under a tree, to dine and rest, and there his six brothers-in-law\nfound him. By his side was some delicious water, and also some roast meat.\n\nWhen they saw him the six princes said to each other, "Look at that handsome\nprince. He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin. We have never\nseen such a prince in this jungle before; he must come from another country."\nThen they came up to him, and made him many salaams, and begged him to give\nthem some food and water. "Who are you?" said the young prince. "We are the\nhusbands of the six elder daughters of the King of this country," they\nanswered; "and we have hunted all day, and are very hungry and thirsty." They\ndid not recognise their brother-in-law in the least.\n\n"Well," said the young prince, "I will give you something to eat and drink if\nyou will do as I bid you." "We will do all you tell us to do," they answered,\n"for if we do not get water to drink, we shall die." "Very good," said the\nyoung prince. "Now you must let me put a red-hot pice on the back of each of\nyou, and then I will give you food and water. Do you agree to this?" The six\nprinces consented, for they thought, "No one will ever see the mark of the\npice, as it will be covered by our clothes; and we shall die if we have no\nwater to drink." Then the young prince took six pice, and made them red-hot in\nthe fire; he laid one on the back of each of the six princes, and gave them\ngood food and water. They ate and thank; and when they had finished they made\nhim many salaams and went home.\n\nThe young prince stayed under the tree till it was evening; then he mounted\nhis horse and rode off to the King\'s palace. All the people looked at him as\nhe came riding along, saying, "What a splendid young prince that is! He has a\nmoon on his forehead and a star on his chin." But no one recognised him. When\nhe came near the King\'s palace, all the King\'s servants asked him who he was;\nand as none of them knew him, the gate-keepers would not let him pass in. They\nall wondered who he could be, and all thought him the most beautiful prince\nthat had ever been seen.\n\nAt last they asked him who he was. "I am the husband of your youngest\nprincess," he answered.\n\n"No, no, indeed you are not," they said; "for he is a poor, common-looking,\nand ugly man."\n\n"But I am he," answered the prince; only no one would believe him.\n\n"Tell us the truth," said the servants; "who are you!"\n\n"Perhaps you cannot recognise me," said the young prince, "but call the\nyoungest princess here. I wish to speak to her." The servants called her, and\nshe came. "That man is not my husband," she said at once. "My husband is not\nnearly as handsome as that man. This must be a prince from another country."\n\nThen she said to him, "Who are you? Why do you say you are my husband?"\n\n"Because I am your husband. I am telling you the truth," answered the young\nprince.\n\n"No, you are not, you are not telling me the truth," said the little princess.\n"My husband is not a handsome man like you.: I married a very poor, common-\nlooking man."\n\n"That is true," he answered, "but nevertheless I am your husband. I was the\ngrain merchant\'s servant; and one hot night I went into your father\'s garden\nand sang, and you heard me, and came and asked me who I was and where I came\nfrom, and I would not answer you. And the same thing happened the next night,\nand the next, and on the fourth I told you I was a very poor man, and had come\nfrom my country to seek service in yours, and that I was the grain merchant\'s\nservant. Then you told your father you wished to marry, but must choose your\nown husband; and when all the Kings and Rajas were seated in your father\'s\ngarden, you sat on an elephant and went round and looked at them all; and then\ntwice hung your gold necklace round my neck, and chose me. See, here is your\nnecklace, and here are the ring and the handkerchief you. gave me on our\nwedding day."\n\nThen she believed him, and was very glad that her husband was such a beautiful\nyoung prince. "What a strange man you are!" she said to him. "Till now you\nhave been poor, and ugly, and common-looking. Now you are beautiful and look\nlike a prince; I never saw such a handsome man as you are before; and yet I\nknow you must be my husband." Then she worshipped God and thanked him for\nletting her have such a husband. "I have," she said, "a beautiful husband.\nThere is no one like him in this country. He has a moon on his forehead and a\nstar on his chin." Then she took him into the palace, and showed him to her\nfather and mother and to every one. They all said they had never seen any one\nlike him, and were all very happy. And the young prince lived as before in the\nKing\'s palace with his wife, and Katar lived in the King\'s stables.\n\nOne day, when the King and his seven sons-in-law were in his court-house, and\nit was full of people, the young prince said to him, "There are six thieves\nhere in your court-house." "Six thieves!" said the King. "Where are they? Show\nthem to me." "There they are," said the young prince, pointing to his six\nbrothers-in-law. The King and every one else in the court-house were very much\nastonished, and would not believe the young prince. "Take off their coats," he\nsaid, "and then you will see for yourselves that each of them has the mark of\na thief on his back." So their coats were taken off the six princes, and the\nKing and everybody in the court-house saw the mark of the red-hot pice. The\nsix princes were very much ashamed, but the young prince was very glad. He had\nnot forgotten how his brothers-in-law had laughed at him and mocked him when\nhe seemed a poor, common man.\n\nNow, when Katar was still in the jungle, before the prince was married, be had\ntold the boy the whole story of his birth, and all that had happened to him\nand his mother. "When you are married," he said to him, "I will take you back\nto your father\'s country." So two months after the young prince had revenged\nhimself on his brothers-in-law, Katar said to him, "It is time for you to\nreturn to your father. Get the King to let you go to your own country, and I\nwill tell you what to do when we get there."\n\nThe prince always did, what his horse told him to do; so he went to his wife\nand said to her, "I wish very much to go to my own country to see my father\nand mother." "Very well," said his wife; "I will tell my father and mother,\nand ask them to let us go." Then she went to them, and told them, and they\nconsented to let her and her husband leave them. The King gave his daughter\nand the young prince a great many horses, and elephants, and all sorts of\npresents, and also a great many sepoys to guard them. In this grand state they\ntravelled to the prince\'s country, which was not a great many miles off. When\nthey reached it they pitched their tents on the same plain in which the prince\nhad been left in his box by the nurse, where Shankar and Suri had swallowed\nhim so often.\n\nWhen the King, his father, the gardener\'s daughter\'s husband, saw the prince\'s\ncamp, he was very much alarmed, and thought a great King had come to make war\non him. He sent one of his servants, therefore, to ask whose camp it was. The\nyoung prince then wrote him a letter, in which he said, "You are a great King.\nDo not fear me. I am not come to make war on you. I am as if I were your son.\nI am a prince who has come to see your country and to speak with you. I wish\nto give you a grand feast, to which every one in your country must come--men\nand women, old and young, rich and poor, of all castes; all the children,\nfakirs, and sepoys. You must bring them all here to me for a week, and I will\nfeast them all."\n\nThe King was delighted with this letter, and ordered all the men, women, and\nchildren of all castes, fakirs, and sepoys, in his country to go to the\nprince\'s camp to a grand feast the prince would give them. So they all came,\nand the King brought his four wives too. All came, at least all but the\ngardener\'s daughter. No one had told her to go to the feast, for no one had\nthought of her.\n\nWhen all the people were assembled, the prince saw his mother was not there,\nand he asked the King, "Has every one in your country come to my feast?"\n\n"Yes, every one," said the King.\n\n"Are you sure of that?" asked the prince.\n\n"Quite sure," answered the King.\n\n"I am sure one woman has not come," said the prince. "She is your gardener\'s\ndaughter, who was once your wife and is now a servant in your palace."\n\n"True," said the King, "I had forgotten her." Then the prince told his\nservants to take his finest palanquin and to fetch the gardener\'s daughter.\nThey were to bathe her, dress her in beautiful clothes and handsome jewels,\nand then bring her to him in the palanquin.\n\nWhile the servants were bringing the gardener\'s daughter, the King thought how\nhandsome the young prince was; and he noticed particularly the moon on his\nforehead and\' the star on his chin, and he wondered in what country the young\nprince was born.\n\nAnd now the palanquin arrived bringing the gardener\'s daughter, and the young\nprince went himself and took her out of it, and brought her into the tent. He\nmade her a great many salaams. The four wicked wives looked on and were very\nmuch surprised and very angry. They remembered that, when they arrived, the\nprince had made them no salaams, and since then had not taken the least notice\nof them; whereas he could not do enough for the gardener\'s daughter, and\nseemed very glad to see her.\n\nWhen they were all at dinner, the prince again made the gardener\'s daughter a\ngreat many salaams, and gave her food from all the nicest dishes. She wondered\nat his kindness to her, and thought, "Who is this handsome prince, with a moon\non his forehead and a star on his chin? I never saw any one so beautiful..\nWhat country does be come from?"\n\nTwo or three days were thus passed in feasting; and all that time the King and\nhis people were talking about the prince\'s beauty, and wondering who he was.\n\nOne day the prince asked the King if he had any children., "None," he\nanswered.\n\n"Do you know who I am?" asked the prince.\n\n"No," said the King. "Tell me who you are."\n\n"I am your son," answered the prince, "and the gardener\'s daughter is my\nmother."\n\nThe King shook his head sadly. "How can you be my son," he said, "when I have\nnever had any children?"\n\n"But I am your son," answered the prince. "Your four wicked Queens told you\nthe gardener\'s daughter had given you a stone and not a son; but it was they\nwho put the stone in my little bed, and then they tried to kill me."\n\nThe King did not believe him. "I wish you were my son," he said; "but as I\nnever had a child, you cannot be my son." "Do you remember your dog Shankar,\nand how you had him killed? And do you remember your cow Suri, and how you had\nher killed too? Your wives made you kill them because of me. And," he said,\ntaking the King to Katar, "do you know whose horse that is?"\n\nThe King looked at Katar, and then said, "That is my horse Katar." "Yes," said\nthe prince. "Do you not remember how he rushed past you out of his stable with\nme on his back?" Then Katar told the King the prince was really his son, and\ntold him all the story of his birth, and of his life up to that moment; and\nwhen the King found the beautiful prince was indeed his son, he was so glad,\nso glad. He put his arms round him and kissed him and cried for joy.\n\n"Now," said the King, "you must come with me to my palace, and live with me\nalways."\n\n"No," said the prince, "that I cannot do. I cannot go to your palace. I only\ncame here to fetch my mother; and now that I have found her, I will take her\nwith me to my father-in-law\'s palace. I have married a King\'s daughter, and we\nlive with her father."\n\n"But now that I have found you, I cannot let you go," said his father. "You\nand your wife must come and live with your mother and me in my palace."\n\n"That we will never do," said the prince, "unless you will kill your four\nwicked Queens with your own hand. If you will do that, we will come and live\nwith you."\n\nSo the King killed his Queens, and\' then he and his wife, the gardener\'s\ndaughter, and the prince and his wife, all went to live in the King\'s palace,\nand lived there happily together for ever after; and the King thanked God for\ngiving him such a beautiful son, and for ridding him of his four wicked wives.\n\nKatar did not return to the fairies\' country, but stayed always with the young\nprince, and never left him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Prince and the Fakir](ift24.htm)\n\n'
