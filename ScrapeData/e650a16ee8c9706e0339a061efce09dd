Now (those who know the law) prescribe the carrying of a waterpot. 1\n\n2\\. It is declared (in the Vedas) that fire (resides) in the right ear of a\ngoat, in the right hand of a Brahma _n_ a, likewise in water (and) in a bundle\nof Ku _s_ a grass. Therefore after personal purification let him wipe (his\nwater-vessel) on all sides with his (right) hand, (reciting the mantra),\n\'Blaze up, O fire;\' for that (is called) encircling it with fire and is\npreferable to heating (the pot on the fire). 2\n\n3\\. With reference to this matter they prescribe also (the following rules):\n\'If he thinks in his heart that (the pot) has been slightly defiled, let him\nlight Ku _s_ a or (other) grass and heat (the pot) on all sides, keeping his\nright hand turned towards it.\' 3\n\n4\\. \'If (pots) have been touched by crows, dogs, or 4\n\np. 161\n\nother (unclean animals, they shall be heated, until they are of) the colour of\nfire, after the (paryagnikara _n_ a has been performed).\'\n\n5\\. (Pots) which have been defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen, and the\nlike must be thrown away. 5\n\n6\\. If his waterpot has been broken, let him offer one hundred (oblations)\nreciting the Vyah _ri_ tis, or mutter (the Vyah _ri_ tis as often). 6\n\n7\\. (Reciting the text), \'Earth went to earth, the mother joined the mother;\nmay we have sons and cattle; may he who hates us be destroyed,\' he shall\ncollect the fragments, throw them into water, repeat the Gayatri at least ten\ntimes and take again another (pot). 7\n\n8\\. Taking refuge with Varu _n_ a, (he shall recite the mantra), \'That\n(belongs) to thee, Varu _n_ a; again to me, Om,\' (and) meditate on the\nindestructible. 8\n\np. 162\n\n9\\. \'If he has received (the new vessel) from a _S_ udra, let him recite (the\nGayatri) one hundred (times). (If he has received it) from a Vai _s_ ya, fifty\n(repetitions of the Gayatri) are prescribed, but (on receiving it) from a\nKshatriya twenty-five, (and on taking it) from a Brahma _n_ a ten.\' 9\n\n10\\. Those who recite the Veda are doubtful whether he shall fetch water after\nthe sun has, set or shall not fetch it.\n\n11\\. The most excellent (opinion is) that he may fetch it.\n\n12\\. Let him restrain his breath, while he fetches water.\n\n13\\. Fire, forsooth, takes up water. 13\n\n14\\. It is declared (in the Veda), \'When he has washed his hands and feet with\nwater from his water-vessel, he is impure for others, as long as the moisture\n(remains). He purifies himself only. Let him not perform other religious rites\n(with water from his pot).\' 14\n\np. 163\n\n15\\. Baudhayana (says), \'Or if on the occasion of each personal purification\n(he washes himself with other water) up to the wrist, (he will become) pure.\'\n15\n\n16\\. Now they quote also (the following verses):\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[160:1](sbe1439.htm#fr_810) **6**. As Govinda observes, the rules regarding\nthe waterpot (kama _n_ _d_ alu) are introduced here in connexion with I, 3, 5,\n4.\n\n[160:2](sbe1439.htm#fr_811) Vasish _th_ a XII, 15-16. The mantra is found,\nTaittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 1, 4.\n\n[160:3](sbe1439.htm#fr_812) The word upadi _s_ anti, \'they prescribe,\' stands\nat the end of Sutra 4, as it refers to both rules.\n\n[160:4](sbe1439.htm#fr_813) Vasish _th_ a III, 59. The paryagnikara _n_ a is\nthe rite prescribed in Sutra 2.\n\n[161:5](sbe1439.htm#fr_814) Vasish _th_ a III, 59.\n\n[161:6](sbe1439.htm#fr_815) Regarding the Vyah _ri_ tis, see Gautama I, 51.\n\n[161:7](sbe1439.htm#fr_816) Govinda says that Vamadeva is the _Ri_ shi of the\nmantra. The fragments of the pot are to be thrown into a river or tank, in\norder to preserve them from defilement. See also Journ. Bo. Br. Roy. As. Soc.,\nNo. XXXIV A, p. 55 note.\n\n[161:8](sbe1439.htm#fr_817) \'Taking refuge with Varu _n_ a, i.e. saying, "I\nflee for safety to Varu _n_ a." (The words), "That for thee, Varu _n_ a, again\nto me, Om," (are) the mantras (to be recited) on taking (a new vessel). Its\nmeaning is this: "Those fragments which I have thrown into the water shall\nbelong to thee, Varu _n_ a," (Saying), "Come, thou (who art) a lord of water-\nvessels, again to me, Om," he shall meditate on another visible pot as\nindestructible, i.e. at the end of the Vedic (word) "Om," let him meditate,\n(i.e.) recollect, that not everything will be turned topsy-turvy, (but that\nsome things are) also indestructible, i.e. that that is not destroyed, does\nnot perish.\'--Govinda. The explanation of the last clause of our Sutra seems\nto be that, on pronouncing the syllable (akshara) Om, the reciter is p. 162 to\nrecollect the etymological import of the word akshara, \'indestructible,\' and\nthus to guard the new vessel against the mishap which befell the old one.\n\n[162:9](sbe1439.htm#fr_818) According to Govinda, either the pra _n_ ava, the\nsyllable Om, or the Gayatri are the mantras to be recited, and the recitation\nis a penance to be performed when the vessel is received. The MSS. of the text\nmark the verse as quotation by adding the word \'iti,\' which the commentary\nomits.\n\n[162:13](sbe1439.htm#fr_819) According to Govinda, a Brahma _n_ a who goes to\nfetch water at night, which he may want for personal purification, is ordered\nto restrain his breath, because thereby the air in the body becomes strong,\nand fire or heat (agni) is produced. Now as at night the sun is stated to\nenter the fire and to become subject to it, a Brahma _n_ a, who by restraining\nhis breath has produced fire, has secured the presence of the sun, when he\ngoes to fetch water.\n\n[162:14](sbe1439.htm#fr_820) Govinda expressly states that the word vie, vi\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ayate, \'it is declared,\'p. 163 literally, \'it is distinctly known,\'\nalways indicates that the passage quoted is taken from the Veda. The rites for\nwhich water from the waterpot is not to be used, are libations to the manes,\nthe gods, and the fire. See also below, I, 4, 7, 5.\n\n[163:15](sbe1439.htm#fr_821) The words enclosed between parentheses are\nGovinda\'s.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 4, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 7](sbe1440.htm)\n\n'
