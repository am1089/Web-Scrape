If it be said that some (mention) that which is based on inference (i.e.\nthe pradhana); we deny this, because (the term alluded to) refers to what is\ncontained in the simile of the body (i.e. the body itself); and (that the\ntext) shows.\n\nIn the preceding part of this work--as whose topic there has been set forth an\nenquiry into Brahman--we have at first defined Brahman (I, 1, 2); we have\nthereupon refuted the objection that that definition applies to the pradhana\nalso, by showing that there is no scriptural authority for the latter (I, 1,\n5), and we have shown in detail that the common purport of all Vedanta-texts\nis to set forth the doctrine that Brahman, and not the pradha _n_ a, is the\ncause of the world. Here, however, the Sa _n_ khya again raises an objection\nwhich he considers not to have been finally disposed of.\n\nIt has not, he says, been satisfactorily proved that there is no scriptural\nauthority for the pradhana; for some _s_ akhas contain expressions which seem\nto convey the idea of the pradhana. From this it follows that Kapila and other\nsupreme _ri_ shis maintain the doctrine of the pradhana being the general\ncause only because it is based on the Veda.--As long therefore as it has not\nbeen proved that those passages to which the San _k_ hyas refer have a\ndifferent meaning (i.e. do not allude to the pradhana), all our previous\nargumentation as to the omniscient Brahman being the cause of the world must\nbe considered as unsettled. We therefore now begin a new chapter which aims at\nproving that those passages actually have a different meaning.\n\nThe Sa _n_ khyas maintain that that also which is based on inference, i.e. the\npradhana, is perceived in the text of some _s_ akhas. We read, for instance,\nthey say, in the Ka _th_ aka (I, 3, 11), 'Beyond the Great there is the\nUndeveloped,\n\np. 238\n\nbeyond the Undeveloped there is the Person.' There we recognise, named by the\nsame names and enumerated in the same order, the three entities with which we\nare acquainted from the Sa _n_ khya-sm _ri_ ti, viz. the great principle, the\nUndeveloped (the pradhana), and the soul 1. That by the Undeveloped is meant\nthe pradhana is to be concluded from the common use of Sm _ri_ ti and from the\netymological interpretation of which the word admits, the pradhana being\ncalled undeveloped because it is devoid of sound and other qualities. It\ncannot therefore be asserted that there is no scriptural authority for the\npradhana. And this pradhana vouched for by Scripture we declare to be the\ncause of the world, on the ground of Scripture, Sm _ri_ ti, and ratiocination.\n\nYour reasoning, we reply, is not valid. The passage from the Ka _th_ aka\nquoted by you intimates by no means the existence of that great principle and\nthat Undeveloped which are known from the Sa _n_ khya-sm _ri_ ti. We do not\nrecognise there the pradhana of the Sa _n_ khyas, i.e. an independent general\ncause consisting of three constituting elements; we merely recognise the word\n'Undeveloped,' which does not denote any particular determined thing, but may\n--owing to its etymological meaning, 'that which is not developed, not\nmanifest'--denote anything subtle and difficult to distinguish. The Sa _n_\nkhyas indeed give to the word a settled meaning, as they apply it to the\npradhana; but then that meaning is valid for their system only, and has no\nforce in the determination of the sense of the Veda. Nor does mere equality of\nposition prove equality of being, unless the latter be recognised\nindependently. None but a fool would think a cow to be a horse because he sees\nit tied in the usual place of a horse. We, moreover, conclude, on the strength\nof the general subject-matter, that the passage does not refer to the pradhana\nthe fiction of the Sa _n_ khyas, 'on account of there being referred\n\np. 239\n\nto that which is contained in the simile of the body.' This means that the\nbody which is mentioned in the simile of the chariot is here referred to as\nthe Undeveloped. We infer this from the general subject-matter of the passage\nand from the circumstance of nothing else remaining.--The immediately\npreceding part of the chapter exhibits the simile in which the Self, the body,\nand so on, are compared to the lord of a chariot, a chariot, &c., 'Know the\nSelf to be the lord of the chariot, the body to be the chariot, the intellect\nthe charioteer, and the mind the reins. The senses they call the horses, the\nobjects of the senses their roads. When he (the Self) is in union with the\nbody, the senses and the mind, then wise people call him the enjoyer.' The\ntext then goes on to say that he whose senses, &c. are not well controlled\nenters into sa _m_ sara, while he who has them under control reaches the end\nof the journey, the highest place of Vish _n_ u. The question then arises:\nWhat is the end of the journey, the highest place of Vish _n_ u? Whereupon the\ntext explains that the highest Self which is higher than the senses, &c.,\nspoken of is the end of the journey, the highest place of Vish _n_ u. 'Beyond\nthe senses there are the objects, beyond the objects there is the mind, beyond\nthe mind there is the intellect, the great Self is beyond the intellect.\nBeyond the great there is the Undeveloped, beyond the Undeveloped there is the\nPerson. Beyond the Person there is nothing--this is the goal, the highest\nRoad.' In this passage we recognise the senses, &c. which in the preceding\nsimile had been compared to horses and so on, and we thus avoid the mistake of\nabandoning the matter in hand and taking up a new subject. The senses, the\nintellect, and the mind are referred to in both passages under the same names.\nThe objects (in the second passage) are the objects which are (in the former\npassage) designated as the roads of the senses; that the objects are beyond\n(higher than) the senses is known from the scriptural passage representing the\nsenses as grahas, i.e. graspers, and the objects as atigrahas, i. e. superior\nto the grahas (B _ri_ Up. III, 2). The mind (manas) again is superior to the\nobjects, because the relation of the senses and their objects is based on the\nmind. The intellect\n\np. 240\n\n(buddhi) is higher than the mind, since the objects of enjoyment are conveyed\nto the soul by means of the intellect. Higher than the intellect is the great\nSelf which was represented as the lord of the chariot in the passage, 'Know\nthe Self to be the lord of the chariot.' That the same Self is referred to in\nboth passages is manifest from the repeated use of the word 'Self;' that the\nSelf is superior to intelligence is owing to the circumstance that the enjoyer\nis naturally superior to the instrument of enjoyment. The Self is\nappropriately called great as it is the master.--Or else the phrase 'the great\nSelf' may here denote the intellect of the first-born Hira _n_ yagarbha which\nis the basis of all intellects; in accordance with the following Sm _ri_ ti-\npassage' it is called mind, the great one; reflection, Brahman; the\nstronghold, intellect; enunciation, the Lord; highest knowledge,\nconsciousness; thought, remembrance  1,' and likewise with the following\nscriptural passage, 'He (Hira _n_ yagarbha) who first creates Brahman and\ndelivers the Vedas to him' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 18). The intellect, which in the\nformer passage had been referred to under its common name buddhi, is here\nmentioned separately, since it may be represented as superior to our human\nintellects. On this latter explanation of the term 'the great Self,' we must\nassume that the personal Self which in the simile had been compared to the\ncharioteer is, in the latter passage, included in the highest person\n(mentioned last); to which there is no objection, since in reality the\npersonal Self and the highest Self are identical.--Thus there remains now the\nbody only which had before been compared to a chariot. We therefore conclude\n\np. 241\n\nthat the text after having enumerated the senses and all the other things\nmentioned before, in order to point out the highest place, points out by means\nof the one remaining word, viz. avyakta, the only thing remaining out of those\nwhich had been mentioned before, viz. the body. The entire passage aims at\nconveying the knowledge of the unity of the inward Self and Brahman, by\ndescribing the soul's passing through sa _m_ sara and release under the form\nof a simile in which the body, &c. of the soul--which is affected by Nescience\nand therefore joined to a body, senses, mind, intellect, objects, sensations,\n&c.--are compared to a chariot, and so on.--In accordance with this the\nsubsequent verse states the difficulty of knowing the highest place of Vish\n_n_ u ('the Self is hidden in all beings and does not shine forth, but it is\nseen by subtle seers through their sharp and subtle intellect'), and after\nthat the next verse declares Yoga to be the means of attaining that cognition.\n'A wise man should keep down speech in the mind, he should keep down the mind\nin intelligence, intelligence he should keep down within the great Self, and\nhe should keep that within the quiet Self.'--That means: The wise man should\nrestrain the activity of the outer organs such as speech, &c., and abide\nwithin the mind only; he should further restrain the mind which is intent on\ndoubtful external objects within intelligence, whose characteristic mark is\ndecision, recognising that indecision is evil; he should further restrain\nintelligence within the great Self, i.e. the individual soul or else the\nfundamental intellect; he should finally fix the great Self on the calm Self,\ni.e. the highest Self, the highest goal, of which the whole chapter treats.--\nIf we in this manner review the general context, we perceive that there is no\nroom for the pradhana imagined by the Sankhyas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[238:1](sbe34112.htm#fr_232) The Great one is the technical Sa _n_ khya-term\nfor buddhi, avyakta is a common designation of pradhana or prak _ri_ ti, and\npurusha is the technical name of the soul.
