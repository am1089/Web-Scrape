And, in the morning, having taken out the ashes, and smeared (the\nfire-places) with cow-dung, he lifts the two fires on the churning-sticks, and\nreturns (to the offering-ground). Having then churned out the Garhapatya,\ntaken out the \xc3\x82havaniya, and brought the Anvaharya-pa _k_ ana (to the southern\nhearth), he should prepare a cake on eight potsherds to Agni Pathik _ri_ t\n(the path-maker). The course of procedure thereof (is as follows):--he should\nrecite those same seventeen kindling-verses; the two butter-portions relate to\nthe slaying of V _ri_ tra 3; the sa _m_ ya _g_ yas are two Vira _g_ verses 3;\nand the invitatory and offering formulas are as follows:--(the anuvakya, _Ri_\ng-veda VI, 16, 3), 'For thou, most wise Agni, divine disposer, readily knowest\nthe ways and paths at sacrifices;' and the ya _g_ ya ( _Ri_ g-veda X, 2, 3),\n'We have entered upon the path of the gods to carry on what we can do: the\nwise Agni shall sacrifice,\n\np. 192\n\nhe shall be the priest, he shall order the sacrifices and their seasons;' for\nAgni is the path-maker, the guide of paths: he, verily, guides him upon the\npath of sacrifice. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.\n\n12:4:4:22\\. They also say, 'If any one's fires were to come in contact with\neach other, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' If this\nburning (fire) were to come (to the other) from behind, he may know that light\nhas come to him from beyond; that the gods have helped him, and that he will\nbecome more glorious. But if his heart should at all misgive him, let him\nprepare a cake on eight potsherds for Agni Vivi _k_ i (the discerning). The\ncourse of procedure thereof (is as follows):--he should recite those same\nseventeen kindling-verses; the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of V\n_ri_ tra; the sa _m_ ya _g_ yas are two Vira _g_ verses; and the invitatory\nand offering formulas are as follows:--(the anuvakya, _Ri_ g-veda VI, 6, 3),\n'Thy brilliant, wind-sped flames, bright Agni, spread in every direction: the\ndivine ninefold destroyers overpower the woods, boldly crushing them;' and the\nya _g_ ya ( _Ri_ g-veda V, 8, 3), 'The tribes of men glorify thee, Agni, the\ndiscerning knower of offerings, and most liberal dispenser of treasures; thee,\nO wealthy one, dwelling in secret, yet visible to all, loud-sounding offerer\nof sacrifice, glorying in ghee!' And if any one should desire to rid himself\nof his spiteful enemy, let him, with that object in view, perform this\noffering, and he verily will rid himself of him. This; then, is the rite\nperformed in that case.\n\np. 193\n\n12:4:4:33\\. If, however, this burning (fire) were to come from this side, he\nmay know that he will overcome his spiteful enemy; that he will become more\nglorious. But if his heart should at all misgive him, let him prepare a cake\non eight potsherds for Agni Sa _m_ varga (the despoiler). The course of\nprocedure thereof (is as follows):--he should recite those same seventeen\nkindling-verses; the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of V _ri_ tra,\nthe sa _m_ ya _g_ yas are two Vira _g_ verses; and the invitatory and offering\nformulas are as follows:--( _Ri_ g-veda VIII, 75, 15; Va _g_. S. XI, 71),\n'From the far region cross thou over to the near: protect thou that wherein I\nam!' and the ya _g_ ya ( _Ri_ g-veda VIII, 75, 12), 'Desert us not in this\ngreat strife, like as the bearer of a load: win thou the spoil (sa _m_ varga\n_m_ _g_ aya), win riches thou!' And if any one desire to despoil his spiteful\nenemy, let him, with that object in view, perform this offering, and he verily\nwill despoil him. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.\n\n12:4:4:44\\. They also say, 'If the lightning were to burn any one's\n(sacrificial fire), what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?'\nLet him know that light has come to him from above; that the gods have helped\nhim, and that he will become more glorious. But if his heart should at all\nmisgive him, let him prepare a cake on eight pot sherds for Agni Apsumat\n(abiding in the waters). The course of procedure thereof (is as follows):he\nshould recite those same seventeen kindling-verses; the two butter-portions\nrelate to the slaying of V _ri_ tra; the sa _m_ ya _g_ yas are two Vira _g_\nverses; and the invitatory and offering formulas are as follows:\n\np. 194\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--( _Ri_ g-veda VIII, 43, 9; Va _g_. S. XII, 36), 'In\nthe waters, O Agni, is thy seat; as such thou clingest to plants: being in\n(their) womb, thou art born again;' and the ya _g_ ya (Va _g_. S. XII, 37),\n'Thou art the child of the herbs, the child of the trees, the. child of all\nthat is, O Agni, thou art the child of the waters;'--he thereby bespeaks peace\non the part of those two (fires) for the safety of the Sacrificer's family and\ncattle. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.\n\n12:4:4:55\\. They also say, 'If any one's fires were to come in contact with\nimpure (profane) fires, what rite and what expiation would there be in that\ncase?' Let him prepare a cake on eight potsherds for Agni _S_ u _k_ i (the\nbright),--the course of procedure thereof (is as follows):--he should recite\nthose same seventeen kindling-verses; the two butter-portions relate to the\nslaying of V _ri_ tra; the sa _m_ ya _g_ yas are two Vira _g_ verses; and the\ninvitatory and offering formulas are as follows:--( _Ri_ g-veda VIII, 44, 21),\n'Agni of brightest work, the bright priest, the bright sage, brightly he\nshineth with offering fed;' and the ya _g_ ya ( _Ri_ g-veda VIII, 44, 17), 'Up\nrise thy flames, the bright, the pure, the shining, thy lights, O Agni;'--he\nthereby bespeaks peace to those two (kinds of fires) for the safety of the\nSacrificer's family and cattle. This, then, is the rite performed in that\ncase.\n\n12:4:4:66\\. They also say, 'If the sun were to set on any one's \xc3\x82havaniya not\nyet having been taken out, what rite and what expiation would there be in that\ncase?' Verily, those rays (of the sun) are the All-gods: they go from him, and\nthat (Agnihotra) fails\n\np. 195\n\nhim, because the gods go from him; and after that failure--whether he know it\nor know it not--those two (fires) say, 'He (the sun) has set on his unlifted\n(fire).' In such a case let him proceed thus:--having fastened a piece of\nyellow gold to a plant of darbha grass, let him order it to be taken towards\nthe back (west): thus it is made of the form of him who shines yonder; and\nthat (sun) being the day, it is made of the form of the day. And darbha plants\nare a means of purification 1: he thus purifies it thereby. Having then\nkindled some firewood, let him order it to be taken forward (to the \xc3\x82havaniya\nhearth). A Brahma _n_ a descended from a _Ri_ shi should take it out, for a\nBrahma _n_ a descended from a _Ri_ shi represents all the deities: it is thus\nwith the help of all the deities that he causes it (the fire) to succeed.\nHaving laid it down, he returns, and having placed ghee on the Garhapatya,\ntaken it off, purified it and looked down on it 2, he takes ghee by four\nladlings, and, having seized a log, he hastens up to the front; and, having\nput the log on the \xc3\x82havaniya, he bends his right knee, and offers with, 'To\nthe All-gods, hail!' Even as one would call (back) to him a Brahma _n_ a\nstaying at one's dwelling, when he goes away offended, by (presenting him\nwith) a cow longing for the bull, so he thereby calls to him the All-gods; and\nthey indeed acknowledge, and\n\np. 196\n\nturn to, him. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.\n\n12:4:4:77\\. They also say, 'If the sun were to rise over any one's \xc3\x82havaniya\nnot having been taken out, what rite and what expiation would there be in that\ncase?' Verily, those rays are the All-gods; and, having dwelt there, they now\ngo from him, and that (Agnihotra) fails him, because the gods go from him; and\nafter that failure--whether he know it or know it not--those two (fires) say,\n'He (the sun) has risen on his unlifted (fire)' In such a case let him proceed\nthus:--having fastened a piece of white gold (silver) to a plant of darbha\ngrass, let him order it to be taken towards the front: thus it is made of the\nform of the moon; and, the moon being the night, it is made of the form of the\nnight. And darbha plants are a means of purification: he thus purifies it\nthereby. Having then kindled some firewood, let him order it to be taken after\n(the piece of silver). A Brahma _n_ a descended from a _Ri_ shi should take it\nout, for a Brahma _n_ a descended from a _Ri_ shi represents all the deities:\nit is thus with the help of all the deities that he causes it (the fire) to\nsucceed. Having laid it down, he returns, and, having placed ghee on the\nGarhapatya, taken it off, purified it and looked down upon it, he takes ghee\nin the same way as it was taken before, and, having seized a log, he hastens\nup to the front; and, having put the log on the \xc3\x82havaniya, he bends his right\nknee and offers with, 'To the All-gods, hail!' The import is the same as\nbefore; and, verily, no hurt and no harm of any kind befalls where that\nexpiation is made. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[191:3](sbe44061.htm#fr_532) See notes on [XIII, 4, 1,\n13](sbe44102.htm#13:4:1:13).\n\n[195:1](sbe44061.htm#fr_533) Viz. inasmuch as they are used as strainers; see\nI, 1, 3, 5; cf. also part i, p. 84, note 2.\n\n[195:2](sbe44061.htm#fr_534) Whilst, on ordinary occasions, in clarifying\nbutter for offering, the priest would first make the lady of the house look\ndown on the ghee taken from the fire, before he himself (or the Sacrificer)\ndoes so (I, 3, 1, 19; 26); on the present occasion--as at offerings to the\nFathers (Katy.
