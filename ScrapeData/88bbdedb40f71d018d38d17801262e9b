'When the seer sees the\nbrilliant maker and Lord as the Person who has his source in Brahman, then\npossessing true knowledge he shakes off good and evil, and, free from passion,\nreaches the highest oneness' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 3). 'As the flowing rivers\ndisappear in the sea, losing their name and form, thus a wise man freed from\nname and form goes to the divine Person who is higher than the high' (III, 2,\n8). For it is only those freed from the bondage of Sa _m_ sara who shake off\ngood and evil, are free from passion, and freed from name and form.\n\nFor the Sa _m_ sara state consists in the possession of name and form, which\nis due to connexion with non-sentient matter, such connexion springing from\ngood and evil works. The Person therefore who is the abode of heaven, earth,\n&c., and whom the text declares to be the aim to be reached by those who,\nhaving freed themselves from good and evil, and hence from all contact with\nmatter, attain supreme oneness with the highest Brahman, can be none other\nthan this highest Brahman itself.\n\nThis conclusion, based on terms exclusively applicable to the highest Brahman,\nis now confirmed by reference to the absence of terms specially applicable to\nthe individual soul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 3.
