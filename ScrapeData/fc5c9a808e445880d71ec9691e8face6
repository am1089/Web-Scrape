Now, when the Adhvaryu here steps up and says, 'The Gharma is\naglow,' they step up and revere it (the Mahavira) with the Avaka _s_ a 1; but\nthe 'avaka _s_ a' are the vital airs: it is thus the vital airs he lays into\nit. Six of them 2 step up to it, for six in number are these vital airs in the\nhead: it is these he thus lays into it.\n\n14:1:4:22\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 14,] 'The child of the gods,'--the child\n(garbha) of the gods, in truth, is he that shines yonder, for he holds (grabh)\neverything here, and by him everything here is held; and the Pravargya also is\nthat (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'The child of\nthe gods.'\n\n14:1:4:33\\. 'The father of thoughts,'--for he (the sun) is indeed the father\nof thoughts;--'the lord of creatures,'--for he is indeed the lord of\ncreatures.\n\n14:1:4:44\\. 'The god hath united with the god Savit _ri_ ,'--for the god (the\nMahavira) has indeed united with the god Savit _ri_ (the sun);--'with Surya he\nshineth,'--for (equally) with Surya (the sun) he has indeed shone.\n\n14:1:4:55\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 15,] 'Agni hath united with Agni,'--for Agni\n(fire) has indeed united with Agni;--'with the divine Savit _ri_ ,'--for with\nthe divine Savit _ri_ he has indeed united;--'with Surya\n\np. 470\n\nhe hath shone,'--for with Surya he has indeed shone.\n\n14:1:4:66\\. 'Hail! Agni hath united with his heat,'--for Agni has indeed\nunited with his heat; the call of hail he places first, and the deity last:\nthe significance of this is the same as before;--'with the divine Savit _ri_\n,'--for with the divine Savit _ri_ he has indeed united;--'with Surya he hath\nshed light,'--for with Surya he has indeed shed light.\n\n14:1:4:77\\. These, then, are three 'avaka _s_ a,'--for there are three vital\nairs, the in (and out)-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing:\nit is thereby that he lays it (the vital air) into him.\n\n14:1:4:88\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 16,] 'The sustainer of the sky, and of heat\nupon earth, shineth forth,'--for as the sustainer of the sky, and of heat on\nearth, that (sun, and Mahavira) indeed shines forth;--'the divine sustainer of\nthe gods, he, the immortal, born of heat,'--for he is indeed the divine\nsustainer of the gods, the immortal one, born of heat;--'grant unto us speech,\ndevoted to the gods!'--speech doubtless is worship: he thus means to say\nthereby, 'bestow upon us worship whereby we shall please the gods!'\n\n14:1:4:99\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 17; _Ri_ g-v. I, 164, 31; X, 177, 3,] 'I\nbeheld the guardian, the never-resting 1,'--he who shines yonder is indeed the\nguardian, for he guards everything here; and he does not lie down to rest:\ntherefore he says, 'I beheld the guardian, the never-resting;'--\n\np. 471\n\n14:1:4:1010, 'Wandering on paths hither and thither,'--for he indeed wanders\nhither and thither on the divine 1 paths;--'arraying himself in the gathering\nand the radiating,'--for he indeed arrays himself in the gathering\n(converging) and the radiating regions, or rays;--'he moveth to and fro within\nthe spheres,'--for again and again he wanders moving within these worlds.\n\n14:1:4:1111\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 18,] 'O lord of all worlds, O lord of all\nthought, O lord of all speech, O lord of every speech!' that is, 'O lord of\nall this (universe);'--'Thou art heard by the gods, O god Gharma, as a god,\nguard thou the gods!' in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak.\n\n14:1:4:1212\\. 'Give thy countenance hereafter to the divine feast of you two,'\n--it is with regard to the two A _s_ vins that he says this, for it was the A\n_s_ vins that then restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus\npleases, and therefore he says, 'Give thy countenance hereafter to the divine\nfeast of you two.'\n\n14:1:4:1313\\. 'Honey to the two lovers of honey! honey to the two longing for\nhoney!'--for Dadhya _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a indeed told them (the A _s_\nvins) the Brahma _n_ a called Madhu (honey), and this is their dear resource:\nit is by means of that (dear resource) of theirs that he approaches them, and\ntherefore he says, 'Honey to the two lovers of honey! honey to the two longing\nfor honey!'\n\n14:1:4:1414\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 19,] 'To the heart\n\np. 472\n\n[paragraph continues] (I consecrate) thee, to the mind thee, to the sky thee,\nto the sun thee: going upwards take thou the sacrifice to the gods in heaven!'\nin this there is nothing hidden, so to speak.\n\n14:1:4:1515\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 20,] 'Thou art our father: be thou our\nfather!'--for he who shines yonder is indeed the father, and the Pravargya is\nthat (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'Thou art our\nfather: be thou our father!'--'Reverence be unto thee: injure me not!'--it is\na blessing he thereby invokes.\n\n14:1:4:1616\\. Thereupon he uncovers the head of the (Sacrificer's) wife, and\nmakes her say whilst she is looking at the Mahavira, 'Together with Tvash _t_\n_ri_ will we serve thee: (bestow thou sons and cattle upon me! bestow thou\noffspring upon us! may I remain unscathed together with my husband!)'--the\nPravargya (m.) is a male, and the wife is a female: a productive pair is thus\nproduced.\n\n14:1:4:1717\\. And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this\n(Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the\nsame as at the creation 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[469:1](sbe44120.htm#fr_1251) Avaka _s_ a (looks, or possibly, apertures) is\nthe technical designation of the verses Va _g_.
