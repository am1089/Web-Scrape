Then, with years,  \nThe truth grew dim and perished, noble Prince!  \nNow once again to thee it is declared-  \nThis ancient lore, this mystery supreme-  \nSeeing I find thee votary and friend.  \nArjuna. Thy birth, dear Lord, was in these later days  \nAnd bright Vivaswata\'s preceded time!  \nHow shall I comprehend this thing thou sayest,  \n"From the beginning it was I who taught?"  \nKrishna. Manifold the renewals of my birth  \nHave been, Arjuna! and of thy births, too!  \nBut mine I know, and thine thou knowest not,  \nO Slayer of thy Foes! Albeit I be  \nUnborn, undying, indestructible,  \nThe Lord of all things living; not the less-  \nBy Maya, by my magic which I stamp  \nOn floating Nature-forms, the primal vast-  \nI come, and go, and come. When Righteousness  \nDeclines, O Bharata! when Wickedness  \nIs strong, I rise, from age to age, and take  \nVisible shape, and move a man with men,  \nSuccouring the good, thrusting the evil back,  \nAnd setting Virtue on her seat again.  \nWho knows the truth touching my births on earth  \nAnd my divine work, when he quits the flesh  \nPuts on its load no more, falls no more down  \nTo earthly birth: to Me he comes, dear Prince!\n\nMany there be who come! from fear set free,  \nFrom anger, from desire; keeping their hearts  \nFixed upon me- my Faithful- purified  \nBy sacred flame of Knowledge. Such as these  \nMix with my being. Whoso worship me,  \nThem I exalt; but all men everywhere  \nShall fall into my path; albeit, those souls  \nWhich seek reward for works, make sacrifice  \nNow, to the lower gods. I say to thee  \nHere have they their reward. But I am He  \nMade the Four Castes, and portioned them a place  \nAfter their qualities and gifts. Yea, I  \nCreated, the Reposeful; I that live  \nImmortally, made all those mortal births:  \nFor works soil not my essence, being works  \nWrought uninvolved. Who knows me acting thus  \nUnchained by action, action binds not him;  \nAnd, so perceiving, all those saints of old  \nWorked, seeking for deliverance. Work thou  \nAs, in the days gone by, thy fathers did.  \nThou sayst, perplexed, It hath been asked before  \nBy singers and by sages, "What is act,  \nAnd what inaction?" I will teach thee this,  \nAnd, knowing, thou shalt learn which work doth save  \nNeeds must one rightly meditate those three-  \nDoing,- not doing,- and undoing. Here  \nThorny and dark the path is! He who sees  \nHow action may be rest, rest action- he  \nIs wisest \'mid his kind; he hath the truth!  \nHe doeth well, acting or resting. Freed  \nIn all his works from prickings of desire,  \nBurned clean in act by the white fire of truth,  \nThe wise call that man wise; and such an one,  \nRenouncing fruit of deeds, always content.  \nAlways self-satisfying, if he works,  \nDoth nothing that shall stain his separate soul,  \nWhich- quit of fear and hope- subduing self-  \nRejecting outward impulse-yielding up  \nTo body\'s need nothing save body, dwells  \nSinless amid all sin, with equal calm  \nTaking what may befall, by grief unmoved,  \nUnmoved by joy, unenvyingly; the same  \nIn good and evil fortunes; nowise bound  \nBy bond of deeds. Nay, but of such an one,  \nWhose crave is gone, whose soul is liberate,  \nWhose heart is set on truth- of such an one  \nWhat work he does is work of sacrifice,  \nWhich passeth purely into ash and smoke  \nConsumed upon the altar! All\'s then God!  \nThe sacrifice is Brahm, the ghee and grain  \nAre Brahm, the fire is Brahm, the flesh it eats  \nIs Brahm, and unto Brahm attaineth he  \nWho, in such office, meditates on Brahm.  \nSome votaries there be who serve the gods  \nWith flesh and altar-smoke; but other some  \nWho, lighting subtler fires, make purer rite  \nWith will of worship. Of the which be they  \nWho, in white flame of continence, consume  \nJoys of the sense, delights of eye and ear,  \nForegoing tender speech and sound of song:  \nAnd they who, kindling fires with torch of Truth,  \nBurn on a hidden altar-stone the bliss  \nOf youth and love, renouncing happiness:  \nAnd they who lay for offering there their wealth,  \nTheir penance, meditation, piety,  \nTheir steadfast reading of the scrolls, their lore  \nPainfully gained with long austerities:  \nAnd they who, making silent sacrifice,  \nDraw in their breath to feed the flame of thought,  \nAnd breathe it forth to waft the heart on high,  \nGoverning the ventage of each entering air  \nLest one sigh pass which helpeth not the soul:  \nAnd they who, day by day denying needs,  \nLay life itself upon the altar-flame,  \nBurning the body wan. Lo! all these keep  \nThe rite of offering, as if they slew  \nVictims; and all thereby efface much sin.  \nYea! and who feed on the immortal food  \nLeft of such sacrifice, to Brahma pass,  \nTo The Unending. But for him that makes  \nNo sacrifice, he hath nor part nor lot  \nEven in the present world. How should he share  \nAnother, O thou Glory of thy Line?\n\nIn sight of Brahma all these offerings  \nAre spread and are accepted! Comprehend  \nThat all proceed by act; for knowing this,  \nThou shalt be quit of doubt. The sacrifice  \nWhich Knowledge pays is better than great gifts  \nOffered by wealth, since gifts\' worth- O my Prince!  \nLies in the mind which gives, the will that serves:  \nAnd these are gained by reverence, by strong search,  \nBy humble heed of those who see the Truth  \nAnd teach it. Knowing Truth, thy heart no more  \nWill ache with error, for the Truth shall show  \nAll things subdued to thee, as thou to Me.  \nMoreover, Son of Pandu! wert thou worst  \nOf all wrong-doers, this fair ship of Truth  \nShould bear thee safe and dry across the sea  \nOf thy transgressions. As the kindled flame  \nFeeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash,  \nSo unto ash, Arjuna! unto nought  \nThe flame of Knowledge wastes works\' dross away!  \nThere is no purifier like thereto  \nIn all this world, and he who seeketh it  \nShall find it- being grown perfect- in himself.  \nBelieving, he receives it when the soul  \nMasters itself, and cleaves to Truth, and comes-  \nPossessing knowledge- to the higher peace,  \nThe uttermost repose. But those untaught,  \nAnd those without full faith, and those who fear  \nAre shent; no peace is here or other where,  \nNo hope, nor happiness for whoso doubts.  \nHe that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt,  \nDisparting self from service, soul from works,  \nEnlightened and emancipate, my Prince!  \nWorks fetter him no more! Cut then atwain  \nWith sword of wisdom, Son of Bharata!  \nThis doubt that binds thy heart-beats! cleave the bond  \nBorn of thy ignorance! Be bold and wise!  \nGive thyself to the field with me! Arise!\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER IV OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Jnana Yog,"  \nOr "The Book of the Religion of Knowledge."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 5: Of Religion by Renouncing Fruit of Works](bg05.htm)\n\n'
