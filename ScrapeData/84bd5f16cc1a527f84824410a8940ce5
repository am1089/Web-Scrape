And the goblin said once more: "O King, I like you\nwonderfully well because you are not discouraged. So I will tell you a\ndelightful little story to relieve your weariness. Listen."\n\n\n\nIn the Anga country was a young king named Glory-banner, so beautiful that he\nseemed an incarnation of the god of love. He had conquered all his enemies by\nhis strength of arm, and he had a counsellor named Farsight.\n\nAt last the king, proud of his youth and beauty, entrusted all the power in\nhis quiet kingdom to his counsellor, and  gradually devoted himself entirely\nto pleasure. He spent all his time with the ladies of the court, and listened\nmore attentively to their love-songs than to the advice of statesmen. He took\ngreater pleasure in peeping into their windows than into the holes in his\nadministration. But Farsight bore the whole burden of public business, and\nnever wearied day or night.\n\nThen the people began to murmur: "The counsellor Farsight has seduced the\nking, and now he alone has all the kingly glory." And the counsellor said to\nhis wife, whose name was Prudence: "My dear, the king is devoted to his\npleasures, and great infamy is heaped upon me by the people. They say I have\ndevoured the kingdom, though in fact I support the burden of it. Now popular\ngossip damages the greatest man. Was not Rama forced to abandon his good wife\nby popular clamour? So what shall I do now?"\n\nThen his clever wife Prudence showed that she deserved her name. She said: "My\ndear, leave the king and go on a pilgrimage. Tell him that you are an old man\nnow, and should be permitted to travel in foreign countries for a time. Then\nthe gossip will cease, when they see that you are unselfish. And when you are\ngone, the king will bear his own burdens. And thus his levity will gradually\ndisappear. And when you come back, you can assume your office without\nreproach."\n\nTo this advice the counsellor assented, and said to the king in the course of\nconversation: "Your Majesty, permit me to go on a pilgrimage for a few days.\nVirtue seems of supreme importance to me."\n\nBut the king said: "No, no, counsellor. Is there no other kind of virtue\nexcept in pilgrimages? How about generosity and that kind of thing? Isn\'t it\npossible to prepare for heaven in your own house?"\n\nThen the counsellor said: "Your Majesty, one gets worldly prosperity from\ngenerosity and that kind of thing. But a pilgrimage gives eternal life. A\nprudent man should attend to it while he has strength. The chance may be lost,\nfor no one can be sure of his health."\n\nBut the king was still arguing against it when the doorkeeper came in and\nsaid: "Your Majesty, the glorious sun is diving beneath the pool of heaven.\nArise. The hour for your bath is slipping away." And the king went immediately\nto bathe.\n\nThe counsellor went home, still determined on his pilgrimage. He would not let\nhis wife go with him, but started secretly. Not even his servants knew.\n\nHe wandered alone through many countries to many holy places, and finally came\nto the Odra country. There he saw a city near the ocean, where he entered a\ntemple to Shiva and sat down in the court. There he sat, hot and dusty from\nlong travel, when he was seen by a merchant named Treasure who had come to\nworship the god. The merchant gathered from his dress and appearance that he\nwas a high-born Brahman, and invited him home, and entertained him with food,\nbathing, and the like.\n\nWhen the counsellor was rested, the merchant asked him: "Who are you? Whence\ndo you come? And where are you going?" And the other replied: "I am a Brahman\nnamed Farsight. I came here on a pilgrimage from the Anga country."\n\nThen the merchant Treasure said to him: "I am preparing for a trading voyage\nto Golden Island. Do you stay in my house. And when I come back, and you are\nwearied from your pilgrimage, rest here for a time before going home." But\nFarsight said: "I do not want to stay here. I would rather go with you." And\nthe good merchant agreed. And the counsellor slept in the first bed he had\nlain in for many nights.\n\nThe next day he went to the seashore with the merchant, and entered the ship\nloaded with the merchant\'s goods. He sailed along, admiring the wonders and\nterrors of the sea, till at last he reached Golden Island. There he stayed for\na time until the merchant had finished his buying and selling. Now on the way\nback, he saw a magic tree suddenly rising from the ocean. It had beautiful\nbranches, boughs of gold, fruits of jewels, and splendid blossoms. And sitting\non a jewelled couch in the branches was a lovely maiden of heavenly beauty.\nAnd while the counsellor wondered what it all meant, the maiden took her lute\nin her hand, and began to sing:\n\nWhatever seed of fate is sown,  \nThe fruit appears - \'tis strange!  \nWhatever deed a man has done,  \nNot God himself can change.\n\nAnd when she had made her meaning clear, the heavenly maiden straightway sank\nwith the magic tree and the couch. And Farsight thought: "What a wonderful\nthing I have seen to-day! What a strange place the ocean is for the appearance\nof a tree with a fairy in it! And if this is a usual occurrence at sea, why do\nnot other goddesses arise?"\n\nThe pilot and other sailors saw that he was astonished, and they said: "Sir,\nthis wonderful maiden appears here regularly, and sinks a moment after, but\nthe sight is new to you." Then the counsellor, filled with amazement, came to\nthe shore with Treasure, and disembarked. And when the merchant had unloaded\nhis goods and caused his servants to rejoice, the counsellor went home with\nhim and spent many happy days there.\n\nAt last he said to Treasure: "Merchant, I have rested happily for a long time\nin your house. Now I wish to go to my own country. Peace be with you!" And in\nspite of urging from the merchant, Farsight took his leave, and started with\nno companion except his own courage. He went through many countries and at\nlast reached the Anga country. And scouts who had been sent by King Glory-\nbanner saw him before he reached the city. When the king learned of it, he\nwent himself out of the city to meet him, for he had been terribly grieved by\nthe separation. He drew near, embraced and greeted the counsellor and took\nhim, all worn and dusty with the weary journey, into an inner room.\n\nAnd as soon as the counsellor was refreshed, the king said: "Counsellor, why\ndid you leave us? How could you bring yourself to do so harsh and loveless a\nthing? But after all, who can understand the strange workings of stern\nnecessity? To think that you should decide all at once to wander off on a\npilgrimage! Well, tell me what countries you visited, and what new things you\nsaw."\n\nThen the counsellor told him the whole story truthfully and in order, the\njourney to Golden Island and the fairy who rose singing from the sea, her\nwonderful beauty and the magic tree.\n\nBut the king immediately fell in love so hopelessly that his kingdom and his\nlife seemed worthless to him without her. He took the counsellor aside and\nsaid: "Counsellor, I simply must see her. Remember that I shall die if I do\nnot. I bow to my fate. I will take the journey which you took. You must not\nrefuse me nor accompany me. I shall go alone and in disguise. You must rule\nthe kingdom, and not dispute my words. Swear to do it on your life."\n\nSo he spoke, and would not listen to advice, but dismissed the counsellor.\nThen Farsight was unhappy though a great festival was made for him. How can a\ngood counsellor be happy when his master devotes himself to a vice?\n\nThe next night King Glory-banner threw the burden of government on that\nexcellent counsellor, assumed the dress of a hermit, and left his city. And as\nhe travelled, he saw a monk named Grass, who said when the king bowed before\nhim as a holy man: "My son, if you sail with a merchant named Fortune, you\nwill obtain the maiden you desire. Go on fearlessly."\n\nSo the king bowed again and went on rejoicing. After crossing rivers and\nmountains he came to the ocean. And on the shore he met at once the merchant\nFortune whom the monk had mentioned, bound for Golden Island. And when the\nmerchant saw the king\'s appearance and his signet ring, he bowed low, took him\non the ship, and set sail.\n\nWhen the ship reached the middle of the sea, the maiden suddenly arose,\nsitting in the branches of the magic tree. And as the king gazed eagerly at\nher, she sang as before to her lute:\n\nWhatever seed of fate is sown  \nThe fruit appears - \'tis strange!  \nWhatever deed a man has done,  \nNot God himself can change.\n\nWhatever, how, for whom, and where  \nTis fated so to be,  \nThat thing, just so, for him, and there  \nMust happen fatally.\n\nThis song she sang, hinting at what was to happen. And the king gazed at her\nsmitten by love, and could not move. Then he cried: "O Sea, in hiding her, you\ndeceive those who think they have your treasures. Honour and glory to you! I\nseek your protection. Grant me my desire!" And as the king prayed, the maiden\nsank with the tree. Then the king jumped after her into the sea.\n\nThe good merchant Fortune thought he was lost and was ready to die of grief.\nBut he was comforted by a voice from heaven which said: "Do nothing rash.\nThere is no danger when he sinks in the sea. For he is the king Glory-banner,\ndisguised as a hermit. He came here for the sake of the maiden; she was his\nwife in a former life. And he will win her and return to his kingdom in the\nAnga country." So the merchant sailed on to complete his  business.\n\nBut King Glory-banner sank in the sea, and all at once he saw aheavenly city.\nHe looked in amazement at the balconies with their splendid jewelled pillars,\ntheir walls bright with gold, and the network of pearls in their windows. And\nhe saw gardens with pools that had stairways of various gems, and magic trees\nthat yielded all desires. But rich as it was, the city was deserted.\n\nHe entered house after house, but did not find the maiden anywhere. Then he\nclimbed a high balcony built of gems, opened a door, and entered. And there he\nsaw her all alone, lying on a jewelled couch, and clad in splendid garments.\nHe eagerly raised her face to see if it was really she, and saw that it was\nindeed the maiden he sought. At the sight of her he had the strange feeling of\nthe traveller in a desert in summer at the sight of a river.\n\nAnd she opened her eyes, saw that he was handsome and loveable, and left her\ncouch in confusion. But she welcomed him and with downcast eyes that seemed\nlike full-blown lotuses she did honour to his feet. Then she slowly spoke:\n"Who are you, sir? How did you come to this inaccessible under-world? And what\nis this hermit garb? For I see that you are a king. Oh, sir, if you would do\nme a kindness, tell me this."\n\nAnd the king answered her: "Beautiful maiden, I am King Glory-banner of the\nAnga country, and I heard from a reliable person that you were to be seen on\nthe sea. To see you I assumed this garb, left my kingdom, and followed you\nhither. Oh, tell me who you are."\n\nThen she said to him with bashful love: "Sir, there is a king of the fairies\nnamed Moonshine. I am his daughter, and my name is Moonlight. Now my father\nhas left me alone in this city. I do not know where he went with the rest of\nthe people, or why. Therefore, as my home is lonely, I rise through the ocean,\nsit on a magic tree, and song about fate."\n\nThen the king remembered the words of the monk, and urged her with such\ngentle, tender words that she confessed her love and agreed to marry him. But\nshe made a condition: "My dear, on four set days in each month you must let me\ngo somewhere unhindered and unseen. There is a reason." And the king agreed,\nmarried her, and lived in heavenly happiness with her.\n\nWhile he was living in heavenly bliss, Moonlight said to him one day: "My\ndear, you must wait here. I am going somewhere on an errand. For this is one\nof the set days. While you stay here, sweetheart, you must not go into that\ncrystal room, nor plunge into this pool. If you do, you will find yourself at\nthat very moment in the world again." So she said good-bye and left the city.\n\nBut the king took his sword and followed, to learn her secret. And he saw a\ngiant approaching with a great black cave of a mouth that yawned like the pit.\nThe giant fell down and howled horribly, then took Moonlight into his mouth\nand swallowed her.\n\nAnd the king\'s anger blazed forth. He took his great sword, black as a snake\nthat has sloughed its skin, ran up wrathfully, and cut off the giant\'s head.\nHe was blinded by his madness, he did not know what to do, he was afflicted by\nthe loss of his darling. But Moonlight split open the stomach of the giant,\nand came out alive and unhurt, like the brilliant, spotless moon coming out\nfrom a black cloud.\n\nWhen he saw that she was saved, the king cried: "Come, come to me!" and ran\nforward and embraced her. And he asked her: "What does it mean, dearest? Is\nthis a dream, or an illusion?" And the fairy answered: "My dear, listen to me.\nIt is not a dream, nor an illusion. My father, the king of the fairies, laid\nthis curse upon me. My father had many sons, but he loved me so that he could\nnot eat without me. And I used to come to this deserted spot twice a month to\nworship Shiva.\n\n"One day I came here and it happened that I spent the whole day in worship.\nThat day my father waited for me and would not eat or drink anything, though\nhe was hungry and angry with me. At night I stood before him with downcast\neyes, for I had done wrong. And he forgot his love and cursed me--so strong is\nfate. Because you have despised me and left me hungry a whole day, a giant\nnamed Terror-of-Fate will swallow you four times a month when you leave the\ncity. And each time you will split him open and come out. And you shall not\nremember the curse afterwards, nor the pain of being swallowed alive. And you\nmust live here alone.\'\n\n"But when I begged him, he thought awhile and softened his curse. When Glory-\nbanner, King of the Angas, shall become your husband, and shall see you\nswallowed by the giant, and shall kill the giant, then the curse shall end,\nand you shall remember all your magic arts.\' Then he left me here, and went\nwith his people to the Nishadha mountain. But I stayed here because of the\ncurse. And now the curse is ended, and I remember everything. So now I shall\ngo to the Nishadha mountain to see my father. Of course now I remember how to\nfly. And you are at liberty to stay here, or to go back to your own kingdom."\n\nThen the king was sad, and he begged her thus: "My beautiful wife, do not go\nfor seven days. Be as kind as you are beautiful. Let me be happy with you in\nthe garden, and forget my longings. Then you may go to your father, and I will\ngo home." So he persuaded her, and was happy with her for six days in the\ngarden. And the lilies in the ponds looked like longing eyes, and the ripples\nlike hands raised to detain them, and the cries of swans and cranes seemed to\nsay: "Do not leave us and go away."\n\nOn the seventh day the king cleverly led his wife to the pool from which one\ncould get back to the world. There he threw his arms about her and plunged\ninto the pool, and came up with her in the pool in the garden of his own\npalace.\n\nThe gardeners saw that the king had come back with a wife, and they joyfully\nran and told the counsellor Farsight. He came and fell at the king\'s feet, and\nthen led the king and the fairy into the palace. And the counsellor and the\npeople thought: "Wonderful! The king has won the fairy whom others could see\nonly for a moment like the lightning in the sky. Whatever is written in one\'s\nfate, that comes true, however impossible it may be."\n\nBut when Moonlight saw that the king was in his own country, and the seven\ndays were over, she thought she would fly away like other fairies. But she\ncould not remember how. Then she became very sad, like a woman who has been\nrobbed.\n\nAnd the king said: "Why are you so sad, my dear? Tell me." And the fairy said:\n"The curse is over. Yet because I have been bound so long in the fetters of\nyour love, I have lost my magic arts. I cannot fly." Then the king thought:\n"The fairy is really mine," and he was happy and made a great feast.\n\nWhen the counsellor Farsight saw this, he went home, and lay down on his bed,\nand his heart broke, and he died. Then the king governed the kingdom himself,\nand lived for a long time in heavenly happiness with Moonlight.\n\n\n\nWhen he had told this story, the goblin said: "O King, when the king was so\nhappy, why should the counsellor\'s heart break? Was it from grief because he\ndid not win the fairy himself? Or from sorrow because the king came back, and\nhe could no longer act as king? If you know and will not tell me, then you\nwill lose your virtue, and your head will go flying into a hundred pieces."\n\nAnd the king said to the goblin: "O magic creature, neither of these reasons\nwould be possible for a high-minded counsellor. But he thought: The king used\nto neglect his duties for the sake of ordinary women. What will happen now,\nwhen he loves a fairy? In spite of all my efforts, a terrible misfortune has\nhappened.\' I think that was why his heart broke."\n\nThen the magic goblin went back to his tree in a moment. And the king was\nstill determined to catch him, and went once more to the sissoo tree.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Twelfth Goblin: The Brahman who died because Poison from a Snake in the\nClaws of a Hawk fell into a Dish of Food given him by a Charitable Woman.
