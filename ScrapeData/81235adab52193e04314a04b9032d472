They preserve, no doubt, many ancient notions and\ntraditions; but these have been so much mixed up with foreign matter, intended\nto favour the popularity of particular forms of worship or articles of faith,\nthat they cannot be unreservedly recognised as genuine representations of what\nwe have reason to believe the Puran\xcc\x81as originally were.\n\nThe safest sources for the ancient legends of the Hindus, after the Vedas, are\nno doubt the two great poems, the Ramayan\xcc\x81a and Mahabharata. The first offers\nonly a few, but they are of a primitive character. The Mahabharata is more\nfertile in fiction, but it is more miscellaneous, and much that it contains is\nof equivocal authenticity, and uncertain date. Still it affords many materials\nthat are genuine, and it is evidently the great fountain from which most, if\nnot all, of the Puran\xcc\x81as have drawn; as it intimates itself, when it declares\nthat there is no legend current in the world which has not its origin in the\nMahabharata 84.\n\nA work of some extent professing to be part of the Mahabharata may more\naccurately be ranked with the Pauran\xcc\x81ik compilations of least authenticity,\nand latest origin. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba is chiefly occupied with the adventures of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, but, as introductory to his era, it records particulars of the\ncreation of the world, and of the patriarchal and regal\n\np. lix\n\ndynasties. This is done with much carelessness and inaccuracy of compilation,\nas I have had occasion frequently to notice in the following pages. The work\nhas been very industriously translated by M. Langlois.\n\nA comparison of the subjects of the following pages with those of the other\nPuran\xcc\x81as will sufficiently shew that of the whole series the Vishn\xcc\x81u most\nclosely conforms to the definition of a Pancha-lakshan\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81a, or one which\ntreats of five specified topics. It comprehends them all; and although it has\ninfused a portion of extraneous and sectarial matter, it has done so with\nsobriety and with judgment, and has not suffered the fervour of its religious\nzeal to transport it into very wide deviations from the prescribed path. The\nlegendary tales which it has inserted are few, and are conveniently arranged,\nso that they do not distract the attention of the compiler from objects of\nmore permanent interest and importance.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lviii:84](vp024.htm#fr_83) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_05800.jpg) 'Unconnected with this narrative, no story is\nknown upon earth.'
