He\ncame near to Pravaha _n_ a _G_ aivali 4, who was walking about (surrounded by\nhis men). As soon as he (the king) saw him, he said: \'My boy!\' _S_ vetaketu\nreplied: \'Sir!\'\n\nThen the king said: \'Have you been taught by your father!\' \'Yes,\' he replied.\n\n2\\. The king said: \'Do you know how men, when they depart from here, separate\nfrom each other?\' \'No,\' he replied.\n\n\'Do you know how they come back to this world?\' \'No,\' he replied 5.\n\np. 205\n\n\'Do you know how that world does never become full with the many who again and\nagain depart thither?\' \'No,\' he replied.\n\n\'Do you know at the offering of which libation the waters become endowed with\na human voice and rise and speak?\' \'No,\' he replied.\n\n\'Do you know the access to the path leading to the Devas and to the path\nleading to the Fathers, i.e. by what deeds men gain access to the path leading\nto the Devas or to that leading to the Fathers? For we have heard even the\nsaying of a _Ri_ shi: "I heard of two paths for men, one leading to the\nFathers, the other leading to the Devas. On those paths all that lives moves\non, whatever there is between father (sky) and mother (earth)."\'\n\n_S_ vetaketu said: \'I do not know even one of all these questions.\'\n\n3\\. Then the king invited him to stay and accept his hospitality. But the boy,\nnot caring for hospitality, ran away, went back to his father, and said: \'Thus\nthen you called me formerly well-instructed!\' The father said: \'What then, you\nsage?\' The son replied: \'That fellow of a Ra _g_ anya asked me five questions,\nand I did not know one of them.\'\n\n\'What were they?\' said the father.\n\n\'These were they,\' the son replied, mentioning the different heads.\n\n4\\. The father said: \'You know me, child, that whatever I know, I told you.\nBut come, we shall go thither, and dwell there as students.\'\n\n\'You may go, Sir,\' the son replied.\n\np. 206\n\nThen Gautama went where (the place of) Pravaha _n_ a Gaivali was, and the king\noffered him a seat, ordered water for him, and gave him the proper offerings.\nThen he said to him: \'Sir, we offer a boon to Gautama.\'\n\n5\\. Gautama said: \'That boon is promised to me; tell me the same speech which\nyou made in the presence of my boy.\'\n\n6\\. He said: \'That belongs to divine boons, name one of the human boons.\'\n\n7\\. He said: \'You know well that I have plenty of gold, plenty of cows,\nhorses, slaves, attendants, and apparel; do not heap on me 1 what I have\nalready in plenty, in abundance, and superabundance.\'\n\nThe king said: \'Gautama, do you wish (for instruction from me) in the proper\nway?\'\n\nGautama replied: \'I come to you as a pupil.\'\n\nIn word only have former sages (though Brahmans) come as pupils (to people of\nlower rank), but Gautama actually dwelt as a pupil (of Pravaha _n_ a, who was\na Ra _g_ anya) in order to obtain the fame of having respectfully served his\nmaster 2.\n\np. 207\n\n8\\. The king said: \'Do not be offended with us, neither you nor your\nforefathers, because this knowledge has before now never dwelt with any Brahma\n_n_ a 1. But I shall tell it to you, for who could refuse you when you speak\nthus?\n\n9\\. \'The altar (fire), O Gautama, is that world (heaven) 2; the fuel is the\nsun itself, the smoke his rays, the light the day, the coals the quarters, the\nsparks the intermediate quarters. On that altar the Devas offer the _s_ raddha\nlibation (consisting of water 3). From that oblation rises Soma, the king (the\nmoon).\n\n10\\. \'The altar, O Gautama, is Par _g_ anya (the god of rain); the fuel is the\nyear itself, the smoke the clouds, the light the lightning, the coals the\nthunderbolt, the sparks the thunderings. On that altar the Devas offer Soma,\nthe king (the moon). From that oblation rises rain.\n\n11\\. \'The altar, O Gautama, is this world 4; the fuel is the earth itself, the\nsmoke the fire, the light the night, the coals the moon, the sparks the stars.\nOn that altar the Devas offer rain. From that oblation rises food.\n\np. 208\n\n12\\. \'The altar, O Gautama, is man; the fuel the opened mouth, the smoke the\nbreath, the light the tongue, the coals the eye, the sparks the ear. On that\naltar the Devas offer food. From that oblation rises seed.\n\n13\\. \'The altar, O Gautama, is woman 1. On that altar the Devas offer seed.\nFrom that oblation rises man. He lives so long as he lives, and then when he\ndies,\n\n14\\. \'They take him to the fire (the funeral pile), and then the altar-fire is\nindeed fire, the fuel fuel, the smoke smoke, the light light, the coals coals,\nthe sparks sparks. In that very altar-fire the Devas offer man, and from that\noblation man rises, brilliant in colour.\n\n15\\. \'Those who thus know this (even G _ri_ hasthas), and those who in the\nforest worship faith and the True 2 (Brahman Hira _n_ yagarbha), go to light\n(ar _k_ is), from light to day, from day to the increasing half, from the\nincreasing half to the six months when the sun goes to the north, from those\nsix months to the world of the Devas (Devaloka), from the world of the Devas\nto the sun, from the sun to the place of lightning. When they have thus\nreached the place of lightning a spirit 3 comes near them, and leads them to\nthe worlds of the (conditioned) Brahman. In these worlds of Brahman they dwell\nexalted for ages. There is no returning for them.\n\np. 209\n\n16\\. \'But they who conquer the worlds (future states) by means of sacrifice,\ncharity, and austerity, go to smoke, from smoke to night, from night to the\ndecreasing half of the moon, from the decreasing half of the moon to the six\nmonths when the sun goes to the south, from these months to the world of the\nfathers, from the world of the fathers to the moon. Having reached the moon,\nthey become food, and then the Devas feed on them there, as sacrificers feed\non Soma, as it increases and decreases 1. But when this (the result of their\ngood works on earth) ceases, they return again to that ether, from ether to\nthe air, from the air to rain, from rain to the earth. And when they have\nreached the earth, they become food, they are offered again in the altar-fire,\nwhich is man (see \xc2\xa7 11), and thence are born in the fire of woman. Thus they\nrise up towards the worlds, and go the same round as before.\n\n\'Those, however, who know neither of these two paths, become worms, birds,,\nand creeping things.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[204:3](sbe15095.htm#fr_597) See _Kh_ and. Up. V, 3; Muir, Original Sanskrit\nTexts, I, 433; Deussen, Vedanta, p. 390. The commentator treats this chapter\nas a supplement, to explain the ways that lead to the pit _ri_ loka and the\ndevaloka.\n\n[204:4](sbe15095.htm#fr_598) The MSS. I. O. 375 and 1973 give _G_ aivali,\nothers _G_ aibali. He is a Kshatriya sage, who appears also in _Kh_ and. Up.\nI, 8, 1, as silencing Brahma _n_ as.\n\n[204:5](sbe15095.htm#fr_599) The same question is repeated in Roer\'s edition,\nonly substituting p. 205 sampadyante for apadyante. The MSS. I. O. 375 and\n1973 do not support this.\n\n[206:1](sbe15095.htm#fr_600) Abhyavadanya is explained as niggardly, or\nunwilling to give, and derived from vadanya, liberal, a-vadanya, illiberal,\nand abhi, towards. This, however, is an impossible form in Sanskrit. Vadanya\nmeans liberal, and stands for avadanya, this being derived from avadana, lit.\nwhat is cut off, then a morsel, a gift. In abhyavadanya the original a\nreappears, so that abhyavadanya means, not niggardly, but on the contrary,\nliberal, i.e. giving more than is required. Avadanya has never been met with\nin the sense of niggardly, and though a rule of Pa _n_ ini sanctions the\nformation of a-vadanya, it does not say in what sense. Abhyavada in the sense\nof cutting off in addition occurs in _S_ atap. Br. II, 5, 2, 40; avadana _m_\nkaroti, in the sense of making a present, occurs Maitr. Up. VI, 33.\n\n[206:2](sbe15095.htm#fr_601) The commentator takes the opposite view. In times\nof distress, he says, former sages, belonging to a higher caste, have p. 207\nsubmitted to become pupils to teachers of a lower caste, not, however, in\norder to learn, but simply in order to live. Therefore Gautama also becomes a\npupil in name only, for it would be against all law to act otherwise. See\nGautama, Dharma-sutras VII, i, ed, Stenzler; translated by Buhler, p. 209.\n\n[207:1](sbe15095.htm#fr_602) Here, too, my translation is hypothetical, and\ndiffers widely from _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara.\n\n[207:2](sbe15095.htm#fr_603) Cf. _Kh_ and. Up. V, 4.\n\n[207:3](sbe15095.htm#fr_604) Deussen translates In diesem Feuer opfern die\nGotter den Glauben.\'\n\n[207:4](sbe15095.htm#fr_605) Here a distinction is made between aya _m_ loka,\nthis world, and p _ri_ thivi, earth, while in the _Kh_ and. Up. aya _m_ loka\nis the earth, asau loka the heaven.\n\n[208:1](sbe15095.htm#fr_606) Tasya upastha eva samil, lomani dhumo, yonir ar\n_k_ ir, yad anta _h_ karoti te \'\xe1\xb9\x85gara, abhinanda visphuli\xe1\xb9\x85ga _h_.\n\n[208:2](sbe15095.htm#fr_607) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara translates, \'those who with faith\nworship the True,\' and this seems better.\n\n[208:3](sbe15095.htm#fr_608) \'A person living in the Brahma-world, sent forth,\ni.e. created, by Brahman, by the mind,\' _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara. \'Der ist nicht wie ein\nMensch,\' Deussen, p. 392.\n\n[209:1](sbe15095.htm#fr_609) See note 4 on _Kh_ and. Up. V, 10, and Deussen,\nVedanta, p. 393. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara guards against taking apyayasvapakshiyasva as a\nmantra. A similar construction is _g_ ayasva m _ri_ yasva, see _Kh_ and. Up.\nV, 10, 8.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 3](sbe15096.htm)\n\n'
