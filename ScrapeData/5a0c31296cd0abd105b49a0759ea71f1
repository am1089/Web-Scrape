And when the Hot _ri_ recites this (verse), \'Let Brahma _n_ aspati\ngo forward, let the goddess Sun _ri_ ta go forward,\'--the Adhvaryu, stepping\nforward, makes offering (by muttering) the wind-names. For at this time the\ngods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya)\nof theirs in the middle (of the sacrifice): they offered it with the Svaha-\ncall before (its being taken to) the \xc3\x82havaniya, being thus offered they\noffered it (again) in the fire; and in like manner does this one now offer it\nwith the Svaha-call before\n\np. 479\n\n[paragraph continues] (its being taken to) the \xc3\x82havaniya, and being thus\noffered he offers it (again) in the fire.\n\n14:2:2:22\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 7,] \'To the wind Ocean (I offer) thee, hail!\'\n--the (aerial) ocean (samudra) indeed is he who blows here, for from out of\nthat ocean all the gods and all the beings issue forth (samud-dru): it is to\nhim (Vayu, the wind) he thus offers it, and therefore he says, \'To the wind\nOcean (I consecrate) thee, hail!\'\n\n14:2:2:33\\. \'To the wind Flood--thee, hail!\'--the flood (sarira) indeed is he\nwho blows here, for from out of that flood all the gods and all the creatures\ncome forth together (saha irate): it is to him he thus offers it, and\ntherefore he says, \'To the wind Flood--thee, hail!\'\n\n14:2:2:44\\. \'To the wind Unassailable--thee, hail! To the wind Irresistible--\nthee, hail!\'--unassailable and irresistible indeed is he who blows here: it is\nto him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, \'To the wind Unassailable--\nthee, hail! To the wind Irresistible--thee, hail!\'\n\n14:2:2:55\\. \'To the wind Favourable--thee, hail! To the wind Ogress-ridder--\nthee, hail!\'--favourable and an ogress-ridder indeed is he who blows here: it\nis to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, \'To the wind Favourable--\nthee, hail! To the wind Ogress-ridder--thee, hail!\'\n\n14:2:2:66\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 8,] \'To Indra, accompanied by the Vasus and\nRudras, (I offer) thee, hail!\'--Indra indeed is he who blows here: it is to\nhim he thus offers it, and therefore he says, \'To Indra--thee;\' and when he\nsays, \'accompanied by the Vasus and Rudras,\' thereby he allows a share to the\nVasus and Rudras along with Indra; and,\n\np. 480\n\nmoreover, it is thereby made to be like the morning Soma-pressing, and the\nmidday-pressing 1.\n\n14:2:2:77\\. \'To Indra, accompanied by the \xc3\x82dityas,--thee, hail!\'--Indra indeed\nis he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says,\n\'To Indra--thee;\' and when he says, \'accompanied by the \xc3\x82dityas,\' thereby he\nallows a share to the \xc3\x82dityas along with Indra; and, moreover, it is made like\nthe evening-pressing 1.\n\n14:2:2:88\\. \'To Indra, the slayer of the evil-minded,--thee, hail!\'--Indra\nindeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he\nsays, \'To Indra--thee;\' and as to his saying, \'to the slayer of the evil-\nminded,\' the evil-minded one being an enemy, he thereby means to say, \'To\nIndra, the slayer of enemies,--thee!\' This is his (Indra\'s) special share:\neven as there is a share for a chief 2, so is this his (share) apart from the\n(other) gods.\n\n14:2:2:99\\. \'To Savit _ri_ , accompanied by the _Ri_ bhus, the Vibhus (lords),\nand the Va _g_ as (powers),--thee, hail!\'--Savit _ri_ (the sun) indeed is he\nwho blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, \'To\nSavit _ri_ , accompanied by the _Ri_ bhus, the Vibhus, and the Va _g_ as,--\nthee!\' He thus allows a share therein to all the gods along (with Savit _ri_\n).\n\n14:2:2:1010\\. \'To B _ri_ haspati, accompanied by the All-gods,--thee, hail!\'--\nB _ri_ haspati indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers\n\np. 481\n\nit, and therefore he says, \'To B _ri_ haspati--thee;\' and when he says,\n\'accompanied by the All-gods,\' he thereby allows a share therein to all the\ngods along (with B _ri_ haspati).\n\n14:2:2:1111\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 9,] \'To Yama, accompanied by the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras\nand the Fathers,--thee, hail!\'--Yama indeed is he who blows here: it is to him\nhe thus offers it, and therefore he says, \'To Yama--thee;\' and as to his\nsaying, \'accompanied by the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras and the Fathers,\'--when the sacrifice had\nits head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers,--the\nFathers being three in number 1: thus it is to these he thereby allows a share\nalong (with Yama).\n\n14:2:2:1212\\. These are twelve names,--twelve months are in a year, and the\nyear is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it\nis him he thereby pleases, and therefore there are twelve (names).\n\n14:2:2:1313\\. He then pours (the spilt milk and ghee) from the tray into the\nMahavira (pot) with, \'Hail to the Gharma!\'--the Gharma (hot draught) is he who\nshines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him he thereby\npleases, and therefore he says, \'Hail to the Gharma!\'--the call of \'hail!\' he\nplaces first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as\nbefore 2.\n\n14:2:2:1414\\. When it has been poured in, he mutters, \'Hail, the Gharma to the\nFathers!\' When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed\n\np. 482\n\naway, and went to the Fathers--the Fathers being three in number: it is these\nhe thus pleases. The call of \'hail!\' he places first, and the deity last: the\nsignificance of this is the same as before.\n\n14:2:2:1515\\. He recites no anuvakya (invitatory) formula, for once for all\nthe Fathers have passed away: therefore he recites no anuvakya. Having stepped\nacross 1, and called (on the \xc3\x82gnidhra) for the Srausha _t_  2, he (the\nAdhvaryu) says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Pronounce the offering-formula (ya _g_ ya)\nof the Gharma;\' and on the Vasha _t_ -call being uttered he offers--\n\n14:2:2:1616\\. With (Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 10), \'All regions (hath he\nworshipped), seated in the south,\'--that is to say, \'every region (has he\nworshipped), seated on the south;\'--\'all gods hath he worshipped here,\'--that\nis, \'every god has he worshipped here;\'--\'of the sweet Gharma, consecrated by\nSvaha (hail!), drink ye, O A _s_ vins!\'--with regard to the A _s_ vins he says\nthis; for the A _s_ vins restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he\nthus pleases. The call of \'hail!\' he places first, and the deity last: the\nsignificance of this is the same as before.\n\n14:2:2:1717\\. And, having offered, he (thrice) shakes (the Mahavira) upwards,\nwith (Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 11), \'In heaven place thou this sacrifice! this\nsacrifice place thou in heaven!\'--for the Gharma (hot milk-draught), the\nsacrifice, is yonder sun, and he indeed is \'placed\' in the heavens, is\n\np. 483\n\nestablished in the heavens: it is thus him he thereby pleases, and therefore\nhe says, \'In heaven place thou this sacrifice! this sacrifice place thou in\nheaven!\' On the repetition of the Vasha _t_ , he offers--\n\n14:2:2:1818\\. With, \'Hail to Agni, worthy of sacrifice!\'--this is in lieu of\nthe Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (offering), for Agni is the maker of good\noffering;--\'may blessing result from the sacrificial texts!\' for by the\nsacrificial texts that (sun) is established (as the Mahavira) in this world:\nthus it is them he thereby pleases. The call of \'hail!\' he places first, and\nthe deity last: the significance of this is the same as before.\n\n14:2:2:1919\\. The Brahman (priest) pronounces the anumantra _n_ a (formula of\nconsecration); for the Brahman is the best physician among the officiating\npriests: thus he heals this sacrifice by means of him who is the best\nphysician among the priests.\n\n14:2:2:2020\\. [He does so, with Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 12.] \'O A _s_ vins, drink\nye the Gharma!\'--with regard to the A _s_ vins he says this, for the A _s_\nvins restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases.\n\n14:2:2:2121\\. \'The hearty 1 one with daily 2 favours,\'--\n\np. 484\n\nthis is indistinct, for Pra _g_ apati is indistinct (undefined), and the\nsacrifice is Pra _g_ apati: Pra _g_ apati, the sacrifice, he thus heals;--\n\n14:2:2:2222\\. \'To the web-weaver,\'--the web-weaver, doubtless, is he that\nshines yonder, for he moves along these worlds as if along a web; and the\nPravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him he thereby pleases, and therefore\nhe says, \'To the web-weaver\'--\n\n14:2:2:2323\\. \'To Heaven and Earth be reverence!\' he thus propitiates heaven\nand earth, within which everything here is contained.\n\n14:2:2:2424\\. Thereupon the Sacrificer (mutters),--the Sacrificer being the\nsacrifice, he thus heals the sacrifice by means of the sacrifice;--\n\n14:2:2:2525\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 13,] \'The A _s_ vins drank the Gharma,\'--he\nsays this with regard to the A _s_ vins, for the A _s_ vins restored the head\nof the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases.\n\n14:2:2:2626\\. \'Heaven and Earth have approved of it 1\'--he says this with\nregard to heaven and earth, within which everything here is contained;--\'may\ngifts accrue here!\'--whereby he means to say, \'may there be riches for us\nhere.\'\n\n14:2:2:2727\\. The rising (milk) he then consecrates by the anumantra _n_ a 2,\n\'For freshness swell thou!\'\n\np. 485\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--whereby he means to say, \'For rain . . .;\'--\'for\nvigour swell thou!\'--he thereby means the vigour, the life-sap, which results\nfrom the rain;--\'for the Brahman swell thou!\'---he thereby means the\npriesthood;--\'for the Kshatra swell thou!\'--he thereby means the\nnobility;--\'for Heaven and Earth swell thou!\'--he thereby means these two, the\nheaven and the earth, within which everything here is contained.\n\n14:2:2:2828\\. When it rises upwards; it rises for (the benefit of) the\nSacrificer; when on the front side, it does so for the gods; when on the right\n(south) side, it does so for the Fathers; when at the back (west side), it\ndoes so for the cattle; when on the left (north) side, it does so for (the\nSacrificer\'s) offspring: in any case no fault is incurred by the Sacrificer,\nfor it always rises upwards; and in whatever direction it rises in that it\nrises. When the drops cease,--\n\n14:2:2:2929\\. He steps out towards the north-east with, \'A well-supporting\nsupport thou art,\'--he who shines yonder is indeed a support, for he supports\neverything here, and by him everything here is supported; and the Pravargya\nalso is that (sun): thus it is him he thereby, pleases, and therefore he says,\n\'A well-supporting support thou art.\'\n\n14:2:2:3030\\. He then places (the Mahavira) on the mound with, \'Incapable of\ninjuring, preserve thou our powers!\'--\'Not angry 1, preserve our wealth,\'\n\np. 486\n\nis what he thereby means to say;--\'preserve the priesthood, preserve the\nnobility, preserve the people!\'--\'preserve all that,\' is what he thereby means\nto say.\n\n14:2:2:3131\\. He then offers by means of the pieces of (split) wood 1,--the\npieces of wood being the vital airs, it is the vital airs he thus bestows upon\nhim;--\n\n14:2:2:3232\\. With (Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 15), \'Hail to Pushan, to the cream!\'--\nPushan, doubtless, is he who blows here, for he (the wind) supports (push)\neverything here; and the breath also is that (wind): it is breath he thus\nbestows upon him, whence he says, \'Hail to Pushan, to the cream!\' The call of\n\'hail!\' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the\nsame as before. Having offered (by means of the first piece) he leans it\nagainst the middle enclosing-stick 2 (paridhi).\n\n14:2:2:3333\\. \'Hail to the pressing-stones!\'--the pressing-stones being the\nvital airs, it is the vital airs he thus bestows upon him. Having offered\n(with the second stick) he leans it against the middle enclosing-stick.\n\n14:2:2:3434\\. \'Hail to the sounding-holes 3!\'--the\n\np. 487\n\nsounding-holes (pratirava), doubtless, are the vital airs, for everything here\nis pleased (pratirata) with the vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus\nbestows upon him. Having offered (with the third stick) he leans it against\nthe middle enclosing-stick.\n\n14:2:2:3535\\. \'Hail to the Fathers, (seated) upon the Barhis 1, and drinking\nthe Gharma!\'--even without offering he secretes (this, the fourth stick) under\nthe barhis of the south part (of the vedi 2) whilst looking towards the north\n3. When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went\nto the Fathers--the Fathers being three in number: it is them he thus pleases.\nAnd\n\np. 488\n\nas to why he does not look at it,--once for all the Fathers have passed away.\n\n14:2:2:3636\\. \'Hail to Heaven and Earth!\'--heaven and earth being the out (and\nin)-breathing and the up-breathing, it is the out and up-breathing he thus\nbestows upon him. Having offered (with the fifth stick) he leans it against\nthe middle enclosing-stick.\n\n14:2:2:3737\\. \'Hail to the All-gods!\'--the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ being the vital\nairs, it is the vital airs he thus bestows upon him. Having offered (with the\nsixth stick) he leans it against the middle enclosing-stick.\n\n14:2:2:3838\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 16,] \'Hail to Rudra, praised by the Rudras\n1!\'--even without offering (with this, the seventh stick), he, looking\nsouthwards, hands it to the Pratiprasthat _ri_ , and the latter throws it\noutside (the offering-ground) northwards to the north of the hall, for this is\nthe region of that god: he thus gratifies him in his own region. And as to why\nhe does not look at it, he does so thinking, \'Lest Rudra should do me harm.\'\n\n14:2:2:3939\\. There are seven of these oblations, for seven in number are\nthese (channels of the) vital airs in the head: it is these he thus bestows\nupon him.\n\n14:2:2:4040\\. He then pours (the remaining milk and ghee) from the Mahavira\ninto the supporting-tray with, \'Hail, light with light!\'--for light indeed the\nmilk was in the one (vessel), and light it is in the other, and these two\nlights thus unite with each other. The call of \'hail!\' he places first, and\nthe deity last: the mystic import of this is the same as before.\n\np. 489\n\n14:2:2:4141\\. He then offers (the second of) the two Rauhi _n_ a 1 (cakes)\nwith, \'May the day be pleased with its brightness, the well-lighted with its\nlight, hail!\'--the mystic import of this is the same as before;--\'may the\nnight be pleased with its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!\'\n--the mystic import of this is the same as before.\n\n14:2:2:4242\\. He then hands to the Sacrificer the remainder of the Gharma. He,\nhaving solicited an invitation 2 (to the meal), drinks it with, \'Offered is\nthe honey unto Agni, the greatest of Indras,\'--\'Offered is the honey unto\nAgni, the most powerful,\' he thereby means to say; \'let us eat of thee, god\nGharma: reverence be unto thee, injure us not!\'--a blessing he thereby\ninvokes.\n\n14:2:2:4343\\. Now, on the south side sand has been strewn; there they cleanse\nthemselves 3: in this there is the\n\np. 490\n\nsame significance as in the Mar _g_ aliya. The pieces of wood he throws into\nthe fire. They then proceed with the Upasad. And thus the head of the\nsacrifice has been set right in the very same manner in which the A _s_ vins\nthen restored it.\n\n14:2:2:4444\\. One must not perform the Pravargya at one\'s first Soma-\nsacrifice, since that would be sinful, and lest Indra should cut off his head;\nbut at the second or the third (Soma-sacrifice); for at first the gods went on\nworshipping and toiling with the headless sacrifice, therefore (he should do\nso) at the second or the third (sacrifice). Moreover, it will become heated\nand ablaze;--\n\n14:2:2:4545\\. And were he to perform the Pravargya at the first Soma-\nsacrifice, that (Mahavira) of his, when heated and ablaze, would burn up his\nfamily and cattle, and also his life, and the Sacrificer would be liable to\nperish: therefore (let him perform it) at the second or third (sacrifice).\n\n14:2:2:4646\\. Let him not perform the Pravargya for any and every one, lest he\nshould do everything for every one, for the Pravargya is everything; but let\nhim only perform it for him who is known, or to whoever may be dear to him, or\nwho has studied sacred writ: by means of the study of sacred writ he would\nthus gain it.\n\n14:2:2:4747\\. One may perform the Pravargya for a thousand (head of cattle) 1,\nfor a thousand means everything, and that (Pravargya) is everything. One may\n\np. 491\n\nperform it for all (the Sacrificer\'s) property; for all one\'s property means\neverything, and this (Pravargya) is everything. One may perform it at a Vi _s_\nva _g_ it with all the P _ri_ sh _th_ as 1; for the Vi _s_ va _g_ it (all-\nconquering day) with all the P _ri_ sh _th_ as means everything, and this\n(Pravargya) is everything One may perform it at the Va _g_ apeya (and) Ra _g_\nasuya, for such (a ceremony) means everything. One may perform it at a\nsacrificial session, for the session means everything, and this (Pravargya) is\neverything. These are (the occasions for) his performances of the Pravargya,\nand (let him perform it) nowhere else but at these.\n\n14:2:2:4848\\. Here now they say, \'Seeing that the Pravargya is headless,\nwhereby, then, does the Agnihotra become possessed of a head for him?\' Let him\nsay, \'By the \xc3\x82havaniya.\'--\'How the New and Full-moon sacrifices?\' Let him say,\n\'By the ghee and the cake.\'--\'How the Seasonal sacrifices?\' Let him say, \'By\nthe oblation of clotted curds 2.\'--\'How the animal sacrifice?\' Let him say,\n\'By the victim and the cake.\'--\'How the Soma-sacrifice?\' Let him say, \'By the\nHavirdhana 3.\'\n\n14:2:2:4949\\. And they also say,--when the sacrifice had its head cut off, the\ngods on that occasion restored it as the hospitable reception 4 (of King\nSoma), and verily for him who so knows this offering is not made with any\nheadless sacrifice whatever.\n\np. 492\n\n14:2:2:5050\\. And, again, they say, \'Seeing that at the sacrifice they lead\nforward the Pra _n_ ita 1 (water), wherefore do they not lead it forward on\nthis occasion?\' Well, this--to wit, the Pra _n_ ita (water)--being the head of\nthe sacrifice, and the Pravargya also being its head, (he does so) thinking,\n\'Lest I cause the head to be overtopped by a head.\'\n\n14:2:2:5151\\. And, again, they say, \'Seeing that elsewhere there are fore-\nofferings and after-offerings, wherefore are there not any on this occasion?\'\nWell, the fore-offerings and after-offerings being the vital airs, and so also\nthe Avaka _s_ as 2, and the pieces of wood, (it is so) lest he should cause\nthe vital airs to be overtopped by vital airs.\n\n14:2:2:5252\\. And, again, they say, \'Seeing that elsewhere they offer two\nbutter-portions, wherefore does he not offer them on this occasion?\' Well,\nthose two--to wit, the butter-portions--being the eyes of the sacrifice, and\nso also the two Rauhi _n_ a (cakes)--(it is so) lest he should overtop eye by\neye.\n\n14:2:2:5353\\. And, again, they say, \'Seeing that they make offering to the\ngods by means of wooden (vessels), wherefore does he offer this (Gharma) by\nmeans of one made of clay?\' When the Sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-\nsap flowed away and entered the heaven and the earth. Now this (earth) is\nclay, and yonder (sky) is water; and the Mahavira (vessels) are made of clay\nand water: thus he supplies and completes it (the Pravargya) with that life-\nsap.\n\n14:2:2:5454\\. But if it were made of wood, it would be\n\np. 493\n\nburnt; and if of gold, it would dissolve; and if of copper, it would melt; and\nif of stone, it would burn the two handling-sticks; and that (Gharma) itself\nsubmitted to that (earthen vessel): therefore it is by means of an earthen one\nthat he offers it.\n\n14:2:2:5555\\. And, verily, whosoever either, teaches, or partakes of, this\n(Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the\nsame as at the creation 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[480:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1272) See III, 4, 5, 1, where it is stated that the\nmorning-pressing belongs to the Vasus, the midday-pressing to the Rudras, and\nthe third pressing to the \xc3\x82dityas.\n\n[480:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1273) Or, for the best (or eldest brother).

The Taitt.\n\xc3\x82r. has \'hardivanam\' instead. The author of the Brahma _n_ a apparently\nconsiders the term as obscure, and uses this circumstance for his own symbolic\npurposes.\n\n[483:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1279) Perhaps the author means to characterise also\nthe epithet p. 484 \'ahar-diva\' (lit. \'day-daily,\' cf. Germ. tagtaglich;\nAberdonian \'daily-day\') as obscure. Mahidhara takes it to mean \'relating to\nmorning and evening,\' as applying to the two performances of the Pravargya,\n\n[484:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1280) They approved of it by saying \'Well done\';\nMahidh.\n\n[484:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1281) That is, as would seem, he speaks the anumantra\n_n_ a in order to consecrate whatever milk might have been spilled in bubbling\nover. Possibly, however, he is to do so at the time when the pot bubbles over\n(though the \'atha\' would rather be out of place in that case). The Taittiriyas\ndiffer somewhat on this point of the performance. p. 485 After the Gharma-milk\nhas been offered, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ fills the Mahavira pot, whilst it is\nheld over the fire, with boiled sour curds and whey (dadhi), whilst muttering\nthe text, \'The A _s_ vins drank the Gharma . . .,\' and with the texts; \'For\nfreshness swell thou,\' &c.\n\n[485:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1282) The author apparently takes \'ameni\' in the sense\nof \'amanyu.\' p. 486 The St. Petersb. Dict. assigns to it the meaning \'not\nshooting, incapable of shooting.\'\n\n[486:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1283) For these pieces of wood, or large chips, of\nVika\xe1\xb9\x85kata wood (Flacourtia sapida) which were laid round the pot, see [XIV, 1,\n3, 26](sbe44119.htm#14:1:3:26). They are dipped into the remains of the hot\nmilk and ghee, the liquid adhering to them being then offered.\n\n[486:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1284) That is, that one of the three fresh sticks\nenclosing the fire which is laid down first, along the back, or west side, and\nforms the base of a triangle the apex of which points eastwards. Cf. I, 3, 4,\n1 seqq.\n\n[486:3](sbe44122.htm#fr_1285) This meaning is, by the St. Petersb. Dict.,\nassigned to \'prati-rava\' p. 487 (otherwise \'echo\'), the proper term for the\nsounding-holes being \'upa-rava,\' cf. III, 5, 4, 1, where they are likened to\nthe eyes and ears, as channels of the vital airs.\n\n[487:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1286) If this rendering (St. Petersb. Dict.) of\nurdhvabarhis\' is correct--the term being apparently based on the Fathers\'\nepithet \'barhishada _h_ ,\' \'seated on the barhis\' (sacrificial grass-covering\nof the altar-ground)--the force of \'urdhva\' in the compound is very peculiar.\nMahidhara takes it in the sense of \'having their barhis pointed upwards,\' i.e.\ntowards the east (!), the peculiar feature of the barhis in the present case--\nas far as the participation of the Fathers in the drinking of the Gharma is\nconcerned--being its having the tops of the grass-stalks turned to the east\ninstead of to the south, as is the case in all ceremonies relating to the\nFathers. The term \'urdhvabarhis\' might possibly mean \'having their (special)\nbarhis above,\' i.e. in the world of the Fathers, where they would be supposed\nto partake of the libations of hot milk; whilst yet another (suggested by the\nnext paragraph) would be that of \'having the barhis above them;\' which would,\nhowever, be more appropriate if the secreting of the stick under the barhis\napplied to the present, instead of the next one.\n\n[487:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1287) The comm. on Katy. XXVI, 6, 14 calls this part\nof the barhis \'atithyabarhis\' (?).\n\n[487:3](sbe44122.htm#fr_1288) And accordingly, without looking at it.\n\n[488:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1289) Or, \'having his praises sung by the chanters,\'\nas Mahidhara takes \'rudrahuti.\'\n\n[489:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1290) Viz. [XIV, 2, 1, 1](sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:1).\n\n[489:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1291) Viz. at the hands of the officiating priests, by\nsaying to each, Invite me, N.N. whereupon each of them replies, "Thou art\ninvited.\' Cf. XII, 8, 3, 30. According to \xc3\x82past. _S_ r. XV, 11, 12, the\npriests and the Sacrificer partake of the residue in the order--Hot _ri_ ,\nAdhvaryu, Brahman, Pratiprasthat _ri_ , Agnidh, and Sacrificer; or, optionally\n(ib. 14), only the Sacrificer drinks of it, whilst the priests merely smell\nit. Cf. the eating of the whey (of clotted curds), II, 4, 4, 25, to which the\npresent eating of the remains is stated, by Katy. XXVI, 6, 20, to be\nanalogous; whilst the offering is said to be on the model of the Agnihotra.\n\n[489:3](sbe44122.htm#fr_1292) The usual place to do so is over the pit ( _k_\natrala), cf. III, 8, 2, 30; XII, 8, 1, 22; whilst the utensils are cleaned in\nthe Mar _g_ aliya. On the present occasion a mound of sand (or covered with\nsand)--the so-called \'u _k_ _kh_ ish _t_ a-khara\' (mound of remains)--is\nraised in the south part of the _s_ ala, close to the mat or hurdle forming\nits wall, just east of the southern door. According to Katy. XXVI, 6, 21\nseqq., \xc3\x82past. XV, 12, 1 seqq., the Mahavira and the remaining p. 490 apparatus\nare then in solemn fashion (carried round in front of the \xc3\x82havaniya, and)\nplaced on the throne-seat, and consecrated (or appeased) by being sprinkled\nwith water.\n\n[490:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1293) That is, at a sacrifice for which this\nconstitutes the sacrificial fee.\n\n[491:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1294) See [p. 139](sbe44046.htm#page_139), note\n[1](sbe44046.htm#fn_425); and [XII, 3, 3, 6](sbe44055.htm#12:3:3:6).\n\n[491:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1295) For the \'payasya\' see part i, p. 178, note 4; p.\n381, note 2.\n\n[491:3](sbe44122.htm#fr_1296) That is, the cart or carts on which the\noffering-material (including the Soma-plants) is contained, as also the shed\nin which they are placed.\n\n[491:4](sbe44122.htm#fr_1297) See III, 2, 3, 20; 4, 1, 1.\n\n[492:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1298) See part i, p. 9, note.\n\n[492:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1299) See [p. 469](sbe44120.htm#page_469), note\n[1](sbe44120.htm#fn_1243).\n\n[493:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1300) See [p. 458](sbe44118.htm#page_458), note\n[1](sbe44118.htm#fn_1211).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIV, 3, 1.
