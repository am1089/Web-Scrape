For all that, he was, as you say, a\nreal Mahatman, and I would not withdraw a single word I wrote in his praise.\nRamak _ri_ sh _n_ a was not in the least a Vedantist, except that every Hindu\nunconsciously imbibes from the atmosphere around some amount of Vedantism,\nwhich is the philosophical backbone of every national cult. He did not know a\nword of Sanskrit, and it is doubtful whether he knew enough Bengali. His\nspiritual wisdom was the result of genius and practical observation.'\n\nThere is a ring of truth and impartiality about this, and there is no sign of\njealousy, which often breaks out, even in India, among religious reformers and\ntheir followers. As to his filthy language, we must be prepared for much plain\nspeaking among Oriental races. In a country where certain classes of men are\nallowed to walk about in public places stark naked, language too is not likely\nto veil what with us requires to be veiled. There is, however, a great\ndifference between what is filthy and what is meant to he filthy. I doubt\nwhether the charge of intentional filthiness or obscenity, which has been\nbrought against writers like Zola, could be brought, or has ever been brought,\nagainst\n\np. 63\n\n[paragraph continues] Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a. It is quite true that Hindus who\nbelong socially to the higher classes, though not necessarily Brahmans by\nbirth, would be more careful in their expressions. We seldom find any\nblemishes of that kind in the writings of Rammohun Roy, Keshub Chunder Sen,\nand their friends. But a certain directness of speech which would be most\noffensive in England is evidently not regarded in that light in India, and\nevery scholar knows that many of their classical poems, nay, even their Sacred\nWritings, contain passages which simply do not admit of translation into\nEnglish. In the three centuries ( _s_ ataka) of Bhart _ri_ hari, treating of\nworldly wisdom, love, and passionlessness, the second, that of love, has\ngenerally been left out in English translations. But the spirit of that S _ri_\n_m_ gara-Sataka is by no means the same as that of Zola's novels. On the\ncontrary, the object of the poet is to warn people against voluptuousness, not\nas something in itself criminal, which has never been an Indian view, but as a\nhindrance in obtaining that serenity of mind without which the highest objects\nof life, dispassionateness, serenity, and clear-sightedness can never be\nobtained. A most useful edition of all the three _S_ atakas has lately been\npublished by Purohit Gopi Nath, M.A., Bombay, 1896.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that in Homer, in Shakespeare, nay, even in the\nBible, there are passages against which our modern taste revolts, yet we\nobject to Bowdlerised editions, because the indecencies are never of an\nintentional character, and would seem to have been so, if they were now\nremoved by us.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a's Wife](rls18.htm)\n\n"
