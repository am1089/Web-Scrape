I pray thee say,  \nAnd let this grace our deeds repay.'  \n   Danu had lent attentive ear  \nThe words which Rama spoke to hear,  \nAnd thus, a speaker skilled and tried.  \nTo that great orator replied:  \n' No heavenly lore my soul endows,  \nNaught know I of thy Maithil spouse.  \nYet will I, when my shape I wear.  \nHim who will tell thee all declare.  \nThen, Rama, will my lips disclose  \nHis name who well that giant knows  \nBut, till the flames my corse devour  \nThis hidden knowledge mocks my power.  \nFor through that curse's withering taint  \nMy knowledge now is small and faint  \nUnknown the giant's very name  \nWho bore away the Maithil dame  \nCursed for my evil deeds I wore  \nA shape which all the worlds abhor.  \nNow ere with wearied steeds the sun  \nThrough western skies his course have run,  \nDeep in a pit my body lay  \n\np. 314  \n\nAnd burn it in the wonted way.  \nWhen in the grave my corse is placed,  \nWith fire and funeral honours graced,  \nThen I, great chief, his name will tell  \nWho knows the giant robber well.  \nWith him, who guides his life aright,  \nIn league of trusting love unite,  \nAnd he, O valiant prince, will be  \nA faithful friend and aid to thee.  \nFor, Rama, to his searching eyes  \nThe triple world uncovered lies.  \nFor some dark cause of old, I ween,  \nThrough all the spheres his ways have been.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXIII.: Kabandha's Counsel.](ry271.htm)\n\n"
