The True cannot be known through the Untrue.\n\nWith reference to the assertion ([p. 24](sbe48007.htm#page_24) ff.) that\nPerception, which depends on the view of plurality, is based on some defect\nand hence admits of being otherwise accounted for--whence it follows that it\nis sublated by Scripture; we ask you to point out what defect it is on which\nPerception is based and may hence be accounted for otherwise.--' The\nbeginningless imagination of difference' we expect you to reply.--But, we ask\nin return, have you then come to know by some other means that this\nbeginningless imagination of difference, acting in a manner analogous to that\nof certain defects of vision, is really the cause of an altogether perverse\nview of things?--If you reply that this is known just from the fact that\nPerception is in conflict with Scripture, we point out that you are reasoning\nin a circle: you prove the defectiveness of the imagination of plurality\nthrough the fact that Scripture tells us about a substance devoid of all\ndifference; and at the same time you prove the latter point through the\nformer. Moreover, if Perception gives rise to perverse cognition because it is\nbased on the imagination of plurality, Scripture also is in no better case--\nfor it is based on the very same view.--If against this you urge that\nScripture, although based on a defect, yet sublates Perception in so far as it\nis the cause of a cognition which dispels all plurality apprehended through\nPerception, and thus is later in order than Perception; we rejoin that the\ndefectiveness of the foundation of Scripture having once been recognised, the\ncircumstance of its being later is of no avail. For if a man is afraid of a\nrope which he mistakes for a snake his fear does not come to an end because\nanother man, whom he considers to be in error himself, tells him 'This is no\nsnake, do not be afraid.' And that Scripture _is_ founded on something\ndefective is known at the very time of hearing Scripture, for the reflection\n(which follows on hearing) consists in repeated attempts to cognise the\noneness of Brahman--a cognition which is destructive of all the plurality\napprehended\n\np. 74\n\nthrough the first hearing of the Veda.--We further ask, 'By what means do you\narrive at the conclusion that Scripture cannot possibly be assumed to be\ndefective in any way, while defects may be ascribed to Perception'? It is\ncertainly not Consciousness--self-proved and absolutely devoid of all\ndifference--which enlightens you on this point; for such Consciousness is\nunrelated to any objects whatever, and incapable of partiality to Scripture.\nNor can sense-perception be the source of your conviction; for as it is\nfounded on what is defective it gives perverse information. Nor again the\nother sources of knowledge; for they are all based on sense-perception. As\nthus there are no acknowledged means of knowledge to prove your view, you must\ngive it up. But, you will perhaps say, we proceed by means of the ordinary\nempirical means and objects of knowledge!--What, we ask in reply, do you\nunderstand by 'empirical'?--What rests on immediate unreflective knowledge,\nbut is found not to hold good when tested by logical reasoning!--But what is\nthe use, we ask, of knowledge of this kind? If logical reasoning refutes\nsomething known through some means of knowledge, that means of knowledge is no\nlonger authoritative!--Now you will possibly argue as follows: 'Scripture as\nwell as Perception is founded on Nescience; but all the same Perception is\nsublated by Scripture. For as the object of Scripture, i.e. Brahman, which is\none and without a second, is not seen to be sublated by any ulterior\ncognition, Brahman, i.e. pure non-differenced Consciousness, remains as the\nsole Reality.'--But here too you are wrong, since we must decide that\nsomething which rests on a defect is unreal, although it may remain unrefuted.\nWe will illustrate this point by an analogous instance. Let us imagine a race\nof men afflicted with a certain special defect of vision, without being aware\nof this their defect, dwelling in some remote mountain caves inaccessible to\nall other men provided with sound eyes. As we assume all of these cave\ndwellers to be afflicted with the same defect of vision, they, all of them,\nwill equally see and judge bright things, e.g. the moon, to be double. Now in\nthe case of these people there never arises a subsequent cognition sublating\ntheir primitive\n\np. 75\n\ncognition; but the latter is false all the same, and its object, viz., the\ndoubleness of the moon, is false likewise; the defect of vision being the\ncause of a cognition not corresponding to reality.--And so it is with the\ncognition of Brahman also. This cognition is based on Nescience, and therefore\nis false, together with its object, viz. Brahman, although no sublating\ncognition presents itself.--This conclusion admits of various expressions in\nlogical form. 'The Brahman under dispute is false because it is the object of\nknowledge which has sprung from what is affected with Nescience; as the\nphenomenal world is.' 'Brahman is false because it is the object of knowledge;\nas the world is.' 'Brahman is false because it is the object of knowledge, the\nrise of which has the Untrue for its cause; as the world is.'\n\nYou will now perhaps set forth the following analogy. States of dreaming\nconsciousness--such as the perception of elephants and the like in one's\ndreams--are unreal, and yet they are the cause of the knowledge of real\nthings, viz. good or ill fortune (portended by those dreams). Hence there is\nno reason why Scripture--although unreal in so far as based on Nescience--\nshould not likewise be the cause of the cognition of what is real, viz.\nBrahman.--The two cases are not parallel, we reply. The conscious states\nexperienced in dreams are not unreal; it is only their objects that are false;\nthese objects only, not the conscious states, are sublated by the waking\nconsciousness. Nobody thinks 'the cognitions of which I was conscious in my\ndream are unreal'; what men actually think is 'the cognitions are real, but\nthe things are not real.' In the same way the illusive state of consciousness\nwhich the magician produces in the minds of other men by means of mantras,\ndrugs, &c., is true, and hence the cause of love and fear; for such states of\nconsciousness also are not sublated. The cognition which, owing to some defect\nin the object, the sense organ, &c., apprehends a rope as a snake is real, and\nhence the cause of fear and other emotions. True also is the imagination\nwhich, owing to the nearness of a snake, arises in the mind of a man though\nnot actually bitten, viz. that he has been bitten; true also is the\nrepresentation of the imagined\n\np. 76\n\npoison, for it may be the cause of actual death. In the same way the\nreflection of the face in the water is real, and hence enables us to ascertain\ndetails belonging to the real face. All these states of consciousness are\nreal, as we conclude from their having a beginning and actual effects.--Nor\nwould it avail you to object that in the absence of real elephants, and so on,\nthe ideas of them cannot be real. For ideas require only _some_ substrate in\ngeneral; the mere appearance of a thing is a sufficient substrate, and such an\nappearance is present in the case in question, owing to a certain defect. The\nthing we determine to be unreal because it is sublated; the idea is non-\nsublated, and therefore real.\n\nNor can you quote in favour of your view--of the real being known through the\nunreal--the instance of the stroke and the letter. The letter being\napprehended through the stroke (i.e. the written character) does not furnish a\ncase of the real being apprehended through the unreal; for the stroke itself\nis real.--But the stroke causes the idea of the letter only in so far as it is\napprehended as being a letter, and this 'being a letter' is untrue!--Not so,\nwe rejoin. If this 'being a letter' were unreal it could not be a means of the\napprehension of the letter; for we neither observe nor can prove that what is\nnon-existent and indefinable constitutes a means.--Let then the idea of the\nletter constitute the means!--In that case, we rejoin, the apprehension of the\nreal does not spring from the unreal; and besides, it would follow therefrom\nthat the means and what is to be effected thereby would be one, i.e. both\nwould be, without any distinction, the idea of the letter only. Moreover, if\nthe means were constituted by the stroke in so far as it is _not_ the letter,\nthe apprehension of all letters would result from the sight of one stroke; for\none stroke may easily be conceived as _not_ being _any_ letter.--But, in the\nsame way as the word 'Devadatta' conventionally denotes some particular man,\nso some particular stroke apprehended by the eye may conventionally symbolise\nsome particular letter to be apprehended by the ear, and thus a particular\nstroke may be the cause of the idea of a particular letter!--Quite so,\n\np. 77\n\nwe reply, but on this explanation the real is known through the real; for both\nstroke and conventional power of symbolisation are real. The case is analogous\nto that of the idea of a buffalo being caused by the picture of a buffalo;\nthat idea rests on the similarity of picture and thing depicted, and that\nsimilarity is something real. Nor can it be said (with a view to proving the\npurvapaksha by another analogous instance) that we meet with a cognition of\nthe real by means of the unreal in the case of sound ( _s_ abda) which is\nessentially uniform, but causes the apprehension of different things by means\nof difference of tone (nada). For sound is the cause of the apprehension of\ndifferent things in so far only as we apprehend the connexion of sound\nmanifesting itself in various tones, with the different things indicated by\nthose various tones 1. And, moreover, it is not correct to argue on the ground\nof the uniformity of sound; for only particular significant sounds such as\n'ga,' which can be apprehended by the ear, are really 'sound.'--All this\nproves that it is difficult indeed to show that the knowledge of a true thing,\nviz. Brahman, can be derived from Scripture, if Scripture--as based on\nNescience--is itself untrue.\n\nOur opponent may finally argue as follows:--Scripture is not unreal in the\nsame sense as a sky-flower is unreal; for antecedently to the cognition of\nuniversal non-duality Scripture is viewed as something that _is_ , and only on\nthe rise of that knowledge it is seen to be unreal. At this latter time\nScripture no longer is a means of cognising Brahman, devoid of all difference,\nconsisting of pure Intelligence; as long on the other hand as it is such a\nmeans, Scripture _is_ ; for then we judge 'Scripture is.'--But to this we\nreply that if Scripture is not (true), the judgment 'Scripture is' is false,\nand hence the knowledge resting on false Scripture being false likewise, the\nobject of that knowledge, i.e. Brahman itself, is false. If the cognition of\nfire which rests on mist being mistaken for smoke is false, it\n\np. 78\n\nfollows that the object of that cognition, viz. fire itself, is likewise\nunreal. Nor can it be shown that (in the case of Brahman) there is no\npossibility of ulterior sublative cognition; for there may be such sublative\ncognition, viz. the one expressed in the judgment 'the Reality is a Void.' And\nif you say that this latter judgment rests on error, we point out that\naccording to yourself the knowledge of Brahman is also based on error. And of\nour judgment (viz. 'the Reality is a Void') it may truly be said that all\nfurther negation is impossible.--But there is no need to continue this\ndemolition of an altogether baseless theory.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[77:1](sbe48025.htm#fr_13) And those manifestations of sound by means of\nvarious tones are themselves something real.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: No scriptural texts teach a Brahman devoid of all\ndifference](sbe48026.htm)\n\n"
