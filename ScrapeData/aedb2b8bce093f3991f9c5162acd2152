Their mutual love was so great that\nthey were more Like brothers than master and servant. Neither the Rajah nor\nthe Wuzeer had any children, and both were equally anxious to have a son. At\nlast, in one day and one hour~ the wile of the Rajah and the wife of the\nWuzeer had each a little baby boy. They named the Rajah's son Rama, and the\nson of the Wuzeer was called Luxman, and there were great rejoicings at the\nbirth of both. The boys grew up and loved each other tenderly; they were never\nhappy unless together; together they went to daily school, together bathed and\nplayed, and they would not eat except from off one piate. One day, when Rama\nRajah was fifteen years Did, his mother, the Ranee, said to Chandra Rajab,\n'Husband, our son associates too much with low people; for instance, he is\nalways at play with the Wuzeer's son, Luxman, which is not befitting his rank.\nI wish you would endeavour to put an end to their friendship, and find him\nbetter playmates.'\n\nChandra Rajah replied, 'I cannot do it; Luxman's father is ray very good\nfriend and Wuzeer, as his father's father was to my rather; let the sons be\nthe same.' This answer annoyed the Ranee, but she said no more to her husband;\nshe sent, however, for all the wise people and seers and conjurors in the\nland, and inquired of them whether there existed no means of dissolving the\nchildren's affection for each other; they answered they knew of none. At last\none old Nautch woman came to the Ranee and said, 'I can do this thing that you\nwish, but for it you must give me a great reward.' Then the Ranee gave the old\nwoman an enormous bag full of gold mohurs, and said, 'This I give you now, and\nif you succeed in the undertaking I will give you as much again.' So this\nwicked old woman disguised herself in a very rich dress, and went to a garden-\nhouse which Chandra Rajah had built for his son, and where Rama Rajah and\nLuxman, the young Wuzeer, used to spend the greater part of their playtime.\nOutside the house was a large well and a fine garden. When the old woman\narrived, the two boys were playing cards together in the garden close to the\nwell. She drew near, and began drawing water from it. Rama Rajah, looking up,\nsaw her, and said to Luxman, 'Go, see who that richly dressed woman is, and\nbring me word.' The Wuzeer's son did as he was bidden, and asked the woman\nwhat she wanted. She answered, 'Nothing, oh nothing,' and nodding her head\nwent away; then, returning to the Ranee, she said, 'I have done as you wished,\ngive me the promised reward,' and the Ranee gave her the second bag of gold.\nOn Luxman's return, the young Rajah said to him, 'What did the woman want?'\nLuxman answered, 'She told me she wanted nothing.' 'It is not true,' replied\nthe other angrily; 'I feel certain she must have told you something. Why\nshould she come here for no purpose? It is some secret which you are\nconcealing from me; I insist on knowing it.' Luxman vainly protesting the\ncontrary, they quarrelled and then fought, and the young Rajah ran home very\nangry to his father. 'What is the matter, my son?' said he. 'Father,' he\nanswered, 'I am angry with the Wuzeer's son. I hate that boy; kill him, and\nlet his eyes be brought to me in proof of his death, or I will not eat my\ndinner.' Chandra Rajah was very much grieved at this, but the young Rajah\nwould eat no dinner, and at last his father said to the Wuzeer, 'Take your son\naway, and hide him, for the boys have had a quarrel.' Then he went out and\nshot a deer, and showing its eyes to Rama, said to him, 'See, my son, the good\nWuzeer's son has by your order been deprived of life;' and Rama Rajah was\nmerry, and ate his dinner. But a while after he began to miss his kind\nplaymate; there was nobody he cared for to tell him stories and amuse him.\nThen for four nights running he dreamed of a beautiful Glass Palace, in which\ndwelt a Princess white as marble, and he sent for all the wise people in the\nkingdom to interpret his dream, but none could do it; and, thinking upon this\nfair Princess and his lost friend, he got more and more sad, and said to\nhimself, 'There is nobody to help me in this matter. Ah! if my Wuzeer's son\nwere here now, how quickly would he interpret the dream! O my friend, my\nfriend, my dear lost friend!' and when Chandra Rajah, his father, came in, he\nsaid to him, 'Show me the grave of Luxman, son of the Wuzeer, that I also may\ndie there.' His father replied, 'What a foolish boy you are! You first begged\nthat the Wuzeer's son might be killed, and now you want to die on his grave.\nWhat is all this about? Rama Rajah replied, 'Oh! why did you give the order\nfor him to be put to death? In him I have lost my friend and all my joy in\nlife; show me now his grave, for thereon, I swear, will I kill myself.' When\nthe Rajah saw that his son really grieved for the loss of Luxman, he said to\nhim, 'You have to thank me for disregarding your foolish wishes; your old\nplaymate is living, therefore be friends again, for what you thought were his\neyes were but the eyes of a deer.' So the friendship of Rama and Luxman was\nresumed on its former footing. Then Rama said to Luxman, 'Four nights ago I\ndreamed a strange dream. I thought that for miles and miles I wandered through\na dense jungle, after which I came upon a grove of Cocoa. nut trees, passing\nthrough which I reached one composed entirely of Guava trees, then one of\nSupari  2 trees, and lastly one of Copal trees. Beyond this lay a garden of\nflowers, of which the Malee's wife gave me a bunch; round the garden ran a\nlarge river, and on the other side of this I saw a fair palace composed of\ntransparent glass, and in the centre of it sat the most lovely Princess I ever\nsaw, white as marble, and covered with rich jewels; at the sight of her beauty\nI fainted--and so awoke. This has happened now four times, and as yet I have\nfound no one capable of throwing any light on the vision.' Luxman answered, 'I\ncan tell you. There exists a Princess exactly like her you saw in your dreams,\nand, if you like, you can go and marry her.' 'How can I?' said Rama; 'and what\nis your interpretation of the dream?' The Wuzeer's son replied, 'Listen to me,\nand I will tell you. In a country very far away from this, in the centre of a\ngreat Rajah's kingdom, there dwells his daughter, a most fair Princess; she\nlives in a glass palace. Round this palace runs a large river, and round the\nriver is a garden of flowers. Round the garden are four thick groves of trees,\none of Copal trees, one of Supari trees, one of Guava trees, and one of Cocoa-\nnut trees. The Princess is twenty-four years old, but she is not married, for\nshe has determined only to marry whoever can jump this river and greet her in\nher crystal palace, and though many thousand kings have essayed to do so, they\nhave all perished miserably in the attempt, having either been drowned in the\nriver, or broken their necks by falling; thus all that you dreamed of is\nperfectly true.' 'Can we go to this country?' asked the young Rajah. 'Oh yes,'\nhis friend replied; 'this is what you must do. Go tell your father you wish to\nsee the world. Ask him for neither elephants nor attendants, but beg him to\nlend you for the journey his old war-horse.'\n\nUpon this Rama went to his father, and said, 'Father, I pray you give me leave\nto go and travel with the Wuzeer's son; I desire to see the world.' 'What\nwould you have for the journey, my son?' said Chandra Rajah; 'will you have\nelephants, and how many?--attendants, how many?' 'Neither, father,' he\nanswered; 'give me rather, I pray you, your old war-horse, that I may ride him\nduring the journey.' 'So be it, my son,' he answered; and with that Rama Rajah\nand Luxman set forth on their travels. After going many, many thousands of\nmiles, to their joy one day they came upon a dense grove of Cocoa-nut trees,\nand beyond that to a grove of Guava trees, then to one of Supari trees, and\nlastly to one of Copal trees; after which they entered a beautiful garden,\nwhere the Malee's wife presented them with a large bunch of flowers. Then they\nknew that they had nearly reached the place where the fair Princess dwelt. Now\nit happened that, because many kings and great people had been drowned in\ntrying to jump over the river that ran round the Glass Palace where the\nPrincess lived, the Rajah, her father, had made a law that, in future, no\naspirants to her hand were to attempt the jump, except at stated times, and\nwith his knowledge and permission, and that any Rajahs or Princes found\nwandering there, contrary to this law, were to be imprisoned. Of this the\nyoung Rajah and the Wuzeer's son knew nothing, and having reached the centre\nof the garden they found themselves on the banks of a large river, exactly\nopposite the wondrous Glass Palace, and were just debating what further steps\nto take when they were seized by the Rajah's guard, and hurried off to prison.\n\n'This is a hard fate,' said Luxman. 'Yes,' sighed Rama Rajah, 'a dismal end,\nin truth, to all our fine schemes. Would it be possible, think you, to\nescape?' 'I think so,' answered Luxman, 'at all events I will try.' With that\nhe turned to the sentry who M as guarding them, and said, 'We are shut in here\nand can't get out; here is money for you if you will only have the goodness to\ncall out that the Malee's cow has strayed away.' The sentry thought this a\nvery easy way of making a fortune, so he did as he was bidden, and took the\nmoney. The result answered Luxman's anticipations. The Malee's wife hearing\nthe sentry calling out, thought to herself, 'What, sentries round the guard-\nroom again! then there must be prisoners: doubtless they are those two young\nRajah's I met in the garden this morning; I will at least endeavour to release\nthem.' So she asked two old beggars to accompany her, and, taking with her\nofferings of flowers and sweetmeats, started as if to go to a little temple\nwhich was built within the quadrangle where the prisoners were kept. The\nsentries, thinking she was only going with two old friends to visit the\ntemple, allowed her to pass without opposition. As soon as she got within the\nquadrangle she unfastened the prison-door, and told the two young men (Rama\nRajah and Luxman) to change clothes with the two old beggars, which they\ninstantly did. Then leaving the beggars in the cell, she conducted Rama and\nLuxman safely to her house. When they had reached it she said to them, 'Young\nPnnces, you must know that you did very wrong in going down to the river\nbefore having made a salaam to our Rajah, and gained his consent; and so\nstrict is the law on this subject that had I not assisted your escape, you\nmight have remained a long time in prison; though, as I felt certain you only\nerred through ignorance, I was the more willing to help you; but to-morrow\nmorning early you must go and pay your respects at Court.'\n\nNext day the guards brought their two prisoners to the Rajah, saying, 'See, O\nKing, here are two young Rajahs whom we caught last night wandering near the\nriver contrary to your law and commandment.' But when they came to look at the\nprisoners, lo and behold! they were only two old beggars whom everybody knew\nand had often seen at the palace gate.\n\nThen the Rajah laughed and said, 'You stupid fellows, you have been over\nvigilant for once; see here your fine young Rajahs. Don't you yet know the\nlooks of these old beggars?' Whereupon the guards went away much ashamed of\nthemselves.\n\nHaving learnt discretion from the advice of the Malee's wife, Rama and Luxman\nwent betimes that morning to call at the Rajah's palace. The Rajah received\nthem very graciously, but when he heard the object of their journey he shook\nhis head, and said, 'My pretty fellows, far be it from me to thwart your\nintentions, if you are really determined to win my daughter the Princess\nBargaruttee,  3\\--but as a friend I would counsel you to desist from the\nattempt,--you can find a hundred Princesses elsewhere willing to marry you;\nwhy, therefore, come here, where already a thousand Princes as fair as you\nhave lost their lives? Cease to think of my daughter, she is a headstrong\ngirl.' But Rama Rajah still declared himself anxious to try and jump the\ndangerous river, whereupon the Rajah unwillingly consented to his attempting\nto do so, and caused it to be solemnly proclaimed round the town that another\nPrince was going to risk his life, begging all good men and true to pray for\nhis success. Then Rama having dressed gorgeously, and mounted his father's\nstout war-horse, put spurs to it and galloped to the river. Up, up in the air,\nlike a bird, jumped the good war-horse, right across the river and into the\nvery centre courtyard of the Glass Palace of the Princess Bargaruttee: and as\nif ashamed of so poor an exploit, this feat he accomplished three times. At\nthis the heart of the Rajah was glad, and he ran and patted the brave horse,\nand kissed Rama Rajah, and said, 'Welcome, my son-in-law!' The wedding took\nplace amid great rejoicings, with feasts, illuminations, and much giving of\npresents, and there Rama Rajah and his wife, the Ranee Bargaruttee, lived\nhappily for some time. At last, one day, Rama Rajah said to his father-in-law,\n'Sire, I have been very happy here, but I have a great desire to see my\nfather, and my mother, and my own land again.' To which the Rajah replied, 'My\nson, you are free to go; but I have no son but you, nor daughter but your\nwife: therefore as it grieves me to lose sight of you, come back now and then\nto see me and rejoice my heart. My doors are ever open to you; you will be\nalways welcome.'\n\nRama Rajah promised to return occasionally; and then, being given many rich\ngifts by the old Rajah, and supplied with all things needful for the journey,\nhe, with his beautiful wife Bargaruttee, his friend the young Wuzeer, and a\ngreat retinue, set out to return home.\n\nBefore going Rama Rajah and Luxman richly rewarded the kind Malee's wife, who\nhad helped them so ably.\n\nOn the first evening of their march the travellers reached the borders of the\nCocoa-nut grove, on the outskirts of the jungle; here they determined to halt\nand rest for the night. Rama Rajah and the Ranee Bargaruttee went to their\ntent; but Luxman (whose tender love for them was so great, that he usually\nwatched all night through at their door) was sitting under a large tree close\nby, when two little owls flew over his head, and perching on one of the\nhighest branches, began chatting to each other.  4 The Wuzeer's son, who was\nin many ways wiser than most men, could understand their language. To his\nsurprise he heard the little lady owl say to her husband, 'I wish you would\ntell me a story, my dear, it is such a long time since I have heard one.' To\nwhich her husband, the other little owl, answered, 'A story! what story can I\ntell you? Do you see these people encamped under our tree? Would you like to\n)iear their story?' She assented; and he began, 'See first this poor Wuzeer,\nhe is a good and faithful man, and has done much for this young Rajah, but\nneither has that been to his advantage heretofore, nor will it be hereafter.'\nAt this Luxman listened more attentively, and taking out his writing tablets,\ndetermined to note down all he heard. The little owl commenced with the story\nof the birth of Rama and Luxman, of their friendship, their quarrel, the young\nRajah's dream, and their reconciliation, and then told of their subsequent\nadventures in search of the Princess Bargaruttee, down to that very day on\nwhich they were journeying home. 'And what more has Fate in store for this\npoor Wuzeer?' asked the lady owl. 'From this place,' replied her husband, 'he\nwill journey on with the young Rajah and Ranee, until they get very near\nChandra Rajah's dominions; there, as the whole cavalcade is about to pass\nunder a large banyan tree, this Wuzeer Luxman will notice some of the topmost\nbranches swaying about j~ a dangerous manner; he will hurry the Rajah and\nRanee away from it, and the tree (which would otherwise have inevitably killed\nthem) will fall to the ground with a tremendous crash; but even his having\nthus saved the Rajah's life shall not avert his fate.' (All this the Wuzeer\nnoted down.) 'And what next?' said the wife, 'what next?' 'Next,' continued\nthe wise little story-teller, 'next, just as the Rajah Rama and the Ranee\nBargaruttee and all their suite are passing under the palace doorway, the\nWuzeer will notice that the arch is insecure, and by dragging them quickly\nthrough prevent their being crushed in its fall' 'And what will he do after\nthat, dear husband?' she asked. 'After that,' he went on, 'when the Rajah and\nRanee are asleep, and the Wuzeer Luxman keeping guard over them, he will\nperceive a large cobra slowly crawling down the wall and drawing nearer and\nnearer to the Ranee. He will kill it with his sword, but a drop of the cobra's\nblood shall fall on the Ranee's white forehead. The Wuzeer will not dare to\nwipe the blood off her forehead with his hand, and shall instead cover his\nface With a cloth that he may lick it off with his tongue, but for this the\nRajah will be angry with him, and his reproaches will turn this poor Wuzeer\ninto stone.'\n\n'Will he always remain stone?' asked the lady owl. 'Not for ever,' answered\nher husband, 'but for eight long years he will remain so.' 'And what then?'\ndemanded she. 'Then,' answered the other, 'when the young Rajah and Ranee have\na baby, it shall come to pass that one day the child shall be playing on the\nfloor, and to help itself along shall clasp hold of the stony figure, and at\nthat baby's touch the Wuzeer will come to life again. But I have told you\nenough for one night; come, let 's catch mice,--tuwhit, tuwhoo, tuwhoo,' and\naway flew the owls. Luxman had written down all he heard, and it made him\nheavy-hearted, but he thought, 'Perhaps, after all, this may not be true.' So\nhe said nothing about it to any living soul. Next day they continued their\njourney, and as the owl had prophesied, so events fell out. For whilst the\nwhole party were passing under a large banyan tree, the Wuzeer noticed that it\nlooked unsafe. 'The owl spake truly,' he thought to himself, and seizing the\nRajah and Ranee he hurried them from under it, just as a huge limb of the tree\nfell prone with a fearful crash.\n\nA little while after, having reached Chandra Rajah's dominions, they were\ngoing under the great arch of the palace court-yard when the Wuzeer noticed\nsome of the stones tottering. 'The owl was a true prophet,' thought he again,\nand catching hold of the hands of Rama Rajah and Bargaruttee Ranee, he pulled\nthem rapidly through, just in time to save their lives. 'Pardon me,' he said\nto the Rajah, 'that unbidden I dared thus to touch your hand and that of the\nRanee, but I saw the danger imminent.' So they reached home, where they were\njoyfully welcomed by Chandra Rajah, the Ranee, the Wuzeer (Luxman's father),\nand all the Court.\n\nA few nights afterwards, when the Rajah and Ranee were asleep, and the young\nWuzeer keeping guard over them as he was wont, he saw a large black cobra\nstealthily creeping down the wall just above the Ranee's head. 'Alas!' he\nthought, 'then such is my fate, and so it must be; nevertheless, I will do my\nduty;' and, taking from the folds of his dress the history of his and the\nyoung Rajah's life, from their boyhood down to that very time (as he had\nwritten it from the owl's narrative), he laid it beside the sleeping Rama,\nand, drawing his sword, killed the cobra. A few drops of the serpent's blood\nfell on the Ranee's forehead--the Wuzeer did not dare to touch it with his\nhand, but, that her sacred brow might not be defiled with the vile cobra's\nblood, he reverently covered his face and mouth with a cloth to lick the drops\nof blood away. At this moment the Rajah started up, and seeing him, said, 'O\nWuzeer, Wuzeer, is this well done of you? O Luxman, who have been to me as a\nbrother, who have saved me from so many difficulties, why do you treat me\nthus? to kiss her holy forehead. If indeed you loved her (as who could help\nit?), could you not have told me when we first saw her in that Glass Palace,\nand I would have exiled myself that she might be your wife. O my brother, my\nbrother, why did you mock me thus?' The Rajah had buried his face in his\nhands; he looked up, he turned to the Wuzeer, but from him came neither answer\nnor reply. He had become a senseless stone. Then Rama for the first time\nperceived the roll of paper which Luxman had laid beside him, and when he read\nin it of what Luxman had been to him from boyhood, and of the end, his bitter\ngrief broke through all bounds, and falling at the feet of the statue, he\nclasped its stony knees and wept aloud. When daylight dawned Chandra Rajah and\nthe Ranee found Rama still weeping and hugging the stone, asking its\nforgiveness with penitent cries and tears. Then they said to him, 'What is\nthis you have done?' When he told them, the Rajah his father was very angry,\nand said, 'Was it not enough that you should have once before unjustly desired\nthe death of this good man, but that now by your rash reproaches you should\nhave turned him into stone? Go to, you do but continually what is evil.'\n\nNow eight long years rolled by without the Wuzeer returning to his original\nform, although every day Rama Rajah and Bargaruttee Ranee would watch beside\nhim, kissing his cold hands, and adjuring him by all endearing names to\nforgive them and return to them again. When eight years had expired, Rama and\nBargaruttee had a child; and from the time it was nine months old and first\nbegan to try and crawl about, the father and mother would sit and watch beside\nit, placing it near the Wuzeer's statue, in hopes that the baby would some day\ntouch it as the owl had foretold.\n\nBut for three months they watched in vain. At last, one day when the child was\na year old, and was trying to walk, it chanced to be close to the statue, and\ntottering on its unsteady feet, stretched out its tiny hands and caught hold\nof the foot of the stone. The Wuzeer instantly came back to life, and stooping\ndown seized in his arms the little baby who had rescued him, and kissed it. It\nis impossible to describe the delight of Rama Rajah and his wife at regaining\ntheir long-lost friend. The old Rajab and Ranee rejoiced also, with the Wuzeer\n(Luxman Wuzeer's father), and his mother.\n\nThen Chandra Rajah said to the Wuzeer, 'Here is my boy happy with his wife and\nchild, while your son has neither; go fetch him a wife, and we will have a\nright merry wedding.' So the Wuzeer fetched for his son a kind and beautiful\nwife, and Chandra Rajah and Rama Rajah caused the wedding of Luxman to be\ngrander than that of any great Rajah before or since, even as if he had been a\nson of the royal house, and they all lived very happy ever after, as all good\nfathers, and mothers, and husbands, and wives, and children do.\n\n![](img/14.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd09.htm#fr_36) Moon-King.\n\n[2](odd09.htm#fr_37) Areca Catechu, the Betel-Nut Palm.\n\n[3](odd09.htm#fr_38) A name of the Ganges.\n\n[4](odd09.htm#fr_39) See Notes at the end.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI.
