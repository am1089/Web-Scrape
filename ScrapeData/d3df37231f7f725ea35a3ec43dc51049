Prayer to lightning, conceived as the cause of fever, headache, and\ncough.\n\n1\\. The first red bull, born of the (cloud-)womb, born of wind and clouds,\ncomes on thundering with rain. May he, that cleaving moves straight on, spare\nour bodies; he who, a single force, has passed through threefold!  \n2\\. Bowing down to thee that fastenest thyself with heat upon every limb, we\nwould reverence thee with oblations; we would reverence with oblations the\ncrooks and hooks of thee that hast, as a seizer, seized the limbs of this\nperson.  \n3\\. Free him from headache and also from cough, (produced by the lightning)\nthat has entered his every joint! May the flashing (lightning), that is born\nof the cloud, and born of the wind, strike the trees and the mountains!  \n4\\. Comfort be to my upper limb, comfort be to my nether; comfort be to my\nfour members, comfort to my entire body!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 22. Charm against jaundice and related diseases](av009.htm)\n\n'
