It leads to the same destination as all the other\nbranches of Yoga, but is especially suited for such as are emotional in their\nnature and have the feeling of love and devotion highly developed. It is for\nthose devotees who, conscious of their own weakness arising from lack of self-\ncontrol and of knowledge, seek help from outside; and who, taking refuge in\nthe Supreme, pray to Him for forgiveness and for pardon of sins committed\nthrough ignorance of the moral and spiritual laws that govern our lives.\n\np. 95\n\n[paragraph continues] All dualistic systems of religion, like Christianity,\nJudaism, and Mahometanism, which advocate the worship of a personal God,\nknowingly or unknowingly preach Bhakti Yoga and direct their adherents along\nthis path.\n\nThe word "Bhakti" means devotion, while Yoga in this case signifies union of\nthe individual soul with God. Hence Bhakti Yoga is the method of devotion by\nwhich true communion of the soul with the Supreme Deity is accomplished. It\nshows what kind of devotion and love for God will bring the soul into the most\nintimate relation with the Divine Being; and how even the ordinary feelings of\na human heart, when directed Godward, can become the means of attaining\nspiritual oneness with the Soul of the universe. Raja Yoga tells us that\ndesire, passion, love, hatred, pride, anger, must be completely conquered\n\np. 96\n\nbefore perfection can be reached. A student of Raja Yoga must not only keep\nconstant watch over his mind, but he must also faithfully practice the eight\nsteps already described, if he would achieve his highest ideal; while in\nBhakti Yoga we learn that all desires and passions, whether good or bad, can\nbe directed towards God. Then, instead of binding the soul to worldliness and\nearthly attachment, they become a means of attaining God-consciousness and\nabsolute freedom from selfishness and wickedness.\n\nA follower of Bhakti Yoga should feel God as closely related to his soul as he\npossibly can; and regard Him not only as the Lord of the universe, but as\nfather, mother, brother, sister, friend, or child. Even the relation existing\nbetween husband and wife may be cultivated and developed in the heart of a\nlover of\n\np. 97\n\n[paragraph continues] God, intoxicated by the soul-stirring wine of Divine\nLove. When the whole heart and soul of a Bhakta or lover of God flow like the\nunbroken current of a mighty river, surmounting all barriers and dashing\nheadlong toward the ocean of Divinity, he finds no other attraction in the\nworld, holds no other thought, cherishes no other desire, speaks no other\nword, and sees no other thing than his most Beloved, the Omnipresent Deity. He\nresigns himself entirely to Him and surrenders his will to the will of the\nAlmighty One. He works, but without thinking of results. Every action of his\nbody and mind is performed simply to please his Beloved One. His motive power\nis love alone and by this he breaks asunder the chain of selfishness,\ntranscends the law of Karma, and becomes free. Thus a true Bhakti Yogi, being\nconstantly in tune with the Infinite, loses the\n\np. 98\n\nsense of "I," "Me," and "Mine," and makes room for "Thou," "Thee," and\n"Thine."\n\nA Bhakta never forgets his relation to his Beloved. His mind is concentrated\nand one-pointed; consequently meditation becomes easy for him. True devotion\nor continuous remembrance of the Divine Ideal leads to unceasing meditation,\nand ultimately lifts the soul into Samadhi, where it realizes God and communes\nwith Him undisturbed by any other thought, feeling, idea, or sensation.\nBecoming dead to sense phenomena, it lives on the spiritual plane of God-\nconsciousness. Wherever such a Yogi casts his eyes, he sees the presence of\nthe All-pervading Divinity and enjoys unbounded peace and happiness at every\nmoment of his life. It is for this reason that Bhakti Yoga is considered to be\nthe easiest of all\n\np. 99\n\nmethods. What a Raja Yogi attains only after years of practice, a Bhakta\naccomplishes in a short time through extreme devotion and love. That which a\nKarma Yogi finds so difficult to achieve, a Bhakti Yogi attains easily by\noffering the fruits of all his works to the Almighty Source of all activity\nand the ultimate end of all motives.\n\nBhakti Yoga has two grades,--the first is called "Gauni," or preparatory and\nincludes all the preliminary practices; the second is "Para," or the state of\nsupreme love and devotion to God. A beginner in Bhakti Yoga should first of\nall prepare the ground of his heart by freeing it from attachment to earthly\nobjects and sense-pleasures; then by arousing in it extreme longing to see\nGod, to realize Divinity, to go to the Source of all knowledge, and to reach\nperfection and God-consciousness in this life. He must be absolutely earnest\n\np. 100\n\nand sincere. He should seek the company of a true lover of God, whose life is\npure and spotless, who has renounced all worldly connections, and who has\nrealized the true relation which the individual soul bears to the Universal\nSpirit. If, by good fortune, he meets such a real Bhakta, he should receive\nfrom him the seed of Bhakti, plant it in the ground of his heart, and by\nfaithfully following the instructions of the master, take special care to keep\nit alive and make it grow, until it becomes a large tree bearing the fruit of\nDivine Love. He should have respect, reverence, and love for his master, who\nwill open his spiritual eye and transmit his own spiritual powers to his soul.\nWhen these powers begin to work, the soul will be awakened from the deep sleep\nof ignorance and self-delusion.\n\nThe Guru, or spiritual eye-opener, knowing\n\np. 101\n\nthe natural tendency of the disciple, will advise him to look upon God as his\nMaster, or as his Father or Mother, and will thus establish a definite\nrelation between his soul and God. Henceforth the disciple should learn to\nworship or pray to the Supreme through this particular relation. At this stage\nsymbols, rituals, ceremonies may appeal to his mind; or he may repeat some\nname of the Lord that signifies the special aspect of the Divinity\ncorresponding to the relation which he bears to Him. Constant repetition of\nsuch a name will help the mind of the neophyte to become concentrated upon the\nDivine Being. During this period he should avoid such company, such places,\nand such amusements as make him forget his chosen Ideal. He should live a\nchaste and pure life, always discriminating right from wrong and struggling to\ncontrol his passions\n\np. 102\n\nand desires by directing them Godward. He should be angry with himself for not\nrealizing his ideal; he should hate his sinful nature because it keeps him\naway from the path of Bhakti and prevents him from remembering his Beloved.\nThus he will gradually succeed in correcting his faults and in gaining control\nover his animal nature.\n\nA traveller on the path of Bhakti should observe cleanliness of body and mind,\nshould be truthful, and lead a simple life, without injuring any living\ncreature mentally or physically. He should not kill any animal for his food,\nneither should he covet that which does not belong to him. He should,\nfurthermore, obey the laws of health which tend to make him physically strong,\nas well as those moral laws the violation of which weakens the mind.\n\nSo long as the devotee thinks of God\n\np. 103\n\nwith a form and believes that He is outside of his soul and of the universe,\nhe can make a mental picture of Him and worship the Divine Ideal through that\nform; or he may keep before him some symbolic figure like the cross which will\nremind him of his Ideal at the time of devotion. But a Bhakta should never\nmistake the imaginary form or the symbolic figure for the real Ideal. Wherever\nthere is such a mistake there is to be found spiritual degeneration and the\nexpression of ignorance in the form of sectarianism, bigotry, fanaticism.\n\nGradually, as the Bhakta approaches God, he will rise above such dualistic\nconceptions and realize that his Beloved is not only transcendent but immanent\nin nature, that nature is His body, that He dwells everywhere, that He is the\nSoul of our souls and the Life of our life, that He is the one stupendous\nWhole while we are but\n\np. 104\n\n[paragraph continues] His parts. The Bhakta then reaches that state which is\ncalled qualified non-dualism. He sees that from the minutest insect up to man\nall living creatures are related to the Iswara 1 s a part is related to the\nwhole. Therefore he cannot kill or injure any living being. Understanding that\neverything pertaining to any part belongs in reality to the whole, he says,\n"Whatever is mine is Thine"; and it is from this moment that absolute self-\nresignation and self-surrender to the will of the Iswara begin to reign\nsupreme in the soul of the Yogi. Then he is able to say from the bottom of his\nheart, "Let Thy will be done," and never again can he forget that his soul is\na part of the Iswara. His devotion henceforth consists in remembering this new\nrelation, and his\n\np. 105\n\nworship takes a new form. Whatever he does with mind or body becomes an act of\nworship of the Supreme Whole, for he realizes that he possesses no power that\ndoes not belong to God. Eating, drinking, walking, talking, and every other\nwork of his daily life become acts of devotion, and the entire existence of\nsuch a Bhakta is a continuous series of acts of worship. Then the heart is\npurified and selfishness is dead.\n\nThe devotee thus rises to the second grade of Bhakti Yoga and begins to taste\nthat Divine Love which is the fruit of the tree of Bhakti. Here all\ndistinction between lover and Beloved disappears; the lover, the Beloved and\nLove all merge into one ocean of Divinity. The soul of the Bhakta is\ntransformed, and manifesting omniscience, God-consciousness, perfect freedom,\nand all other Divine qualities, it attains to the highest ideal of Bhakti\nYoga.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[104:1](hby08.htm#fr_5) The most appropriate Sanskrit word for God who is the\nall-pervading, internal Ruler of the universe.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Jnana Yoga](hby09.htm)\n\n'
