Suta said :-- O Mahar _s_ is! The son of the above mentioned Budha is\nthe greatly religious Pururava, of a very charitable disposition, and always\nready to perform sacrificial acts; he was born of a kshattriya woman named\nIla; and I will now describe how this Pururava was born of Ila and Budha,\nkindly listen.\n\n\n\nIn days of yore there was a king named Sudyumna, very truthful and highly\ncapable in keeping his senses under control. Once on a time, wearing beautiful\near-rings, with extraordinary bow named \xc3\x82jagab and holding the arrow-case full\nof arrows on his back, he went out on hunt to a forest, riding on a horse,\nborn of the country Sindhu, surrounded by a few of his ministers. Going about\nin the regions of forest, the king got for his shikar, buck, hare, boar,\nrhinoceros, bison, buffalo, young elephant, Srimar deer, wild fowl and various\nother animals fit for sacrificial purposes; thus he went on deep into the\ninterior of the forest. This divine forest was adorned with rows of Mandara\ntrees and situated at the bottom of the mount Sumeru. Various trees and\nflowers were spreading the beauty of the forest all around; at places were\nAsoka creepers, Vakula, Sal, Tal, Tamal, Champak, Panasa, mangoe, Nip,\nMadhuka, pomegranate, cocoanut, Yuthika, plantain, kunda creeper, and various\nother trees and flowers; at some other places the bowers formed of Madhavi\ncreepers enhanced the beauty and shed the lustre all around. There were tanks\nand reservoirs of water in the forest filled with swans, kara _nd_ avas, and\nother aquatic birds. The bamboo trees on their banks becoming filled with air\nwere emitting sweet musical sounds; and at many places of that all blissgiving\nforest, there were bees humming sweetly and delighting the minds of people\nthere. Now the Rajar _s_ i Pradyumna became highly gladdened in his heart to\nsee this interior of the forest, resonated with the cooing of the cuckoos and\nbeautified by various lovely flowers; and no sooner he entered there than he\nwas turned into a female and his horse, also, turned\n\n\n\np. 42\n\n\n\ninto a mare; the king, then, became seriously anxious. He began to think over\nand over again \xc2\x93What is this? How has this come to pass?\xc2\x94 and became very\nashamed and sorry and pondered over thus :--\xc2\x93What am I to do now? How can I in\nthis woman condition go back to my house and how shall I govern my kingdom?\nAlas! Who has deceived me thus!\xc2\x94 Hearing these astounding words of Suta, the\nRi _s_ is said :-- \xc2\x93O Suta! You have mentioned that the king Sudyumna equal to\ngod has been turned into a woman; this is very strange indeed! Therefore, O\nSuvrata! What is the reason of his being turned into a mare? Kindly describe\nfully what that beautiful king did in the forest?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nSuta, said :-- Once on a time, Sanaka and other Ri _s_ is went to this forest\nto pay a visit to S'ankara, illuminating the ten quarters by their holy aura.\nBut then Bhagavan S'ankara was in amorous dealings with S'ankari. The\nbeautiful Devi Ambika was then naked and sitting on the lap of S'ankara and\ntherefore became very much ashamed at their sight; She got up hurriedly, and\nputting on her cloth, remained there shuddering, with great shame and\nsensitiveness. The Ri _s_ is, also, seeing them engaged in amorous dealings,\nwent away quickly to the hermitage of Nara Naraya _n_ a.\n\n\n\nThen Bhagavan S'ankara, seeing S'ankari too much sensitive, said :-- \xc2\x93Why are\nyou so much bashful and shy? I am doing just now what will give you pleasure.\nO Beautiful one! Whoever male will enter from to-day and hereafter, within the\nprecincts of this forest, will be instantly converted into a woman.\xc2\x94 O Munis!\nThough the forest gave all delights to all, yet, having this defect, all the\npersons that know of this curse, carefully avoid the forest. No sooner did the\nKing Sudyumna enter into the forest, out of ignorance, than he, as well as his\nattendants, were instantly turned into women; there could be no doubt in this.\nThe king became overpowered with great care and anxiety and did not go back,\nout of shame, to his palace; but he began to wander to and fro on the outer\nskirts of that forest. He became known afterwards as the woman Ila. Now, once\non an occasion, Budh, while he was wandering at his will, came up there and\nseeing the beautiful Ila with gestures and pastures and surrounded by women,\nbecame passionately attached towards her; and Ila, too, seeing the beautiful\nBudh, the son of Chandra deva, became desirous to have him as her husband.\nThey became so very much tied in love towards each other, that intercourse\ntook place there. Thus Bhagavan Budh generated, in the womb of Ila, Pururava;\nand Ila gave birth, in due time, the son Pururava in that forest. She then,\nwith an anxious heart, recollected, while in the forest, her (rather his),\nfamily priest Va _s_ i _st_ ha Deva. Now then Va _s_ i _st_ ha Deva, seeing\nthe distressed condition of the king Sudyumna\n\n\n\np. 43\n\n\n\nbecame affected with pity and pleased Mahadeva, S\xc2\x92ankara, the most auspicious\nDeva of all, by hymns and praises. When Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ankara wanted to grant him\nthe boon that he desired, Va _s_ i _st_ ha Deva wanted that the king would be\nturned again into man as before. At this Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ankara said, in\nrecognition of His promise, that the king Sudyumna would be alternately one\nmonth a man and the second month a woman and so on. Thus, by the favour of Va\n_s_ i _st_ ha Deva, the king Sudyumna got this boon and returned to his\nkingdom and began to govern it. When he used to be turned into a woman, he\nused to remain in the interior, and when he used to become a man, he governed\nhis kingdom. At this the subjects became very anxious and did not welcome the\nking as they used to do before. Some days passed away in this way when the\nprince Pururava grew up into manhood. Then the king Sudyumna gave over to him\nthe kingdom and made him the king of the new capital named Prati _st_ han; and\nstarted out to an hermitage to perform tapasya. He went to a beautiful forest,\nvariegated with all sorts of trees, and got from the Devar _s_ i Narada the\nexcellent mantra of the Bhagavati Devi, consisting of nine letters. He began\nto repeat it incessantly, with an heart filled with love. Thus some days\npassed away when the all-auspicious Devi Bhagavati, the Saviour of the whole\nUniverse, became pleased with the king and appeared before the king, assuming\nthe divine beautiful form, composed of attributes, intoxicated with the drink,\nand with eyes rolling with pride, and riding on vahana, the lion. Seeing this\ndivine form of the Mother of the Universe, the king Ila (in this form) bowed\ndown before Her with eyes filled with love and gladly praised Her with hymns\nthus :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavati! What a fortunate being I am! That I have seen today the\nextraordinary world renowned benignant form of Thine granting grace and\nbenefit to all the Lokas, I, therefore, bow down to Thy lotus-feet, granting\ndesires and liberation, and served by the whole host of the Devas. O Mother!\nWhat mortal is there on this earth, who can fully comprehend Thy glories when\nall the Devas and Munis get bewildered in trying to know of them.\n\n\n\nO Devi! I am thoroughly astonished to see Thy glories and Thy compassion\ntowards the distressed and poor and helpless people. How can a human being,\nwho is devoid of attributes comprehend Thy attributes when Brahma, Vi _sn_ u,\nMahes'vara, Indra, Chandra (moon), Pavana (wind), Surya, Kuvera, and the eight\nVasus know not Thy powers. O Mother! Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, of unrivalled\nbrilliancy, knows Thee as a part of Thine only, as Kamala of Sattva Gu _n_ as\nand giving one all one's desires; Bhagavan Brahma knows Thy part only as the\nform made of Rajo gu _n_ a and\n\n\n\np. 44\n\n\n\nBhagavan S\xc2\x92ankara knows Thee as Uma only made of Tamo Gu _n_ a; but, O Mother!\nnone of them knows Thy turiya form, transcending all the Gu _n_ as.\n\n\n\nO Mother! where is my humble self, that is of very dull intellect and\npowerless, and where is Thy extremely propitious serenity and graciousness!\nIndeed such a gracious favour on me is certainly beyond expectation.\nTherefore, O Bhavani! I have come to realise, in particular, that Thy heart is\nfull of unbounded mercy; for Thou dost certainly feel compassion for these\nBhaktas that are full of Bhakti towards Thee. O Mother! what more shall I say\nthan this, that Bhagavan Madhusudan Vi _sn_ u, though married to Kamala, born\nfrom only a part of Thine, considers Himself unfit of Her and is therefore not\nhappy; then the fact that He, the \xc3\x82di Puru _s_ a gets his feet shampooed by\nKamala merely corroborates the fact that He wants His feet to become pure and\nall auspicious to the world by the holy touch of Kamala's hands. O Mother! It\nseems to me that the ancient Puru _s_ a Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u wants gladly to be\nkicked by Thee like As'oka tree, for his own improvement and pleasure; and\ntherefore it is that Thou dost want, as if Thou hast become angry to kick\n(beat with one's legs) Thy husband, stricken by Smara (cupid, love) and\nworshipped by all the Devas, who lies prostrate below Thy feet.\n\n\n\nO Devi; when Thou always residest on the calm broad chest, as if on a great\ncot, adorned beautifully of Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, as lightning in deep dense\nblue clouds, then it is without doubt that He, becoming the Lord of the\nUniverse, has surely become Thy vahan (vehicle) (on account of carrying Thee\non His breast), O Mother! If Thou forsakest Madhusudana, out of wrath, He\nbecomes at once powerless and is not worshipped by any body; for it is seen\neverywhere that persons, though calm and serene, if devoid of S\xc2\x92ri (wealth and\npower) are forsaken by their relatives as reduced to a state having no\nqualities. O Mother! I am not to be ignored by Thee, on account of my being a\nwoman, for was it not the fact, that Brahma and the other Devas who always\ntake shelter of Thy lotus feet, had not all to assume once youthful feminine\nforms, while in Manidvipa, and I know this surely that Thou again didst make\nthem of male forms. Therefore, O Thou of unbounded power! What shall I\ndescribe about Thy power? Indeed, there is great doubt in my mind whether Thou\nart masculine or feminine? O Devi! Whoever Thou mayst be, whether with\nattributes on transcending the attributes, whether male or female, I always\nbow down to Thee, with heart full of devotion towards Thee. O Mother! I want\nthat I may have one unflinching devotion, towards Thee in my final state.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nSuta said :-- Thus praising the Devi, the king Sudyumna, in the form of the\nfeminine Ila, took refuge of the World Mother; and the Devi, becoming greatly\npleased, gave to the king, then and there, union with Her own\n\n\n\np. 45\n\n\n\nSelf. Thus the king got the highest steady place, so very rare even to the\nMunis, by the grace of the Prime Force, the Devi Brahmamayi.\n\n\n\nThus ends the Twelfth Chapter of the first Skandha on the birth of Pururava,\nin the Mahapura _n_ am S'rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyas.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 13](bk01ch13.htm)\n\n"
