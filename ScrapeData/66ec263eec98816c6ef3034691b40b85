When its strings are rightly strung, it\nmaddens the heart: but when the keys are broken and the strings are loosened,\nnone regard it more.  \nI tell my parents with laughter that I must go to my Lord in the morning; p.\n132\n\nThey are angry, for they do not want me to go, and they say: "She thinks she\nhas gained such dominion over her husband that she can have whatsoever she\nwishes; and therefore she is impatient to go to him."  \nDear friend, lift my veil lightly now; for this is the night of love.  \nKabir says: "Listen to me! My heart is eager to meet my lover: I lie sleepless\nupon my bed. Remember me early in the morning!"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LXXXVI](sok087.htm)\n\n'
