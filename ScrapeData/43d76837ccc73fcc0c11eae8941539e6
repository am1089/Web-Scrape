Then they let her depart (in a vehicle from her father's house), or they\nlet her be taken away.\n\n2\\. Having put (the fire into a vessel) they carry that (nuptial) fire behind\n(the newly-married couple).\n\n3\\. It should be kept constantly.\n\n4. 4 If it goes out, (a new fire) should be kindled by attrition, or it should be fetched from the house of a _S_ rotriya.\n\n5\\. Besides, if (the fire) goes out, the wife or the husband should fast.\n\n6\\. When (the bridegroom with his bride) has come to his house, he says to\nher, 'Cross (the threshold) with thy right foot first; do not stand on the\nthreshold.'\n\n7\\. In the hall, in its easterly part, he puts down the fire and puts wood on\nit.\n\n8\\. To the west of the fire he spreads out a red bull's skin with the neck to\nthe east, with the hair outside.\n\np. 194\n\n9. 9 On that (skin) they both sit down facing the east or the north, so that the wife sits behind her husband, with (the verse), 'Here may the cows sit down, here the horses, here the men. Here may also Pushan with a thousand (sacrificial) gifts sit down.'\n\n10\\. They sit silently until the stars appear.\n\n11\\. When the stars have appeared, he goes forth from the house (with his\nwife) in an easterly or northerly direction, and worships the quarters (of the\nhorizon) with (the hemistich), 'Ye goddesses, ye six wide ones' (Taitt. Sa _m_\nh. IV, 7, 14, 2).\n\n12. 12 (He worships) the stars with (the Pada), 'May we not be deprived of our offspring;'\n\n13\\. The moon with (the Pada), 'May we not get into the power of him who hates\nus, O king Soma!\n\n14\\. He worships the seven _Ri_ shis (ursa major) with (the verse), 'The seven\n_Ri_ shis who have led to firmness she, Arundhati, who stands first among the\nsix K _ri_ ttikas (pleiads):\xc2\x97may she, the eighth one, who leads the\nconjunction of the (moon with the) six K _ri_ ttikas, the first (among\nconjunctions) shine upon us!' Then he worships the polar star with (the\nformula), 'Firm dwelling, firm origin. The firm one art thou, standing on the\nside of firmness. Thou art the pillar of the stars; thus protect me against my\nadversary.\n\nAdoration be to the Brahman, to the firm, immovable one! Adoration be to the\nBrahman's son, Pra _g_ apati! Adoration to the Brahman's children,\n\np. 195\n\nto the thirty-three gods! Adoration to the Brahman's children and\ngrandchildren, to the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras!\n\nHe who knows thee (the polar star) as the firm, immovable Brahman with its\nchildren and with its grandchildren, with such a man children and\ngrandchildren will firmly dwell, servants and pupils, garments and woollen\nblankets, bronze and gold, wives and kings, food, safety, long life, glory,\nrenown, splendour, strength, holy lustre, and the enjoyment of food. May all\nthese things firmly and immovably dwell with me!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[193:4](sbe30065.htm#fr_624) 22, 4 'If the fire on which they had put wood,\nwas a fire produced by attrition, (the new fire) should (also) be kindled by\nattrition. If it was a common (laukika) fire that they had fetched, (the new\nfire) should be fetched from a Srotriya's house.
