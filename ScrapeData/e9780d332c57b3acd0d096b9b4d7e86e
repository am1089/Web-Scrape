And even if it be admitted; on account of the absence of a purpose.\n\nEven if it were admitted that the Pradhana is established by Inference, the Sa\n_n_ khya theory could not be accepted for the reason that the Pradhana is\nwithout a purpose. For, according to the view expressed in the passage, 'In\norder that the soul may know the Pradhana and become isolated' (Sa _n_ khya\nKa. I, 21), the purpose of the Pradhana is fruition and final release on the\npart of the soul; but both these are impossible. For, as the soul consists of\npure intelligence, is inactive, changeless, and spotless, and hence eternally\nemancipated, it is capable neither of fruition which consists in consciousness\nof Prak _ri_ ti, nor of Release which consists in separation from Prak _ri_\nti. If, on the other hand, it be held that the soul constituted as described\nis, owing to the mere nearness of Prak _ri_ ti, capable of fruition, i.e. of\nbeing conscious of pleasure and pain, which are special modifications of Prak\n_ri_ ti, it follows that, as Prak _ri_ ti is ever near, the soul will never\naccomplish emancipation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 9.
