 \nAnd grief upon his spirit weighed.  \nTo every quarter of the sky  \nHe turned in fear his anxious eye,  \nAnd roving still from spot to spot  \nWith troubled steps he rested not.  \nHe durst not, as he viewed the pair,  \nResolve to stand and meet them there:  \n\nAnd drooping cheer and quailing breast  \nThe terror of the chief confessed.  \nWhile the great fear his bosom shook,  \nBrief counsel with his lords he took;  \nEach gain and danger closely scanned,  \nWhat hope in flight, what power to stand,  \nWhile doubt and fear his bosom rent,  \nOn Raghu\'s sons his eyes he bent,  \nAnd with a spirit ill at ease  \nAddressed his lords in words like these:  \n   \'Those chiefs with wandering steps invade  \nThe shelter of our pathless shade,  \nAnd hither come in fair disguise  \nOf hermit garb as Bali\'s spies.\'  \n   Each lord beheld with troubled heart  \nThose masters of the bowman\'s art,  \nAnd left the mountain side to seek  \nSure refuge on a loftier peak.  \nThe Vanar chief in rapid flight  \nFound shelter on a towering height,  \nAnd all the band with one accord  \nWere closely gathered round their lord.  \nTheir course the same, with desperate leap  \nEach made his way from steep to steep,  \nAnd speeding on in wild career  \nFilled every height with sudden fear.  \nEach heart was struck with mortal dread,  \nAs on their course the Vanars sped,  \nWhile trees that crowned the steep were bent  \nAnd crushed beneath them as they went.  \nAs in their eager flight they pressed  \nFor safety to each mountain crest,  \nThe wild confusion struck with fear  \nTiger and cat and wandering deer.  \nThe lords who watched Sugriva\'s will  \nWere gathered on the royal hill,  \nAnd all with reverent hands upraised  \nUpon their king and leader gazed.  \nSugriva feared some evil planned,  \nSome train prepared by Bali\'s hand.  \nBut skilled in words that charm and teach,  \nThus Hanuman  1b began his speech:  \n   Dismiss, dismiss thine idle fear,  \nNor dread the power of Bali here.  \nFor this is Malaya\'s glorious hill  2b  \nWhere Bali\'s might can work no ill.  \nI look around but nowhere see  \nThe hated foe who made thee flee,  \nFell Bali, fierce in form and face:  \nThen fear not, lord of Vanar race.  \nAlas, in thee I clearly find  \nThe weakness of the Vanar kind,  \n\np. 325  \n\nThat loves from thought to thought to range,  \nFix no belief and welcome change.  \nMark well each hint and sign and scan,  \nDiscreet aud wise, thine every plan.  \nHow may a king, with sense denied,  \nThe subjects of his sceptre guide?\'  \n    Hanuman,  1 wise in hour of need,  \nUrged on the chief his prudent rede.  \nHis listening ear Sugriva bent,  \nAnd spake in words more excellent:  \n    \'Where is the dauntless heart that free  \nFrom terror\'s chilling touch can see  \nTwo stranger warriors, strong as those,  \nEquipped with swords and shafts and bows,  \nWith mighty arms and large full eyes,  \nLike glorious children of the skies  \nBali my foe, I ween, has sent  \nThese chiefs to aid his dark intent.  \nHence doubt and fear disturb me still,  \nFor thousands serve a monarch\'s will,  \nIn borrowed garb they come, and those  \nWho walk disguised are counted foes.  \nWith secret thoughts they watch their time,  \nAnd wound fond hearts that fear no crime  \nMy foe in state affairs is wise,  \nAnd prudent kings have searching eyes.  \nBy other hands they strike the foe:  \nBy meaner tools the truth they know.  \nNow to those stranger warriors turn,  \nAnd, less than king, their purpose learn.  \nMark well the trick and look of each;  \nObserve his form and note his speech.  \nWith care their mood and temper sound,  \nAnd, if their minds be friendly found,  \nWith courteous looks and words begin  \nTheir confidence and love to win.  \nThen as my friend and envoy speak,  \nAnd question where the strangers seek.  \nAsk why equipped with shaft and bow  \nThrough this wild maze of wood they go.  \nIf does, O chief, as first appear  \nPure of all guile, in heart sincere,  \nDetect in speech and look the sin  \nAnd treachery that lurk within.\'  \n    He spoke: the Wind-God\'s son obeyed.  \nWith ready zeal he sought the shade,  \nAnd reached with hasty steps the wood  \nWhere Ragbu\'s son and Lakshman stood. 2  \n\nThe envoy in his faithful breast  \nPondered Sugriva\'s high behest.  \nFrom Rishyamuka\'s peak he hied  \nAnd placed him by the princes\' side.  \nThe Wind-God\'s son with cautious art  \nHad laid his Vanar form apart,  \nAnd wore, to cheat the strangers eyes,  \nA wandering mendicant\'s disguise.  1b  \nBefore the heroes\' feet he bent  \nAnd did obeisance reverent,  \nAnd spoke, the gloirious pair to praise,  \nHis words of truth in courteous phrase,  \nHigh honour duly paid, the best  \nOf all the Vanar kind addressed,  \nWith free accord and gentle grace,  \nThose glories of their warrior race:  \n   \'O hermits, blest in vows, who shine  \nLike royal saints or Gods divine,  \nO best of young ascetics, say  \nHow to this spot you found your way,  \nScaring the troops of wandering deer  \nAnd silvan things that harbour here  \nSearching amid the trees that grow  \nWhere Pampa\'s gentle waters flow.  \nAnd lending from your brows a gleam  \nOf glory to the lovely stream.  \nWho are you, say, so brave and fair.  \nClad in the bark which hermits wear?  \nI see you have the frequent sigh,  \nI see the deer before you fly.  \nWhile you, for strength and valour dread,  \nThe earth, like lordly lions, tread,  \nEach bearing in his hand a bow,  \nLike Indra\'s own, to slay the foe,  \nWith the grand paces of bull,  \nSo bright and young and beautiful  \nThe mighty arms you raise appear  \nLike trunks which elephants uprear,  \nAnd as you move this mountain-king  2b  \nIs glorious with the light you bring.  \nHow have you reached, like Gods in face,  \nBest lords of earth, this lonely place,  \n\np. 326  \n\nWith tresses coiled in hermit guise, 1  \nAnd splendours of those lotus eyes?  \nAs God\'s who leave their heavenly sphere,  \nAlike your beauteous forms appear.  \nTne Lords of Day and Night 2 might thus  \nStray from the skies to visit us.  \nHeroic youth, so broad of chest,  \nFair with the beauty of the Blest,  \nWith lion shoulders, tall and strong,  \nLike bulls who lead the lowing throng.  \nYour arms, unmatched for grace and length,  \nWith massive clubs may vie in strength.  \nWhy do no gauds those limbs adorn  \nWhere priceless gems were meetly worn?  \nEach noble youth is fit, I deem,  \nTo guard this earth, as lord supreme,  \nWith all her woods and seas, to reign  \nFrom Meru\'s peak to Vindhya\'s chain.  \nYour smooth bows decked with dyes and gold  \nAre glorious in their masters\' hold,  \nAnd with the arms of Indra  3 vie  \nWhich diamond splendours beautify.  \nYour quivers glow with golden sheen,  \nWell stored with arrows fleet and keen,  \nEach gleaming like a flery snake  \nThat joys the foeman\'s life to take.  \nAs serpents cast their sloughs away  \nAnd all their new born sheen display,  \nSo flash your mighty swords inlaid  \nWith burning gold on hilt and blade.  \nWhy are you silent, heroes? Why  \nMy questions hear nor deign reply?  \nSugriva, lord of virtuous mind.  \nThe foremost of the Vanar kind.  \nAn exile from his royal state,  \nRoams through the land disconsolate.  \nI Hanuman, of Vanar race,  \nSent by the king have sought this place,  \nFor he, the pious, just, and true.  \nIn friendly league would join with you.  \nKnow, godlike youths, that I am one  \nOf his chief lords, the Wind-God\'s son.  \nWith course unchecked I roam will,  \nAnd now from Rishyamuka\'s hill.  \nTo please his heart, his hope to speed,  \nI came disguised in beggar\'s weed.\'  \n   Thus Hanuman, well trained in lore  \nOf language spoke, and said no more.  \nThe son of Raghu joyed to hear  \nThe envoy\'s speech, and bright of cheer  \nHe turned to Lakshman by his side,  \nAnd thus in words of transport cried:  \n   \'The counselor we now behold  \nOf King Sugriva righteous souled.  \n\nHis face I long have yearned to see,  \nAnd now his envoy comes to me  \nWith sweetest words in courteous phrase  \nAnswer this mighty lord who slays  \nHis foemen, by Sugriva sent.  \nThis Vanar chief most eloquent.  \nFor one whose words so sweetly flow  \nThe whole Rig-veda  1b needs must know,  \nAnd in his well-trained memory store  \nThe Yajush and the Saman\'s lore.  \nHe must have bent his faithful ear  \nAll grammar\'s varied rules to hear.  \nFor his long speech how well he spoke!  \nIn all its length no rule he broke.  \nIn eye, on brow, in all his face  \nThe keenest look no guile could trace.  \nNo change of hue, no pose of limb  \nGave sign that aught was false in him.  \nConcise, unfaltering, sweet and clear,  \nWithout a word to pain the ear.  \nFrom chest to throat, nor high nor low,  \nHis accents came in measured flow.  \nHow well he spoke with perfect art  \nThat wondrous speech that charmed the heart,  \nWith finest skill and order graced  \nIn words that knew nor pause nor haste!  \nThat speech, with consonants that spring  \nFrom the three seats of uttering, 2b  \nWould charm the spirit of a foe  \nWhose sword is raised for mortal blow.  \nHow may a ruler\'s plan succeed  \nWho lacks such envoy good at need?  \nHow fail, if one whose mind is stored  \nWith gifts so rare assist his lord?  \nWhat plans can fail, with wisest speech  \nOf envoy\'s lips to further each?\'  \n   Thus Rama spoke: and Lakshman, taught  \nIn all the art that utters thought,  \nTo King Sugriva\'s learned spy  \nThus made his eloquent reply:  \n\'Full well we know the gifts that grace  \nSugriva, lord of Vanar race,  \nAnd hither turn our wandering feet  \nThat we that high-souled king may meet  \nSo now our pleasant task shall be  \nTo do the words he speaks by thee.\'  \n   His prudent speech the Vanar heard,  \nAnd all his heart with joy was stirred.  \nAnd hope that league with them would bring  \nRedress and triumph to his king.  \n\np. 327  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[324:1](ry276.htm#fr_537) Sugriva, the ex-king of the Vanars, foresters, or\nmonkeys, an exile from his home, wandering about the mountain Rishyamuka with\nhis four faithful ex-ministers.\n\n[324:2](ry276.htm#fr_538) The hermitage of the Saint Matauga which his curse\nprevented Bali, the present king of the Vanars, from entering.
