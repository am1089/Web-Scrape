The Year, doubtless, is the same as Death; for he 1 it is who, by\nmeans of day and night, destroys the life of mortal beings, and then they die:\ntherefore the Year is the same as Death; and whosoever knows this Year (to be)\nDeath, his life that (year) does not destroy, by day and night, before old\nage, and he attains his full (extent of) life.\n\n10:4:3:22\\. And he, indeed, is the Ender, for it is he who, by day and night,\nreaches the end of the life of mortals, and then they die: therefore he is the\nEnder, and whosoever knows this Year, Death, the Ender, the end of his life\nthat (Year) does not reach, by day and night, before old age, and he attains\nhis full (extent of) life.\n\n10:4:3:33\\. The gods were afraid of this Pra _g_ apati, the Year, Death, the\nEnder, lest he, by day and night, should reach the end of their life.\n\n10:4:3:44\\. They performed these sacrificial rites--the Agnihotra, the New and\nFull-moon sacrifices, the Seasonal offerings, the animal sacrifice, and the\nSoma-sacrifice: by offering these sacrifices they did not attain immortality.\n\n10:4:3:55\\. They also built a fire-altar,--they laid down\n\np. 357\n\nunlimited enclosing-stones; unlimited Ya _g_ ushmati (bricks), unlimited\nLokamp _ri_ _n_ a (bricks), even as some lay them down to this day, saying,\n'The gods did so.' They did not attain immortality.\n\n10:4:3:66\\. They went on praising and toiling, striving to win immortality.\nPra _g_ apati then spake unto them, 'Ye do not lay down (put on me) all my\nforms; but ye either make (me) too large or leave (me) defective: therefore ye\ndo not become immortal.'\n\n10:4:3:77\\. They spake, 'Tell thou us thyself, then, in what manner we may lay\ndown all thy forms!'\n\n10:4:3:88\\. He spake, 'Lay ye down three hundred and sixty enclosing-stones,\nthree hundred and sixty Ya _g_ ushmati (bricks), and thirty-six thereunto; and\nof Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a (bricks) lay ye down ten thousand and eight hundred; and\nye will be laying down all my forms, and will become immortal.' And the gods\nlaid down accordingly, and thereafter became immortal.\n\n10:4:3:99\\. Death spake unto the gods, 'Surely, on this wise all men will\nbecome immortal, and what share will then be mine?' They spake, 'Henceforward\nno one shall be immortal with the body: only when thou shalt have taken that\n(body) as thy share, he who is to become immortal either through knowledge, or\nthrough holy work, shall become immortal after separating from the body.' Now\nwhen they said, 'either through knowledge or through holy work,' it is this\nfire-altar that is the knowledge, and this fire-altar that is the holy work.\n\n10:4:3:1010\\. And they who so know this, or they who do this holy work, come\nto life again when they have died, and, coming to life, they come to immortal\nlife. But they who do not know this, or do not do this\n\np. 358\n\nholy work, come to life again when they die, and they become the food of him\n(Death) time after time.\n\n10:4:3:1111\\. But when he builds the fire-altar, he thereby gains Agni, Pra\n_g_ apati, the Year, Death, the Ender, whom the gods gained; it is him he lays\ndowny even as the gods thus laid him down.\n\n10:4:3:1212\\. By the enclosing-stones he gains his nights; by the Ya _g_\nushmati (bricks) his days, half-moons, months, and seasons; and by the Lokamp\n_ri_ _n_ as the muhurtas (hours).\n\n10:4:3:1313\\. Thus the enclosing-stones, supplying the place of nights, are\nmade the (means of) gaining the nights, they are the counterpart of the\nnights: there are three hundred and sixty of them, for there are three hundred\nand sixty nights in the year. Of these, he lays twenty-one round the\nGarhapatya, seventy-eight round the Dhish _n_ ya hearths, and two hundred and\nsixty-one round the \xc3\x82havaniya.\n\n10:4:3:1414\\. Then the Ya _g_ ushmati (bricks with special formulas):--the\ngrass-bunch, the (four) clod-bricks, the lotus-leaf, the gold plate and man,\nthe two spoons, the naturally-perforated (brick), the durva-brick, the (one)\ndviya _g_ us, two reta _h_ si _k_ , a vi _s_ va _g_ yotis, two seasonal ones,\nan asha _dh_ a, the tortoise, the mortar and pestle, the fire-pan, the five\nvictims' heads, fifteen apasyas, five _kh_ andasyas, fifty pra _n_ abh _ri_ ts\n--these ninety-eight are (in) the first layer.\n\n10:4:3:1515\\. Then the second (layer):--five a _s_ vinis, two seasonal ones,\nfive vai _s_ vadevis, five pra _n_ abh _ri_ ts, five apasyas, nineteen\nvayasyas--these forty-one are (in) the second layer.\n\n10:4:3:1616\\. Then the third (layer):--the naturally-perforated one, five\nregional ones, a vi _s_ va _g_ yotis, four seasonal ones, ten pra _n_ abh _ri_\nts, thirty-six _kh_ andasyas,\n\np. 359\n\nfourteen valakhilyas--these seventy-one are (in) the third layer.\n\n10:4:3:1717\\. Then the fourth (layer):--first eighteen, then twelve, then\nseventeen--these forty-seven are (in) the fourth layer.\n\n10:4:3:1818\\. Then the fifth (layer):--five asapatnas, forty vira _g_ s,\ntwenty-nine stomabhagas, five nakasads, five pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ as,\nthirty-one _kh_ andasyas, eight (of) the Garhapatya hearth, eight (of) the\nPuna _s_ _k_ iti, two seasonal ones, a vi _s_ va _g_ yotis, a vikar _n_ i, a\nnaturally-perforated one, the variegated stone, the fire which is placed on\nthe altar--these one hundred and thirty-eight are (in) the fifth layer.\n\n10:4:3:1919\\. All these make three hundred and ninety-five. Of these, three\nhundred and sixty, supplying the place of days, are made the (means of)\ngaining the days, they are the counterpart of the days: There are three\nhundred and sixty of them, for there are three hundred and sixty days in the\nyear. And for the thirty-six (additional days) which there are 1 the filling\nof earth (counts as) the thirty-sixth; and twenty-four thereof, supplying the\nplace of half-moons, are made the (means of) gaining the half-moons, they are\nthe counterpart of the half-moons. And the (remaining) twelve, supplying the\nplace of months, are made the (means of) gaining the months, they are the\ncounterpart of the months. And, lest the seasons should be wanting, these\n(twelve bricks), by two and two (taken) together, supply the place of seasons.\n\np. 360\n\n10:4:3:2020\\. And as to the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a (space-filling bricks),\nsupplying the place of muhurtas (hours), they are made the (means) of gaining\nthe muhurtas, they are the counterpart of the muhurtas: there are ten thousand\nand eight hundred of them, for so many muhurtas there are in the year. Of\nthese, he lays down twenty-one in the Garhapatya (altar), seventy-eight in the\nDhish _n_ ya-hearths, and the others in the \xc3\x82havaniya. So many, indeed, are\nthe (different) forms of the year: it is these that are here secured for him\n(Pra _g_ apati, the Year), and are put on him.\n\n10:4:3:2121\\. Now, some wish to get this total amount 1 in the \xc3\x82havaniya\nitself, arguing, 'Those are different brick-built fire-altars: why should we\nhere (in the \xc3\x82havaniya altar) take into account those laid down there (in the\nGarhapatya and Dhish _n_ yas)?' But let him not do so. There are, indeed, ten\nof these fire-altars he builds--eight Dhish _n_ yas, the \xc3\x82havaniya and the\nGarhapatya--whence they say, 'Agni is Vira _g_ (wide shining or ruling),' for\nthe Vira _g_ (metre) consists of ten syllables: but, surely, all these (altars\nand hearths) are looked upon as only one, as Agni; for it is merely forms of\nhim that they all are,--even as the days and nights, the half-moons, the\nmonths, and the seasons (are forms) of the year, so are they all forms of him\n(Agni).\n\n10:4:3:2222\\. And, assuredly, they who do this put those forms of his 2\noutside of him, and produce confusion between the better and the worse; they\nmake the peasantry equal and refractory to the nobility. Surely, on the\n\xc3\x82gnidhriya he places the variegated\n\np. 361\n\nstone 1, and that he takes into account: why, then, taking that into account,\nshould he not take others into account? That (altar) by which they ward off\nNir _ri_ ti 2, evil, is the eleventh.\n\n10:4:3:2323\\. As to this they say, 'Why, then, do they not take into account\nhere those (of Nir _ri_ ti's altar)?' Because he makes no offering on them,\nfor it is by offering that a brick becomes whole and complete.\n\n10:4:3:2424\\. As to this they say, 'How are these (bricks) of his laid down so\nas not to be excessive?' Well, these (bricks) are his (Agni's) vital power,\nand man's vital power is not excessive. Thus whosoever, knowing this, performs\nthis holy work, or he who but knows this, makes up this Pra _g_ apati whole\nand complete.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[356:1](sbe4363.htm#fr_707) Father Time, Pra _g_ apati.\n\n[359:1](sbe4363.htm#fr_708) Namely, in an intercalary month.
