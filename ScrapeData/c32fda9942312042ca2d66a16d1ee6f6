Now henceforth we shall declare the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as.\n\n2 2. When (a pupil) is going to return (from his teacher), let him keep that\nfire (as his domestic fire) on which he has put the last piece of wood (as\nrequired by the regulations for a student),\n\n3\\. Or (he should keep) his nuptial fire.\n\np. 13\n\n4\\. Some declare (that the domestic fire should be kindled) at the time of the\ndivision of the inheritance.\n\n5 5. Or that after the death of the householder the eldest one himself (should\nkindle it).\n\n6\\. (It should be kindled) on the day of the new moon of the month of Vai _s_\nakha or on another (new moon day).\n\n7\\. Some say (that the fire should be kindled) according to the (sacrificer's)\nwishes under the (corresponding) constellation.\n\n8 8. He should light his fire at one of the following places, viz. in the\nhouse of a Vai _s_ ya who is rich in\n\np. 14\n\ncattle, at a frying-pan, or (at the fire of) one who offers many sacrifices.\n\n9 9-11. Some say that (the fire should be fetched from one of the above-\nmentioned places) in the evening and in the morning.\n\n10\\. The inauguration (of the fire) by an evening offering should be learnt\nfrom the Adhvaryus, according to (my) teacher.\n\n11\\. In the morning he shall offer a full oblation with a verse sacred to Vish\n_n_ u, or silently.\n\n12 12. The time for setting it (i.e. the domestic fire) in a blaze and for\nsacrificing on it has been explained by (the rules given with regard to) the\nAgnihotra.\n\np. 15\n\n13 13. And 'invested with the sacrificial cord,' &c., all these rules, as far\nas they are applicable, should be applied (here also) in consequence of the\nunity of the ritual.\n\n14\\. With regard to this they quote also (the following _S_ loka):\n\n15 15. 'The kinds of Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, the kinds of Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, and\nagain the kinds of Soma sacrifices,\n\n'Twenty-one by number, these are proclaimed to be the kinds of sacrifice.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[12:1](sbe29003.htm#fr_13) I, 1. The ceremonies to be treated of are defined\nhere as the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as (i.e. oblations of cooked offerings) just as in\nthe opening sentence of the Paraskara-G _ri_ hya they are called g _ri_\nhyasthalipakas. This is indeed the most characteristic form of offerings\nbelonging to the domain of the G _ri_ hya ritual, though it would not be\ncorrect to state that the G _ri_ hya-sutras treat exclusively of sacrificial\nceremonies of this kind.\n\n[12:2](sbe29003.htm#fr_14) As to the duty of the Vedic student of putting\nevery day a piece of wood on the sacred fire of his teacher, see below, II, 6,\n8, and compare the G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha-pari _s_ ish _t_ a II, 58.\nAccording to a Karika given by Naraya _n_ a, and the Karmapradipa (I, 6, 13).\nthe prescription of this Sutra regarding the time for the kindling of the\nsacred fire refers exclusively to the case of vagdana (betrothal). Comp. also\nDr. Bloomfield's note on the G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha-pari _s_ ish _t_ a I, 76\n(Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, XXXV, 560). In the\nKarika it is stated that if the betrothed girl dies after the fire has been\nkindled, but before the marriage, the sacrificer is not to forsake his fire,\nbut to marry another girl; if he cannot find a bride, he should make the fire\nenter into himself according to the rules given by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya V,\n1, and himself become uttara _s_ ramin, i.e. enter one of the two final \xc3\x82 _s_\nramas.\n\n[13:5](sbe29003.htm#fr_15) Naraya _n_ a: 'If the fire has not been kindled at\nthe time stated above, then, after the householder . . . i.e. the father, even\nif he should not have performed the adhana, or the elder brother has died, the\neldest son (or the son who after his elder brother's death has become the\neldest), after he has performed the Sapi _n_ _d_ ikara _n_ a (for the dead\nfather or brother; see below, IV, 3, and the ninth chapter of the Pari _s_ ish\n_t_ a [book V]), even if he has not divided the inheritance with his younger\nbrothers (so that the time stated in the fourth Sutra would not have arrived),\nshould kindle the fire himself, i.e. without an officiating priest ( _ri_ tvi\n_g_ ). . . . Or the Sutra should be divided into two; prete va g _ri_ hapatau\n(or after the death of the householder), and svaya _m_ _g_ yayan (the eminent\none himself), i.e. of Brahma _n_ as, Kshatriyas, and Vai _s_ yas a _g_ yayan,\nwhich means a most eminent person, a Brahma _n_ a, performs the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nas himself; for the two other castes the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as have to be\nperformed through an officiating priest: this is the meaning of this svaya _m_\n(himself).' I have given this note of Naraya _n_ a as a specimen of the\nentirely arbitrary and obviously misleading explanations which are\nunfortunately so frequently found in this author, as indeed in most of the\nother Sutra commentators. As to the true meaning of this svaya _m_ I still\nadhere to the explanation which I proposed in my German edition of the text\n(p. 118), that in case no division of the inheritance takes place, the sacred\nfire should be kindled on behalf of all the joint-proprietors, but that only\nthe eldest brother should act personally (svaya _m_ ).\n\n[13:8](sbe29003.htm#fr_16) Or, 'at (the fire of) a person rich in cattle, in\nthe house of a Vai _s_ ya,' &c.? The commentators (see p. 118 of the German p.\n14 edition) differ as to whether in purupa _s_ u-vi _t_ kula one or two\nalternatives are contained, and it is interesting to see that the Sutra\nauthors themselves differed in this respect; Paraskara (I, 2, 3), when\ndeclaring from what place the fire should be fetched, speaks of the house of a\nVai _s_ ya rich in cattle; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, on the contrary, who in the G _ri_\nhya-sutra does not expressly treat of the kindling of the domestic fire, in\nthe corresponding passage of the _S_ rauta-sutra (II, 2, 1), gives the rule\nthat the dakshi _n_ agni is to be fetched from the house of a Vai _s_ ya or\nfrom a rich person.'\n\n[14:9-11](sbe29003.htm#fr_17) 9-11. I now differ from the opinion which I\npronounced in my German edition with regard to the relation in which these\nthree Sutras stand to each other. I think they ought to be understood thus: 9.\nSome teachers say that the fetching of the fire from its yoni, as taught in\nSutra 8, ought to be done twice; in the evening, so that the fire, after the\nnecessary rites have been performed, goes out, and then again in the morning.\n10. But my (the author's) teacher (comp. as to a _k_ arya _h_ , Katyayana's\n_S_ rauta-sutra I, 3, 7; Professor Garbe's note on Vaitana-sutra 1, 3) is of\nopinion that the fire should be fetched only once, and that with this fire the\nceremonies which are taught by the Adhvaryus are to be performed in the\nevening (see, for instance, Katy. IV, 7. 8, which passage is paraphrased here\nby Naraya _n_ a). 11. In the morning (according to the same teacher, not, as I\nonce understood this passage, according to the eke referred to in Sutra 9), a\nfull oblation is to be offered, &c.\n\n[14:12](sbe29003.htm#fr_18) _S_ rauta-sutra II, 6, 2 seq.\n\n[15:13](sbe29003.htm#fr_19) _S_ rauta-sutra I, 1, 6. 7: ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ opaviti\ndevakarma _n_ i karoti, pra _k_ inaviti pitrya _n_ i, &c. The unity of the\nritual of course means the unity of the two great domains of the _S_ rauta and\nG _ri_ hya ritual.\n\n[15:15](sbe29003.htm#fr_20) With regard to the twenty-one kinds of sacrifice\ncompare, for instance, Gautama VIII, 18-20; Max Muller, Z _D_ _M_ _G_. IX, p.\nlxxiii; Weber, Indische Studien, X, 326. The seven kinds of Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as\nare the Ash _t_ aka sacrifices (see below, III, 12 seq.), the sacrifices\noffered at each Parvan (I, 3), the _S_ raddha (or funeral) sacrifices (IV, 1\nseq.), the sacrifice of the _S_ rava _n_ i full moon (IV, 19), of the \xc3\x82grahaya\n_n_ i (IV, 17 seq.), of the _K_ aitri (IV, 19), and of the \xc3\x82 _s_ vayu _g_ i\n(IV, 16). The seven Havis sacrifices (belonging, as is the case also with the\nthird division of sacrifices, to the _S_ rauta ritual) are the Agnyadheya, the\nAgnihotra, the sacrifices of the full and new moon, the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a, the\nthree _K_ aturmasya sacrifices, the Niru _dh_ apa _s_ ubandha, and the\nSautrama _n_ i. The seven kinds of Soma sacrifices (of which the more ancient\ntexts mention only three or four sa _m_ sthas, see Weber, Indische Studien,\nIX, 1 20) are the Agnish _t_ oma, the Atyagnish _t_ oma, the Ukthya, the Sho\n_d_ a _s_ in, the Atiratra, the Aptoryama.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2](sbe29004.htm)\n\n"
