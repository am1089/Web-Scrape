 \nAnd sent his rapid envoys forth  \nTo east and west and south and north.  \nThey bent their airy course afar  \nAlong the paths of bird and star,  \nAnd sped through ether farther yet  \nWhere Vishnu's splendid sphere is set. 2  \nBy sea, on hill, by wood and lake  \nThey called to arms for Rama's sake,  \nAs each with terror in his breast  \nObeyed his awful king's behest.  \nThree million Vanars, fierce and strong  \nAs Anjan's self, a wondrous throng.  \nSped from the spot where Rama still  \nGazed restless from the woody hill.  \nTen million others, brave and bold,  \nWith coats that shone like burning gold,  \nCame flying from the mountain crest  \nWhere sinks the weary sun to rest.  \nImpetuous from the northern skies,  \nWnere Mount Kailasa's summits rise,  \nTen hundred millions hasted, hued  \nLike manes of lions, ne'er subdued:  \nThe dwellers on Himalaya's side,  \nWhose food his roots and fruit supplied,  \nWith rangers of the Vindhyan chain  \nAnd neighbours of the Milky Main.  3  \nSome from the palm groves where they fed,  \nSome from the woods of betel sped:  \nIn countless numbers, fierce and brave,  \nThey came from mountain, lake, and cave.  \n   As on their way the Vanars went  \nTo rouse each distant armament,  \nThey chanced that wondrous tree to view  \nThat on Himalaya's summit grew.  \nOf old upon that sacred height  \nWas wrought Mahes'var's  4 glorious rite,  \nWhich every God in heaven beheld,  \nAnd his glad heart with triumph swelled.  \nThere from pure seed at random sown  \nBright plants with luscious fruit had grown,  \nAnd, sweet as Amrit to the taste,  \nThe summit of the mountain graced.  \nWho once should eat the virtuous fruit  \nThat sprang from so divine a root,  \nOne whole revolving moon should be  \nFrom every pang of hunger free.  \n\nThe Vanars culled the fruit they found  \nRipe on the sacrificial ground  \nWith rare celestial odours sweet,  \nTo lay them at Sugriva's feet.  \nThose noble envoys scoured the land  \nTo summon every Vanar band  \nThen swiftly homeward at the head  \nOf countless armaments they sped.  \nThey gathered by Kishkindha's wall.  \nThey thronged Sugriva's palace hall,  \nAnd, richly laden, bare within  \nThat fruit of heavenly origin.  \nTheir gifts before their king they spread,  \nAnd thus in tones of triumph said:  \n'Through every land our way we took  \nTo visit hill and wood and brook,  \nAnd all thy hosts from east to west  \nFlock hither at their lord's behest.'  \nSugriva with delighted look  \nThe present of his envoys took.  \nThen bade them go, with gracious speech  \nRewarding and dismissing each.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[368:1](ry311.htm#fr_644) Valmiki and succeeding poets make the second vowel\nin this name long or Short at their pleasure.\n\n[368:1b](ry311.htm#fr_645) Some of the mountains here mentioned are fabulous\nand others it is impossible to identify.
