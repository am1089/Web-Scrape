Now in former times the gods appointed Agni to the chief (office),\nnamely, that of Hot _ri_ ; and having appointed him to the chief (office)\nsaying 'do thou carry this our oblation!' they cheered him up, saying,\n'Surely, thou art vigorous; surely, thou art equal to this!' thereby endowing\nhim with vigour, even as in our own days, when they appoint any one from among\ntheir kinsmen to the chief (office), they cheer him up saying 'surely, thou\nart vigorous; surely, thou art equal to this!' thereby endowing him with\nvigour. By what, therefore, he recites after this, he eulogizes him, puts\nvigour into him 2.\n\n1:4:2:22\\. 'O Agni, thou art great! O priest (brahma _n_ a), O Bharata!' for\nAgni, indeed, is the brahman\n\np. 115\n\n[paragraph continues] (sacerdotium): therefore he says 'O Brahma _n_ a!--O\nBharata' he says, because he (Agni) bears (bhar) the oblation to the gods:\ntherefore they say 'Agni is bharata (the bearer).' Or, he, being the breath,\nsustains (bhar) these creatures: therefore he says 'O Bharata (sustainer)!'\n\n1:4:2:33\\. He now calls on (Agni as) the ancestral (Hot _ri_ priest) 1. He\nthereby introduces him both to the _Ri_ shis and to the gods (as if he were to\nsay), 'Of great vigour is he who has obtained the sacrifice!' This is the\nreason why he calls on (Agni as) the ancestral (Hot _ri_ ).\n\n1:4:2:44\\. He calls from the remote end (of the sacrificer's\n\np. 116\n\nancestral line) downwards; for it is from the remote end downwards that a race\nis propagated. He (the Hot _ri_ ) also thereby propitiates the lord of\nseniority for him (the Sacrificer); for here among men the father comes first,\nthen the son, and then the grandson: this is the reason why he calls from the\nremote end downwards.\n\n1:4:2:55\\. Having named (him as) the ancestral one, he says, '(thou wert)\nkindled by the gods, kindled by Manu;' for in olden times the gods did kindle\nhim: for this reason he says 'kindled by the gods;' and 'kindled by Manu' he\nsays, because in olden times Manu did kindle him: for this reason he says\n'kindled by Manu.'\n\n1:4:2:66\\. He continues, 'Praised by the _Ri_ shis (wert thou);' for in olden\ntimes the _Ri_ shis did praise him: for this reason he says 'praised by the\n_Ri_ shis.'\n\n1:4:2:77\\. Further, 'Gladdened by bards (vipra);' for those bards, the _Ri_\nshis, indeed gladdened him: for this reason he says 'gladdened by bards.'\n\n1:4:2:88\\. Further, 'Celebrated by sages (kavi);' for those sages, the _Ri_\nshis, indeed celebrated him: this is why he says 'celebrated by sages.'\n\n1:4:2:99\\. Further, 'Sharpened by the brahman (the Veda or vedic formulas),'\nfor he is indeed sharpened by the brahman;--'the receiver of butter-\nofferings,' for he is indeed the receiver of butter-offerings.\n\n1:4:2:1010\\. Further, 'The leader of oblations (ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a), the carrier of\n(Soma-)sacrifices (adhvara),' for through him they lead forward all oblations,\nboth the domestic oblations and the others: this is why he says 'the leader of\noblations.'\n\n1:4:2:1111\\. 'The carrier (rathi) of sacrifices;' for being a cart (as it\nwere) he conveys the sacrifice to the\n\np. 117\n\ngods: this is the reason why he says 'the carrier of sacrifices.'\n\n1:4:2:1212\\. Further, 'The unsurpassed Hot _ri_ , the surpassing bearer of\noblations;' for him the Rakshas do not surpass (tar): for this reason he says\n'the unsurpassed (aturta) Hot _ri_.' 'The surpassing (tur _n_ i, rather\n'swift') bearer of oblations,' for he overcomes (tar) every evil: therefore he\nsays 'the surpassing bearer of oblations 1.'\n\n1:4:2:1313\\. Further, 'The mouth-vessel 2, the offering-spoon of the gods;'\nfor he, Agni, is indeed the vessel of the gods: therefore they make offerings\nin Agni to all the gods, he being the vessel of the gods. And, verily,\nwhosoever knows this, obtains the vessel of him whose vessel he desires to\nobtain 3.\n\n1:4:2:1414\\. Further, 'The cup from which the gods drink;' for from him, being\n(as it were) a cup, the gods drink (the Soma-libations): for this reason he\nsays 'the cup from which the gods drink.'\n\n1:4:2:1515\\. Further, 'Thou, O Agni! dost encompass the gods, as the felly the\nspokes;' 'in the same way in which the felly on all sides encompasses the\nspokes, so dost thou on all sides encompass the gods,' this is what he thereby\nsays.\n\n1:4:2:1616\\. 'Bring hither the gods for the sacrificer!' this he says in order\nthat he (Agni) may bring the gods\n\np. 118\n\nto this sacrifice 1.--'Bring Agni hither, O Agni!' this he says in order that\nhe may bring Agni to the butter-portion intended for Agni.--'Bring Soma\nhither!' this he says in order that he may bring Soma to the butter-portion\nintended for Soma. 'Bring Agni hither!' this he says in order that he (Agni)\nmay bring Agni hither to that indispensable 2 cake which is offered to Agni on\nboth occasions (at the new- and the full-moon sacrifices).\n\n1:4:2:1717\\. And (in the same way) according to the respective deities 3. He\nthen continues, 'Bring hither the butter-drinking gods!' this he says in order\nthat he may bring hither the prayagas and anuyagas (fore and after-offerings),\nfor the prayagas and anuyagas (represent) indeed the butter-drinking\ngods.--'Bring Agni hither for the Hot _ri_ ship!' this he says in order that\nhe may bring Agni hither for the office of Hot _ri_.[](errata.htm#5)\\--'Your\nown greatness bring hither!' this he says in order that he (Agni) may\n\np. 119\n\nbring hither his own greatness; his own greatness, in truth, is his voice:\nhence he says it in order that he may bring hither his voice 1.--'Bring thou\nhither (the gods), O _G_ atavedas 2, and offer up a good offering!' what\ndeities he bids him bring hither, with regard to those (deities) he thereby\nsays 'bring them hither!' When he says, 'offer up a good offering!' he means\nto say, 'sacrifice in the proper order!'\n\n1:4:2:1818\\. He recites (the invitatory prayer) 3 while standing, since it is\nyonder (sky) which he thereby recites; for, indeed, the invitatory prayer\n(signifies) yonder (sky), and by it he recites that which is yonder (sky).\nThis is the reason why he recites standing.\n\n1:4:2:1919\\. The offering-prayer 3 he pronounces while sitting, since the\noffering-prayer (represents) this (earth): hence no one pronounces the\noffering-prayer while standing; for the offering-prayer is\n\np. 120\n\nthis earth, and by it he pronounces that which is this (earth). This is the\nreason why he pronounces the offering-prayer while sitting.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[114:2](sbe1218.htm#fr_303) The invocations he now proceeds to recite, on the\ntermination of the samidhenis or kindling verses, belong to the class of\nformulas called nigada. In the present case, they consist of the pravara\nmantra--or formula by which Agni is invited to assist the sacrificer as Hot\n_ri_ or Invoker on the present occasion, as he has of old assisted his\nancestors (cf. the following note)--and of short detached formulas called\nnivid. Saya _n_ a on Taitt. S. II, 5, 8.\n\n[115:1](sbe1218.htm#fr_304) \xc3\x82rsheyam prav _ri_ nite, literally 'he chooses the\nancestral' ( _ri_ shi). I take 'arsheyam' as a masculine adjective qualifying\na supplied '(Agni _m_ ) hotaram.' In this way the formula is explained by Saya\n_n_ a on I, 5, 1, 9 ( _ri_ shi _n_ a _m_ sambandhinam adhvaryur hotara _m_ v\n_ri_ _n_ ite), and this seems to me the most natural interpretation. It is\ntrue, however, that, as the formula ('he chooses the ancestral') became\nstereotyped, its exact import became forgotten, and arsheya was generally\ntaken as a neuter, either adjective (viz. 'namadheyam,' 'apatyam') or noun\n(ancestral lineage). Agni is invoked as the one who has of old officiated as\nthe Hot _ri_ of the sacrificer's ancestors, three or five ancestral names\nbeing usually mentioned: thus, in the case of a sacrificer belonging to the\n_G_ amadagna Vatsa family, claiming Bh _ri_ gu, _K_ yavana, Apnavana, Aurva,\nand _G_ amadagni as its founders, Agni is invoked, on the present occasion, as\n'Bhargava _K_ yavana \xc3\x82pnavana Aurva _G_ amadagna!' (\xc3\x82 _s_ val. Sr. 12, 10, 6;\nSaya _n_ a on Taitt. S. II, 5, 8). If the sacrificer belongs to the Kshatriya\nor Vai _s_ ya castes, the priest substitutes for the sacrificer's ancestors\nthose of his family priest (purohita) or his spiritual guide (guru); and in\nthe case of kings the same course was adopted, or the names of their royal\n_ri_ shi ancestors (ra _g_ arshi) were chosen. As to the second pravara, or\nthe election of the human Hot _ri_ , for the present sacrifice, see I, 5, 1,\n1. Cf. Max Muller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 386 seq.; A.\nWeber, Ind. Stud. IX, 325 seq.; X, 78 seq.; M. Haug, Aitar. Br., Translation,\np. 479.\n\n[117:1](sbe1218.htm#fr_305) At this point of the recitation a pause is made,\nduring which (as already partly during the preceding recitation) the Adhvaryu\nand \xc3\x82gnidhra engage in the acts detailed in I, 4, 4, 13 seq. Cf. Hillebrandt,\nNeu and Vollm. p. 81.\n\n[117:2](sbe1218.htm#fr_306) \xc3\x82s-patram: the fire is, as it were, the vessel\ninto which the sacrificial food is thrown and from which it is eaten by the\ngods.\n\n[117:3](sbe1218.htm#fr_307) ? Saya _n_ a supplies 'food:' he obtains the\nvessel of that food of which he wishes to obtain the vessel.\n\n[118:1](sbe1218.htm#fr_308) Here begins what is called the devatanam avahanam,\nor invitation (lit, bringing) of the deities to the oblations. Whilst the Hot\n_ri_ recites these formulas, the Adhvaryu performs what is set forth in I, 4,\n5, 2 seq.\n\n[118:2](sbe1218.htm#fr_309) A _k_ yuta, lit. 'not fallen,' i.e. immutable,\ninvariable. For the legendary explanation of this epithet of Agni and his\noblation, see I, 6, 1, 6; 2, 5-6.\n\n[118:3](sbe1218.htm#fr_310) The three preceding invocations are used alike at\nthe new- and full-moon sacrifices, but the subsequent ones differ according to\nthe oblations that are made, viz. a rice-cake to Indra-Agni (or an oblation of\nmixed milk and butter to Indra) at the new-moon ceremony; and to Agni-Soma at\nthe full-moon sacrifice. Previously to these an upa _m_ _s_ uya _g_ a or 'low-\nvoiced oblation' is made by some to Agni-Soma at the full moon, and one to\nVish _n_ u (or to Agni-Soma) at the new-moon sacrifice; according to others\nalso one to Pra _g_ apati,--the names of the gods being whispered in the\nrespective formulas.\n\n[119:1](sbe1218.htm#fr_311) Saya _n_ a on Taitt. S. II, 5, 9 explains the\nformula 'Bring hither the own greatness' by 'bring hither whatever greatness\nor power is peculiar to each of the havis-eating gods,' and he remarks\nexpressly that it is not to be referred to Agni, as our author certainly\nappears to do. Cf. I, 7, 3, 13.\n\n[119:2](sbe1218.htm#fr_312) _G_ atavedas probably means 'he who knoweth (all)\nbeings,' but it is more generally explained by 'he who possesseth riches (or\nwisdom),' not to mention other interpretations. According to Haug, Ait. Br.\nvol. ii. p. 224, the proper meaning of the term is 'having possession of all\nthat is born, i.e. pervading it.' He further mentions that the _Ri_ shis are\nquite familiar with the idea of the fire being an all-pervading power; and\nthat by Gatavedas the 'animal fire' is particularly to be understood. Our\npresent formula 'a _k_ a vaha _g_ ataveda _h_ suya _g_ a _k_ a ya _g_ a'\nsomewhat differs from the corresponding formula of the Taitt. S. II, 5, 9, 5,\n'a _k_ agne devan vaha suya _g_ a _k_ a ya _g_ a _g_ ataveda _h_.'\n\n[119:3](sbe1218.htm#fr_314) For the anuvakya or invitatory prayer, and the ya\n_g_ ya or Offering-prayer, see [p. 135](sbe1222.htm#page_135) note.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 3.
