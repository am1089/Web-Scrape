(The meditations on members of sacrificial actions are) rather not (to be\ncombined), as the text does not state their going together.\n\nThe words 'rather not' discard the purvapaksha. The meditations resting on\nmembers of actions are not to be treated like what they rest on, because\nscripture does not state their going together. Scripture actually states the\ngoing together of the Stotras and other subordinate members of sacrificial\naction which are enjoined in the three Vedas; cp. passages such as 'After the\ntaking of the graha or the raising of the _k_ amasa he performs the Stotra;'\n'After the Stotra he recites;' 'Prastot _ri_ sing the Saman;' 'Hot _ri_ recite\nthe Ya _g_ ya for this; 'and so on. But, on the other hand, there are no\nanalogous texts expressly teaching the going together of the meditations.--But\nthe going together of the meditations is established by those texts which\nintimate the successive performance of the different constituent members of a\nsacrifice!--By no means, we reply. The meditations subserve the end of man,\nwhile the texts referred to by you establish only the going together of the\nudgitha and the like which subserve the purpose of the sacrifice. That the\nmeditations on the udgitha and so on--although resting on\n\np. 284\n\nmembers of sacrificial acts--yet subserve the end of man only in the same way\nas the godohana vessel does, we have already explained under III, 3, 42.--And\nthis very difference between members of sacrificial action and the meditations\nresting on them, viz. that the former subserve the purpose of the sacrifice\nwhile the latter subserve the end of man, is founded on the express teaching\nof scripture 1.--And the further two indicatory marks (pointed out by the\npurvapakshin in Sutras 63 and 64) supply no reason for the going together of\nthe meditations, because no direct scriptural statement may be constructed\nfrom them. Nor 2 does the fact that in each sacrificial performance all\nfoundations of meditations are comprised, enable us to conclude that the\nmeditations founded on them are to be combined also; for the meditations are\nnot caused by what they rest on. The meditations, as resting on their\nfoundations, would, it may be admitted, not exist if those foundations did not\nexist. But therefrom it does not follow that the going together of the\nfoundations implies a necessary going together of the meditations; for as to\nthis we have no direct scriptural statement.--From all this it results that\nthe meditations may be performed according to one's liking.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[284:1](sbe38208.htm#fr_180) A remark refuting the averment made in Sutra 62.\n\n[284:2](sbe38208.htm#fr_181) And this is meant to refute the second\ninterpretation given of Sutra 64.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 66](sbe38209.htm)\n\n"
