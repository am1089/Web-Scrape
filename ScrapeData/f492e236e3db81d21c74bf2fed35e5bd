This body, O son of Kunti, is called Kshetra, and he who knows it is\ncalled Kshetrajna by those who know of them (Kshetra and Kshetrajna). 1\n\n2\\. Me do thou also know, O descendant of Bharata, to be Kshetrajna in all\nKshetras. The knowledge of Kshetra and Kshetrajna is considered by Me to be\nthe knowledge.\n\np. 290\n\n3\\. What the Kshetra is, what its properties are, what are its modifications,\nwhat effects arise from what causes, and also who He is and what His powers\nare, that hear from Me in brief. 3\n\n4\\. (This truth) has been sung by Rishis in many ways, in various distinctive\nchants, in passages indicative of Brahman, full of reasoning, and convincing.\n\np. 291\n\n5-6. The great Elements, Egoism, Intellect, as also the Unmanifested (Mula\nPrakriti), the ten senses and the one (mind), and the five objects of the\nsenses; desire, hatred, pleasure, pain, the, aggregate, intelligence,\nfortitude,--the Kshetra has been thus briefly described with its\nmodifications. 5\n\np. 292\n\n7\\. Humility, unpretentiousness, non-injury, forbearance, uprightness, service\nto the teacher, purity, steadiness, self-control; 7\n\np. 293\n\n8\\. The renunciation of sense-objects, and also absence of egoism; reflection\non the evils of birth, death, old age, sickness and pain; 8\n\np. 294\n\n9\\. Non-attachment, non-identification of self with son, wife, home, and the\nrest, and constant even-mindedness in the occurrence of the desirable and the\nun-undesirable; 9\n\n10\\. Unswerving devotion to Me by the Yoga of non-separation, resort to\nsequestered places, distaste for the society of men;  10\n\np. 295\n\n11\\. Constant application to spiritual knowledge, understanding of the end of\ntrue knowledge: this is declared to be knowledge, and what is opposed to it is\nignorance. 11\n\np. 296\n\n12\\. I shall describe that which has to be known, knowing which one attains to\nimmortality, the beginningless Supreme Brahman. It is called neither being nor\nnon-being.\n\n13\\. With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere,\nwith ears everywhere in the universe,--That exists pervading all.\n\n14\\. Shining by the functions of all the\n\np. 297\n\nsenses, yet without the senses; Absolute, yet sustaining all; devoid of Gunas,\nyet their experiencer.\n\n15\\. Without and within (all) beings; the unmoving and also the moving;\nbecause of Its subtlety incomprehensible; It is far and near. 15\n\n16\\. Impartible, yet It exists as if divided in beings: It is to be known as\n\np. 298\n\nsustaining beings; and devouring, as well as generating (them). 16\n\n17\\. The Light even of lights, It is said to be beyond darkness; Knowledge,\nand the One Thing to be known, the Goal of\' knowledge, dwelling in the hearts\nof all. 17\n\np. 299\n\n18\\. Thus Kshetra, knowledge, and that which has to be known, have been\nbriefly stated. Knowing this, My devotee is fitted for My state.\n\n19\\. Know thou that Prakriti and Purusha are both beginningless; and know thou\nalso that all modifications and Gunas are born of Prakriti. 19\n\n20\\. In the production of the body and the senses, Prakriti is said to be the\ncause; in the experience of pleasure and pain, Purusha is said to be the\ncause. 20\n\np. 300\n\n21\\. Purusha seated in Prakriti, experiences the Gunas born of Prakriti; the\nreason of his birth in good and evil wombs is his attachment to the Gunas. 21\n\np. 301\n\n22\\. And the Supreme Purusha in this body is also called the Looker-on, the\nPermitter, the Supporter, the Experiencer, the Great Lord, and the Highest\nSelf. 22\n\n23\\. He who thus knows the Purusha and Prakriti together with the Gunas,\nwhatever his life, is not born again. 23\n\np. 302\n\n24\\. Some by meditation behold the Self in their own intelligence by the\npurified heart, others by the path of knowledge, others again by Karma Yoga.\n\n25\\. Others again not knowing thus, worship as they have heard from others.\n\np. 303\n\n[paragraph continues] Even these go beyond death, regarding what they have\nheard as the Supreme Refuge. 25\n\n26\\. Whatever being is born, the moving or the unmoving, O bull of the\nBharatas, know it to be from the union of Kshetra and Kshetrajna. 26\n\np. 304\n\n27\\. He sees, who sees the Lord Supreme, existing equally in all beings,\ndeathless in the dying.\n\n28\\. Since seeing the Lord equally existent everywhere, he injures not Self by\nself, and so goes to the highest Goal. 28\n\np. 305\n\n29\\. He sees, who sees that all actions are done by Prakriti alone and that\nthe Self is actionless.\n\n30\\. When he sees the separate existence of all beings inherent in the One,\nand their expansion from That (One) alone, he then becomes Brahman.\n\np. 306\n\n31\\. Being without beginning and devoid of Gunas, this Supreme Self,\nimmutable, O son of Kunti, though existing in the body neither acts nor is\naffected. 31\n\n32\\. As the all-pervading Akasha, because of its subtlety, is not tainted, so\nthe Self existent in the body everywhere is not tainted.\n\np. 307\n\n33\\. As the one sun illumines all this world, so does He who abides in the\nKshetra, O descendant of Bharata, illumine the whole Kshetra.\n\n34\\. They who thus with the eye of knowledge perceive the distinction between\nthe Kshetra and the Kshetrajna, and also the emancipation from the Prakriti of\nbeings, they go to the Supreme. 34\n\n\n\nThe end of the thirteenth chapter designated, The Discrimination of the\nKshetra and the Kshetrajna.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[288:1](sbg18.htm#fr_276) This verse is omitted in many editions.\n\n[289:1](sbg18.htm#fr_277) _Kshetra:_ Literally, field; the body is so called\nbecause the fruits of action are reaped in it as in a field.\n\n[290:3](sbg18.htm#fr_278) _That:_ the true nature of Kshetra and Kshetrajna in\nall these specific aspects.\n\n[291:5](sbg18.htm#fr_279) The Sankhyas speak of those mentioned in the fifth\nSloka as the twenty-four Tattvas or Principles.\n\n_The great Elements_ --Mahabhutas--pervade all Vikaras, or modifications of\nmatter.\n\n_Aggregate_ --Samghata: combination of the body and the senses. p. 292\n\nDesire and other qualities which the Vaiseshikas speak of as inherent\nattributes of the Atman, are spoken of in the sixth Sloka as merely the\nattributes of Kshetra, and not the attributes of Kshetrajna. Desire and other\nqualities mentioned here, stand for all the qualities of the Antah-Karana or\ninner sense,--as mere mental states. Each of them, being knowable, is Kshetra.\n\nThe Kshetra, of which the various modifications in their totality are spoken\nof as "this body" in the first Sloka, has been here dwelt upon in all its\ndifferent forms, from \'The great Elements\' to \'fortitude.\'\n\n[292:7](sbg18.htm#fr_280) _Ach arya_--one who teaches the means of attaining\nMoksha.\n\n_Purity_ --external and internal. The former consists in washing away the dirt\nfrom the body by means of water &c., and the latter--the purity of p. 293 mind\n--consists in the removal from it the dirt of attachment and other passions,\nby the recognition of evil in all objects of the senses.\n\n[293:8](sbg18.htm#fr_281) _Sense-objects:_ such as sound, touch &c., of\npleasures seen or unseen.\n\n_Pain_ --whether Adhyatmic, _i.e._ , arising in one\'s own person, or\nAdhibhautic, _i.e._ , produced by external agents, or Adhidaivic, _i.e._ ,\nproduced by supernatural beings.\n\n_Reflection . . . pain_ --or the passage may be interpreted as--reflection on\nthe evils and miseries of birth, death, old age and sickness. Birth &c., are\nall miseries, not that they are miseries in themselves, but because they\nproduce misery. From such reflection arises indifference to sense-pleasures,\nand the senses turn towards the Innermost Self for knowledge.\n\n[294:9](sbg18.htm#fr_282) Identification of self--as in the case of a person\nwho feels happy or miserable when another to whom he is attached, is happy or\nmiserable, and who feels himself alive or dead when his beloved one is alive\nor dead.\n\n[294:10](sbg18.htm#fr_283) p. 295 _Resort . . . places_ --favourable to\nequanimity of mind, so that uninterrupted meditation on the Self, . and the\nlike, may be possible.\n\n_Society of men:_ of the unenlightened and undisciplined people, not of the\npure and holy, because association with the latter leads to Jnana.\n\n[295:11](sbg18.htm#fr_284) These attributes--from \'Humility\' to \'Understanding\nof the end of true knowledge\'--are declared to be knowledge, because they are\nthe means conducive to knowledge.\n\n[297:15](sbg18.htm#fr_285) _Incomprehensible_ --to the unillumined, though\nknowable in Itself.\n\n_Far_ --when unknown.\n\n_Near_ --to the illumined, because It is their own Self.\n\n[298:16](sbg18.htm#fr_286) _Devouring_ --at the time of Pralaya.\n\n_Generating_ --at the time of utpatti or origin of the universe.\n\n[298:17](sbg18.htm#fr_287) _The Light even of lights:_ --The illuminator of\nall illuminating things, such as the sun &c., and Buddhi &c. Indeed, these\nlatter shine only when illuminated by the Light of the consciousness of the\nSelf.\n\n[299:19](sbg18.htm#fr_288) _Modifications_ --Vikaras: From Buddhi down to the\nphysical body.\n\n[299:20](sbg18.htm#fr_289) p. 300 _Senses_ --five organs of perception, five\nof action, mind, intellect and egoism.\n\n_Purusha:_ the Jiva is meant here.\n\n_K arya:_ The effect, the physical body. Karana: Senses. Some read Karana, and\nexplain \'Karya and Karana\' as \'effect and cause.\'\n\n[300:21](sbg18.htm#fr_290) _Seated in:_ identifying himself with.\n\n_Gunas_ --manifesting themselves as pleasure, pain and delusion.\n\n[301:22](sbg18.htm#fr_291) _Looker-on, the Permitter_ --He himself does not\nparticipate in the activities of the bodily organs, the mind and the Buddhi,\nbeing quite apart from them, yet appears to be so engaged. And being a looker-\non, He never stands in the way of the activities of Prakriti as manifested in\nthe body. Indeed, all the consciousness or intelligence that manifests itself\nin the activities of life is but the reflection of the All-pervading, Absolute\nand Perfect Intelligence--the Supreme Spirit.\n\n[301:23](sbg18.htm#fr_292) _Whatever his life &c.:_ Whether he be engaged in\nprescribed or forbidden acts, he is not born again. For, the acts, the seeds\nof rebirth, of a knower of p. 302 Truth are burnt by the fire of knowledge,\nand thus cannot be effective causes to bring about births. In his case they\nare mere semblances of Karma; a burnt cloth, for instance, cannot serve the\npurposes of a cloth.\n\n[303:25](sbg18.htm#fr_293) _Not knowing thus:_ not able to know the Self\ndescribed above, by one of the several methods as pointed out.\n\n_From others:_ Acharyas or spiritual teachers.\n\n_Regarding_ --following with Shraddha.\n\n_What they have heard_ , _i.e._ , they solely depend upon the authority of\nothers\' instructions.\n\n[303:26](sbg18.htm#fr_294) _Union . . . Kshetrajna:_ The union of Kshetra and\nKshetrajna, of the object and the subject, is of the nature of mutual Adhyasa\nwhich consists in confounding them as well as their attributes with each\nother, owing to the absence of discrimination of their real nature. This false\nknowledge vanishes when one is able to separate Kshetra from Kshetrajna.\n\n[304:28](sbg18.htm#fr_295) _He injures . . . by self_ --like the ignorant man\neither by ignoring the Self in others (Avidya or nescience), or regarding the\nnon-Self (physical body, &c.) as the Self (Mithya-jnana or false\nknowledge)--the two veils that hide the true nature of the Self.\n\n[306:31](sbg18.htm#fr_296) _Being without beginning_ --having no cause.\n\n_Neither . . . affected_ --Because the Self is not the doer, therefore He is\nnot touched by the fruit of action.\n\n[307:34](sbg18.htm#fr_297) _Prakriti of beings:_ the material nature or\ndelusion of beings due to Avidya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fourteenth Chapter.
