Having wiped (around the surface on which he intends to perform a\nsacrifice), having besmeared it (with cowdung), having drawn the lines\nthereon, having taken the earth out (of the lines), having besprinkled (the\nplace with water), having established the (sacred) fire, having spread out the\nseat for the Brahman to the south, having carried forward (the Pra _n_ ita\nwater), having spread (Ku _s_ a grass) round (the fire), having put down (the\ndifferent things used at the sacrifice) according as they are wanted, having\nprepared two (Ku _s_ a blades used as) strainers, having consecrated the\nProksha _n_ i\n\np. 270\n\nwater, having sprinkled (with that water the sacrificial implements) according\nto what is needed, having poured out (the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya or sacrificial butter into\nthe pot), and having put the sacrificial butter on the fire, he should\n(lustrate the butter by) moving a fire-brand round it.\n\n3\\.

Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I, 1; \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana-G _ri_ hya I, 1, &c. It seems to me that Professor Stenzler is not\nquite right in giving to the opening words of the text athata _h_ , which he\ntranslates 'nun also,' the explanation: 'das heisst, nach Beendigung des _S_\nrauta-sutra von Katyayana.' I think rather it can be shown that ata _h_ does\nnot contain a reference to something preceding; thus the _S_ rauta-sutra,\nwhich forms the first part of the whole Sutra collection, is opened in the\nsame way by the words athato\xe0\xa4\xbddhikara _h_.\n\n[269:2](sbe29155.htm#fr_664) The description of the standard form of domestic\nsacrifice opens with an enumeration of the five so-called bhusa _m_ skara\n(parisamuhya, &c.). On the samuhana (for parisamuhya is derived p. 270 from\nthe root uh, not from vah; comp. below, II, 4, 2: pa _n_ inagnim\nparisamuhati), see _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 7, 11; G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha-pari _s_\nish _t_ a I, 37, &c. On the lines drawn on the sacrificial surface, see _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 7, 6 seq.; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I, 3, 1; G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha-pari\n_s_ ish _t_ a I, 47 seq.\n\n[270:4](sbe29155.htm#fr_665) Purvavat ('as above') can possibly, as Professor\nStenzler understands it, have been said with regard to Katyayana's rule, II,\n3, 33: Tabhyam (scil. pavitrabhyam) utpunati Savitur va iti. But it is also\npossible that the expression may refer to the second Sutra of this chapter,\nwhere it is said, proksha _n_ i _h_ sa _m_ sk _ri_ tya. On upayamanan ku _s_\nan, comp. Katyayana I, 10, 6-8.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2](sbe29156.htm)\n\n"
