The heavenly places were formed by\nhim, and the warlike gods are indebted to him for their wonder-working\nweapons. He sharpens the iron axe of Brahmanaspati (Agni), and forges the\nthunderbolts of Indra. He is intimately associated with men; he forms husband\nand wife for each other from the womb, and blesses the married couple with\noffspring. This accounts for the fact that the wives of the gods are his most\nconstant companions. He made the world and all that is in it; and he is the\nprotector of the creatures he has made. He shares with the other gods in the\nsacrifices offered by mortals. *\n\nTvastri is in several passages connected with the Ribhus. These were sons of a\nman named Sudhanvan; who, owing to their great skill in working, obtained\nimmortality and divine honours. The Ribhus made Indra\'s chariot and horses;\nalso by their great austerities restored their parents to youth. They are\nspoken of as the pupils of Tvastri. It was through their skill in\nmanufacturing four sacrificial cups out of one their\n\np. 76\n\nmaster had fashioned that they became divine. This exhibition was made at the\ncommand of the gods, and exaltation to deity the promised reward. Tvastri was\nvery angry at their success; and, ashamed of being seen, hid himself amongst\nthe women. It is said that he even tried to slay his pupils. According to\nother accounts, he admired their skill and was pleased at the result. Tvastri\nwas the father-in-law of Vivasvat (the Sun).\n\nIndra is occasionally described as being in a state of hostility towards\nTvastri and his son Visvar\xc5\xabpa, and ultimately caused the death of both. This\nVisvar\xc5\xabpa had three heads, called respectively, the Soma-drinker the Wine-\ndrinker, and the Food-eater. On one occasion he declared in public that the\nsacrifices should be shared by the gods only; but in private he said the\nasuras (demons) should share them too. And as it is customary to keep promises\nthat are privately made, Indra was afraid that the asuras, obtaining a share\nof the sacrifices, would be so strengthened as to be able to overthrow his\nkingdom; he therefore cut off the heads of Visvar\xc5\xabpa with his thunderbolt. The\nthree heads were turned into birds: the Soma-drinker became a Kapinjala (a\nFrancoline partridge), for Soma was of a brown colour the Wine-drinker became\na Kalavinka (sparrow), because when men are intoxicated they make a noise like\na sparrow; the Food-eater became a Tittiri (partridge), which consequently has\na great variety of colour, for its body appears to be sprinkled with glut-and\nhoney. Tvastri, enraged because Indra had slain his son, made a libation to\nthe gods, but did not invite Indra to it. Indra, noticing this slight, by\nforce took the vessel containing the Soma juice, and drank it. But he drank\nmore than was good for him. Tvastri, being angry, at once broke off the\nsacrifice, and used the few drops of\n\np. 77\n\n[paragraph continues] Soma left to give effect to a curse. He employed the\nright formula for accomplishing the death of Indra, but unfortunately laid\nstress upon the wrong word. So, instead of slaying Indra, he was himself slain\nby him. *\n\nIn the Pur\xc4\x81nas, Tvastri appears under the name of Visvakarma. In the "Vishnu\nPur\xc4\x81na" he is styled "the author of a thousand arts, the mechanist of the\ngods, the fabricator of ornaments, the chief of artists, the constructor of\nthe self-moving chariots of the deities, by whose skill men obtain\nsubsistence." Though not named as an \xc4\x80ditya in the Vedas, he is generally\nreckoned as one in the Pur\xc4\x81nas. In other places he is called a son of Brahm\xc4\x81.\nIn pictures he is represented as a white man with three eyes. In his right\nhand he carries a club. He wears a crown, and is adorned with a necklace and\nbracelets of gold. He is worshipped once, twice, thrice, or four times each\nyear, according to the devotion of his worshippers. Nowadays, no images of him\nare set up; each man worships the implements of his trade, as representatives.\nThe carpenter bows down to his hammer, saw, etc.; the bricklayer to his\ntrowel; the peasant to his plough; the student to his books; the clerk to his\npen. When the worship is over, the day is spent in feasting and enjoyment.\n\nThough, as we have seen in the Vedas, he is regarded in some hymns as the\nCreator and the Preserver, in the later books he occupies a much lower\nposition. Brahm\xc4\x81 is styled the Creator, and Vishnu the Preserver--whilst\nVisvakarma becomes a valued servant who fulfils the behests of his superiors.\nIt is for skill and power to work in their ordinary avocations that his aid is\nnow sought.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[75:*](hmvp13.htm#fr_79) Muir, O.
