Then N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, the supreme Purusha desired. "I shall create offspring."\nFrom N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a emanates pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, manas, the several organs of sense and action,\n\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, v\xc4\x81yu, agni, \xc4\x81pas and p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab that supports all. From N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a emanates\nBrahm\xc4\x81. From N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a emanates Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra. From N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a emanates In\xe1\xb8\x8dra. From\nN\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a emanates Praj\xc4\x81pa\xe1\xb9\xadi (the divine progenitor). From N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a emanates\nthe twelve \xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8di\xe1\xb9\xadyas, ru\xe1\xb8\x8dras, vasus, and all the chhan\xe1\xb8\x8das (Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das). From N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a\nonly do (all these) proceed. Through N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a do (they) prosper. In N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a\n(they) are absorbed. The \xe1\xb9\x9agve\xe1\xb8\x8da teaches this.\n\nThen N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a is eternal. Brahm\xc4\x81 is N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, \xc5\x9aiva is N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, In\xe1\xb8\x8dra is\nN\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, K\xc4\x81la (time) is N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, \xe1\xb8\x8cik (space) is N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, the intermediate\nquarters also are N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a; that which is above is N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, that which is\nbelow is N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, that which is in and out is N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, the whole universe\nwhich existed and will exist is N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a. N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a is the only one that is\nstainless, sinless, changeless, and unnameable, and that is pure and divine.\nThere is no second. Whoever knows Him thus, becomes Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u Himself. The\nYajurve\xe1\xb8\x8da teaches this.\n\nOne should utter "Om" first, then "nama\xe1\xb8\xa5," and then "N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81ya." "Om" (is) a\nsingle syllable; "Nama\xe1\xb8\xa5" contains two syllables: "N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81ya" contains five\nsyllables. This is the sentence known as the Asht\xc4\x81kshara 1 of N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\np. 129\n\n[paragraph continues] Whoever studies this Asht\xc4\x81kshara of N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a and recites\nit constantly, attains full life and supremacy over men, enjoys the pleasures\nof royalty and becomes the master of all souls. He attains moksha; yea, he\nattains moksha. The S\xc4\x81mave\xe1\xb8\x8da teaches this.\n\nThe Yogin having pronounced (the name of) Him who is complete bliss, who is\nBrahma-purusha and who is of the nature of Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava (Om)--a combination of A,\nU, and M--is released from the bondage of birth and mundane existence. He who\npractises the man\xe1\xb9\xadra "Om-Namo-N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81ya" reaches Vaiku\xe1\xb9\x87tha (the abode of\nVish\xe1\xb9\x87u). It is this lotus (heart). It is replete with vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na: It has the\nbrilliancy of lightning. The son of \xe1\xb8\x8cev\xc4\x81k\xc4\xab is Brahma\xe1\xb9\x87ya 1. Ma\xe1\xb8\x8dhus\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8dana is\nBrahma\xe1\xb9\x87ya. N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a who pervades all elements, who is one only, who is the\ncause Purusha and who is causeless, is known as Parabrahman. The A\xe1\xb9\xadharva\xe1\xb9\x87a\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d teaches this.\n\nWhoever recites (this Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d) in the morning destroys the sins committed\nthe night (before). Whoever recites it in the evening destroys the sins\ncommitted during the day. Whoever recites morning and evening becomes free\nfrom sins, however sinful he may be. Whoever recites (it) in the noon facing\nthe sun is freed from all the five 2 great sins as well as from the minor\nones. He derives the good effects of the recitation of all the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. Whoever\nknows thus attains S\xc4\x81yujya of N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a ( _viz_., is absorbed in the essence of\nN\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a). He attains S\xc4\x81yujya of N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a. Thus is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[128:1](tmu20.htm#fr_94) The eight syllables.\n\n[129:1](tmu20.htm#fr_95) Means Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u or Brahm\xc4\x81 devoted to \xe1\xb9\xacapas, Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das,\nTruth, and J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na.\n\n[129:2](tmu20.htm#fr_96) They are theft of gold, drinking alcohol, the murder\nof a Brahman, and unlawful union with the guru\'s wife and association with\nthem.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 19.
