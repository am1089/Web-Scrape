Not to one (element) (the soul goes); for both (i.e. scripture and Sm _ri_\nti) declare this.\n\nAt the time of passing over into another body the individual soul does not\nabide in the one element of heat only; for we see that the new body consists\nof various elements. This matter is declared in the question and answer about\nthe waters called man ( _Kh_. Up. V, 3, 3); as explained by us in III, 1, 2.--\nScripture and Sm _ri_ ti alike\n\np. 369\n\nteach this doctrine; compare e.g. 'Consisting of earth, water, wind, ether,\nheat' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 5); and 'The subtle perishable parts of the five\n(elements) from them all this is produced in due succession' (Manu I, 27).--\nBut is there not another scriptural text--beginning--'Where then is that\nperson?'--which teaches that at the time of the soul attaining a new body,\nafter speech and the other organs have been withdrawn within the soul, work\nconstitutes the soul's abode, 'What those two said, as work they said it; what\nthey praised, as work they praised it' (B _ri_. Up. III, 2. 13)?--That\npassage, we reply, describes the operation of bondage consisting of the senses\nand their objects--there called grahas and atigrahas--and therefore work is\nspoken of as the abode; here on the other hand the elements are said to be the\nabode because we have to do with the origination of a new body out of the\nmatter of the elements. The expression 'they prayed' moreover intimates only\nthat work occupies the chief place in the process, and does not exclude\nanother abode. The two passages therefore do not contradict each other.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 7](sbe38287.htm)\n\n"
