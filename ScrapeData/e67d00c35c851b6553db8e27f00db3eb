We choose Agni as our messenger, the all-possessor, as the Hot _ri_ of\nthis sacrifice, the highly wise.\n\n2\\. Agni and Agni again they constantly invoked with their invocations, the\nlord of the clans, the bearer of oblations, the beloved of many.\n\n3\\. Agni, when born, conduct the gods hither for him who has strewn the Barhis\n(sacrificial grass) [1](sbe46004.htm#an_1:12:3:1); thou art our Hot _ri_ ,\nworthy of being magnified [2](sbe46004.htm#an_1:12:3:2).\n\n4\\. Awaken them, the willing ones, when thou goest as messenger, O Agni. Sit\ndown with the gods on the Barhis.\n\n5\\. O thou to whom Gh _ri_ ta oblations are poured out, resplendent (god),\nburn against the mischievous, O Agni, against the sorcerers.\n\n6\\. By Agni Agni is kindled (or, by fire fire is kindled), the sage, the\nmaster of the house, the young one, the bearer of oblations, whose mouth is\nthe sacrificial spoon.\n\n7\\. Praise Agni the sage, whose ordinances for the sacrifice are true, the god\nwho drives away sickness.\n\n8\\. Be the protector, O Agni, of a master of sacrificial food who worships\nthee, O god, as his messenger.\n\n9\\. Be merciful, O purifier, unto the man who is rich in sacrificial food, and\nwho invites Agni to the feast of the gods.\n\n10\\. Thus, O Agni, resplendent purifier, conduct\n\np. 7\n\nthe gods hither to us, to our sacrifice and to our food.\n\n11\\. Thus praised by us with our new Gayatra hymn, bring us wealth of valiant\nmen and food.\n\n12\\. Agni with thy bright splendour be pleased, through all our invocations of\nthe gods, with this our praise.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to Medhatithi Ka _n_ va. It is the opening hymn of a\ncollection which extends from I, 12 to 23 (not, as Ludwig, III, 102, believes,\nfrom I, 2 to 17; see my Prolegomena, p. 220). That the authorship of this\ncollection belongs indeed to the Ka _n_ va family, whose poetical compositions\nare found partly in the first and partly in the eighth Ma _n_ _d_ ala, is\nshown by the text of 14, 2-5, and by other evidence; see Zeitschr. der\nDeutschen Morg. Gesellschaft, XXXVIII, 448.\n\nThe metre is Gayatri. It is possible, though I do not think it probable, that\nthe hymn should be considered as consisting of T _ri_ _k_ as. Verse 1 = SV. I,\n3; TS.
