They take eight mouthfuls (of food daily) and strive after moksha alone\nthrough the path of yoga. The second kind carry three (bamboo) staves (tied\ntogether) and a waterpot, and wear tuft of hair (\xc5\x9bikh\xc4\x81), sacred thread\n(yaj\xc3\xb1opav\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada) and red-coloured cloth. They take eight mouthfuls of food in the\nhouse of Brahma\xe1\xb9\x9bshis, abstain from flesh and alcohol and strive after\nemancipation alone through the path of yoga. Then the Hamsas should live not\nmore than a night in a village, five nights in a town, and seven nights in a\nsacred place, partaking daily of cow's urine and cow's dung, observing\nCh\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a 3 and striving after moksha alone through the path of yoga.\nParamahamsas like Samvar\xe1\xb9\xadaka, \xc4\x80ru\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab, \xc5\x9awe\xe1\xb9\xadake\xe1\xb9\xadu, Jadabhara\xe1\xb9\xada, \xe1\xb8\x8ca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadreya, \xc5\x9auka,\nV\xc4\x81ma\xe1\xb8\x8deva, H\xc4\x81r\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xadaka and others take eight mouthfuls and strive after moksha\nalone through the path of yoga. They live clothed or naked at the foot of\ntrees, in ruined houses, or in burning grounds. With\n\np. 133\n\nthem, there are no dualities as \xe1\xb8\x8dharma and a\xe1\xb8\x8dharma, gain and loss, and purity\nand impurity. They look upon gold and stone and clod of earth with the same\neye (of indifference), live on alms, begging from all without any distinction\nof caste and look upon everything as \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 alone. Being (naked) as nature made\nthem, being free from the sense of duality and from covetousness, being\nengaged in pure contemplation (\xc5\x9bukla\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na), meditating on \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, and begging\nat stated times, simply to keep the body and soul together, they reside in\nruined houses, temples, straw-huts, ant-hills, the foot of trees, potteries,\nthe places of agniho\xe1\xb9\xadra, the sand in the bed of rivers, mountain-caves,\ncavities, the hollows of trees, waterfalls, and s\xe1\xb9\xadha\xe1\xb9\x87dila (the level square\npiece of ground prepared for sacrifice). Having advanced far in the path of\nBrahman, and being pure in mind, they quit this body through the methods\nprescribed for Paramahamsa Sanny\xc4\x81sins. These are the Paramahamsas. Such is the\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[132:1](tmu22.htm#fr_101) One who lives on bhiksh\xc4\x81 or alms.
