Imprecation against enemies thwarting holy work.\n\n1\\. Heaven and earth, the broad atmosphere, the goddess of the field, and the\nwonderful, far-striding (Vishnu); moreover, the broad atmosphere guarded by\nVata (the wind): may these here be inflamed, when I am inflamed!  \n2\\. Hear this, O ye revered gods! Let Bharadvaga recite for me songs of\npraise! 'May he who injures this our plan be bound in the fetter (of disease)\nand joined to misfortune!  \n3\\. Hear, O soma-drinking Indra, what with burning heart I shout to thee! I\ncleave, as one cleaves a tree with an axe, him that injures this our plan.  \n4\\. With (the aid of) thrice eighty siman-singers, with (the aid of) the\n\xc3\x82dityas, Vasus, and Angiras--may our father's sacrifices and gifts to the\npriests, aid us-do I seize this one with fateful fervour.  \n5\\. May heaven and earth look after me, may all the gods support me! O ye\nAngiras, O ye fathers devoted to Soma, may he who does harm enter into\nmisfortune!  \n6 . He who perchance despises us, O ye Maruts, he who abuses the holy practice\nwhich is beiog performed by us, may his evil deeds be firebrands to him, may\nthe heavens surround with fire the hater of holy practices!  \n7\\. Thy seven in-breathings and thy eight marrows, these do I cut for thee by\nmeans of my charm. Thou shalt go to the seat of Yama, fitly prepared, with\nAgni as thy guide!  \n8\\. I set thy footstep upon the kindled fire. May Agni surround thy body, may\nthy voice enter into breath!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 70. Frustration of the sacrifice of an enemy](av096.htm)\n\n"
