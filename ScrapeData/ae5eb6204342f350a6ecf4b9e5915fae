'Spirit 1 (pra _n_ a) is better than hope. As the spokes of a wheel hold\nto the nave 2, so does all this (beginning with names and ending in hope) hold\nto spirit. That spirit moves by the spirit, it gives spirit to the spirit.\nFather means spirit, mother is spirit, brother is spirit, sister is spirit,\ntutor is spirit, Brahma _n_ a is spirit.\n\n2\\. 'For if one says anything unbecoming to a father, mother, brother, sister,\ntutor or Brahma _n_ a, then people say, Shame on thee! thou hast offended thy\nfather, mother, brother, sister, tutor, or a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n3\\. 'But, if after the spirit has departed from them, one shoves them together\nwith a poker, and burns them to pieces, no one would say, Thou offendest thy\nfather, mother, brother, sister, tutor or a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n4\\. 'Spirit then is all this. He who sees this, perceives this, and\nunderstands this, becomes an ativadin 3. If people say to such a man, Thou\n\np. 121\n\nart an ativadin, he may say, I am an ativadin; he need not deny it.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[120:1](sbe01149.htm#fr_316) Pra _n_ a is used here in a technical sense. It\ndoes not mean simply breath, but the spirit, the conscious self (pra _g_\n\xc3\xb1atman) which, as we saw, enters the body in order to reveal the whole variety\nof forms and names. It is in one sense the mukhya pra _n_ a.\n\n[120:2](sbe01149.htm#fr_317) The commentary carries the simile Still further.\nThe felloe he says, holds to the spokes, the spokes to the nave. So do the\nbhutamatras hold to the pra _g_ \xc3\xb1amatras, and these to the pra _n_ a.\n\n[120:3](sbe01149.htm#fr_318) One who declares something that goes beyond all\nthe declarations made before, beginning with the declaration that names are\nBrahman, and ending with the declaration that hope is Brahman;--one who knows\nthat pra _n_ a, spirit, the conscious self, is Brahman. This declaration\nrepresents the highest point reached by ordinary people, but Narada wishes to\ngo beyond. In the Mu _n_ _d_ aka, III, 1, 4, an ativadin is contrasted with\none who really knows the highest truth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 16](sbe01150.htm)\n\n"
