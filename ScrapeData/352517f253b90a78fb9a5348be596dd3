What is understood from all the Vedanta-texts (is one), on account of the\nnon-difference of injunction and the rest.\n\nThe Sutras have stated whatever has to be stated to the end of rousing the\ndesire of meditation-concluding with the fact that Brahman bestows rewards.\nNext the question is introduced whether the vidyas (i.e. the different forms\nof meditation on Brahman which the Vedanta-texts enjoin) are different or non-\ndifferent, on the decision of which question it will depend whether the\nqualities attributed to Brahman in those vidyas are to be comprised in one act\nof meditation or not.--The first subordinate question arising here is whether\none and the same meditation--as e.g. the vidya of Vai _s_ vanara--which is met\nwith in the text of several _s_ akhas, constitutes one vidya or several.--The\nvidyas are separate, the Purvapakshin maintains; for the fact that the same\nmatter is, without difference, imparted for a second time, and moreover stands\nunder a different heading--both which circumstances necessarily attend the\ntext's being met with in different _s_ akhas--proves the difference of the two\nmeditations. It is for this reason only that a restrictive injunction, such as\nthe one conveyed in the text, 'Let a man tell this science of Brahman to those\nonly who have performed the rite of carrying fire on their head' (Mu. Up. III,\n2, 10)--which restricts the impaiting of knowledge to the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas, to\nwhom that rite is peculiar--has any sense; for if the vidyas were one, then\nthe rite mentioned, which is a part of the vidya, would be valid for the\nmembers of other _s_ akhas also, and then the restriction enjoined by the text\nwould have no meaning.--This view is set aside by the Sutra, 'What is\nunderstood from all the Vedanta-texts' is one and the same meditation,\n'because there is non-difference of injunction and the rest.' By injunction is\nmeant the\n\np. 630\n\ninjunction of special activities denoted by different verbal roots--such as\nupasita 'he should meditate,' vidyat 'he should know.' The and the rest' of\nthe Sutra is meant to comprise as additional reasons the circumstances\nmentioned in the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras (II, 4, 9). Owing to all these\ncircumstances, non-difference of injunction and the rest, the same vidya is\nrecognised in other _s_ akhas also. In the _Kh_ aandogya (V, 12, 2) as well as\nin the Va _g_ asaneyaka we meet with one and the same injunction (viz. 'He\nshould meditate on Vai _s_ vanara'). The form (character, rupa) of the\nmeditations also is the same, for the form of a cognition solely depends on\nits object; and the object is in both cases the same, viz. Vai _s_ vanara. The\nname of the two vidyas also is the same, viz. the knowledge of Vai _s_ vanara.\nAnd both vidyas are declared to have the same result, viz. attaining to\nBrahman. All these reasons establish the identity of vidyas even in different\n_s_ akhas.--The next Sutra refers to the reasons set forth for his view by the\nPurvapakshin and refutes them.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
