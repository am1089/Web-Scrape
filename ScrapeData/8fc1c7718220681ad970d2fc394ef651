Or else the permission (of works) is for the glorification (of\nknowledge).\n\nThe passage 'Performing works here' may be treated in another way also. Even\nif, owing to the influence of the general subject-matter, only he who knows is\nto be viewed as he who performs works, yet the permission to perform works\nmust be viewed as aiming at the glorification of knowledge; as appears from\nthe subsequent clause, 'no work clings to the man.' The meaning of the entire\npassage thus is: To a man who knows no work will cling, should he perform\nworks during his whole life even, owing to the power of knowledge. And this\nclearly glorifies knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 15](sbe38224.htm)\n\n"
