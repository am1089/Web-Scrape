Let him speak only what refers to the due preparation of the food. With\nguests he may converse, if he likes.\n\n3\\. He then should take some portion of food which is fit for sacrifice,\nshould pour over it some liquid fit for sacrifice (such as ghee, milk, or\ncurds), and should sacrifice it silently in the fire with his hand.\n\n4\\. The first oblation is sacred to Pra _g_ apati, the second to (Agni) Svish\n_t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n5\\. He then should offer the Balis, inside or outside (the Agnyagara), having\nwell cleansed the ground.\n\n6\\. Let him pour out water once, and put down Balis in four places, and\nfinally sprinkle once (water on the four Balis).\n\n7\\. Or let him for each Bali which he puts down, sprinkle (water) before and\nafterwards.\n\n8\\. What he puts down first, that is the Bali belonging to the Earth. What in\nthe second place, to Vayu. What in the third place, to the Vi _s_ ve devas.\nWhat in the fourth place, to Pra _g_ apati.\n\n9. 9 Then he should offer other Balis (near) the water-pot, the middle (post, and) the door: the first Bali is sacred to the Waters, the second to the Herbs and Trees, the third to the Ether.\n\np. 23\n\n10\\. Then he should offer another Bali in the bed or in the privy. That Bali\nbelongs either to Kama or to Manyu.\n\n11. 11 Then (another Bali) on the heap of sweepings; that (belongs) to the hosts of Rakshas.\n\n12\\. The remnants of the Balis he should besprinkle with water, and should\npour them out towards the south from right to left; they belong to the\nFathers.\n\n13\\. Let him sacrifice in the fire sitting.\n\n14\\. Let him make the oblation to the Fathers sitting; the other (Balis he may\noffer) as it happens.\n\n15\\. He should, however, offer those Balis himself as long as he stays at\nhome.\n\n16\\. Or another person who must be a Brahma _n_ a (should offer them for him).\n\n17\\. Both the husband and his wife (should offer them):\n\n18\\. This is the rule for householders.\n\n19. 19 The wife in the evening, the man in the morning: thus (it is stated).\n\n20\\. He should offer such Balis of all food whatever, be it prepared for the\nFathers, or for auspicious\n\np. 24\n\npurposes (for instance, for being offered to Brahma _n_ as), or for (ordinary)\npurposes.\n\n21\\. Only in the case of a sacrifice (this rule) ceases.\n\n22. 22 If rice and barley are prepared for one and the same meal, he should, having offered (Balis) of the one or the other (kind of food), consider his duty as fulfilled.\n\n23. 23 If the food is cooked at different times for one meal, he should perform this Bali ceremony only once.\n\n24\\. If food is prepared at different places for one family, he should perform\nthis Bali ceremony only from (the food which is prepared in) the kitchen\nbelonging to the householder.\n\n25\\. However (of the persons belonging to the family) he whose food becomes\nready before (that of the householder), (that person) should offer the\nprescribed portion in the fire, and give to a Brahma _n_ a his share (of the\nfood), and then should eat himself.\n\n26\\. He whose (food becomes ready) after (that of the householder), should\nonly eat.\n\n27\\. Here they say also:\n\n28\\. 'At the end of that offering of Balis let him pronounce a wish. Then it\nwill be fulfilled to him.'\n\n29. 29 He himself, however, should offer the \xc3\x82sasya Bali, from the barley(-harvest) till the rice(-harvest), and from the rice(-harvest) till the barley(-harvest). This is called the \xc3\x82sasya Bali.\n\nThis Bali is called a-sasya, because it is offered until (a) the next crop\n(sasya) is ripe. As to the regulation that the sacrificer has to offer it\nhimself, compare above, Sutras 15-19.\n\np. 25\n\n30\\. Thus he obtains long life.\n\n31. 31 When a donation has been made, he should offer a Bali of chaff, of the scum of boiled rice, and of water. This is sacred to Rudra. This is sacred to Rudra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[22:1](sbe30007.htm#fr_126) 4, 1 seqq. The daily Bali offering. Khadira-G _ri_\nhya I, 5, 20 seqq.\n\n[22:9](sbe30007.htm#fr_127) According to the commentary the first of these\nthree Balis has p. 23 to be offered near the water-pot, the second near the\nmiddle door of the house, the third (comp. Gautama V, 16) in the air. With the\ngenitives the word samipe is supplied. It is difficult to understand why the\nauthor, if his intention had been to state three places in which the Balis had\nto be offered, should have mentioned only two. Thus I believe that the right\nexplanation is that-of Professor Knauer, who takes madhyama in the sense of\nthe middle post of the house (comp. III, 3, 31).\n\n[23:11](sbe30007.htm#fr_128) The commentary explains avasalavi nere, as is\nfrequently the case, by pit _ri_ tirthena. I agree with the opinion pronounced\nin the Petersburg Dictionary, in rejecting this explanation.\n\n[23:19](sbe30007.htm#fr_129) Comp.

The barley-harvest\nis in the hot season, the rice-harvest in autumn (see Zimmer, Altindisches\nLeben, 243). The sacrificer offers barley from the barley-harvest till the\nrice-harvest; and rice from the rice-harvest till the barley-harvest. [fp. 25\n\n[25:31](sbe30007.htm#fr_133) Khadira-G _ri_ hya I, 5, 30. The repetition of\nthe last words makes it probable that this Sutra was at one time considered\nthe end of the first book. Comp.
