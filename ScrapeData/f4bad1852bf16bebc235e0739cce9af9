[1882], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n2:4:1\n\n### FOURTH ADHY\xc3\x82YA. FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n2:4:1:11\\. Now after the performance of the Agnihotra he (optionally 2)\n.approaches the fires with (Va _g_. S. III, 37), 'Earth! ether! sky!' In\nsaying 'Earth! ether! sky!' he renders his speech auspicious by means of the\ntruth, and with that (speech) thus rendered propitious he invokes a\nblessing:--'May I be well supplied with offspring!' whereby he prays for\noffspring; '--well supplied with men!' whereby he prays for men (heroes); '--\nwell supplied with viands!' whereby he prays for prosperity.\n\n2:4:1:22\\. That long (form of) fire-worship is a prayer for blessing, and so\nis this (short) one a prayer for blessing: hence even with this much he\nobtains all, and he may therefore worship the fires with it. 'Therewith,\nindeed, we perform,' so spake \xc3\x82suri.\n\n2:4:1:33\\. Now, when he is about to set out on a journey 3, he approaches\nfirst the Garhapatya, and thereupon the \xc3\x82havaniya.\n\np. 358\n\n2:4:1:44\\. The Garhapatya he approaches with the text (Va _g_. S. III, 37 b\nseq.), 'Thou, that art friendly to man, protect my offspring!' He (Agni\nGarhapatya), truly, is the guardian of offspring; and therefore he now makes\nover to him his offspring for protection.\n\n2:4:1:55\\. He then approaches the \xc3\x82havaniya, with 'Thou, that art worthy of\npraise, protect my cattle!' He (Agni), truly, is the guardian of cattle, and\ntherefore he now makes over to him his cattle for protection 1.\n\n2:4:1:66\\. Thereupon he walks or drives off; and having got as far as what he\nconsiders to be the boundary 2, he breaks silence. And when he returns from\nhis journey he maintains silence from the moment he sees what he considers to\nbe the boundary. And even though there be a king inside (one's house), one\nmust not go to him (or any other person before one has rendered homage to the\nfires).\n\n2:4:1:77\\. He first approaches the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, and thereupon the\nGarhapatya. The Garhapatya doubtless is a house (g _ri_ ha _h_ ), and a house\nis a safe resting-place: so that he thereby (finally 3) establishes himself in\na house, that is, in a safe resting-place.\n\n2:4:1:88\\. He approaches the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, with the text (Va _g_. S. III, 38\nseq.), 'We have approached (thee), the all-knowing, the most liberal dispenser\nof\n\np. 359\n\ngoods: O Agni, sovereign lord, bestow on us lustre and strength!' Having then\nsat down he sweeps the blades of grass 1 (into the fire).\n\n2:4:1:99\\. Thereupon he approaches the Garhapatya, with the text, 'He, Agni\nGarhapatya, is the lord of the house, the most liberal dispenser of goods to\nour offspring: O Agni, lord of the house, bestow on us lustre and strength!'\nHaving then sat down, he sweeps off the blades of grass. In this way\n(householders) mostly approach the fires with muttered prayer.\n\n2:4:1:1010\\. However, one may also approach the fires silently,--and that for\nthis reason:--If in the place (where one lives), a Brahman or noble--in short,\na better man--resides, one dares not say to him, 'I am going on a journey,\ntake care of this (property) of mine 2!' Now in this (sacrificial ground)\none's betters indeed reside, viz. the divine Agnis: who, then, would dare to\nsay to them, 'I am going on a journey, take ye care of this (property) of\nmine!'\n\n2:4:1:1111\\. The gods assuredly see through the mind of man: that (Agni)\nGarhapatya therefore knows that he (the householder) now approaches in order\nto give\n\np. 360\n\nhimself up to him. Silently he approaches the \xc3\x82havaniya fire: that (Agni)\n\xc3\x82havaniya knows that he now approaches in order to give himself up to him.\n\n2:4:1:1212\\. Thereupon he walks or drives off; and having got as far as what\nhe considers the boundary line, he releases his speech. And when he returns\nfrom the journey, he maintains silence from the moment he sees what he\nconsiders to be the boundary. And even though there be a king inside (one's\nhouse), one must not go to him.\n\n2:4:1:1313\\. He first approaches the \xc3\x82havaniya, and thereupon the Garhapatya.\nSilently he approaches the \xc3\x82havaniya; and silently he sits down and sweeps\naway the grass-blades. Silently he approaches the Garhapatya; and silently he\nsits down and sweeps away the grass-blades.\n\n2:4:1:1414\\. Then as to the observances in regard to (the entering of) his\nhouse. Now when a householder comes home from a journey, his house trembles\ngreatly for fear of him, thinking, 'What will he say here? what will he do\nhere?' It is therefore for fear of him that speaks or does anything on this\noccasion that the house trembles and is liable to crush his family; but him\nwho neither speaks nor does anything, his house receives with confidence,\nthinking, 'He has not spoken here, he has not done anything here!' And should\nhe be ever so angry at anything on this occasion, let him rather do on the\nnext day whatever he might wish to say or do. This then is the observance in\nregard to the house 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[357:1](sbe1251.htm#fr_791) See I, 9, 3, 21\n\n[357:2](sbe1252.htm#fr_792) For this shorter form of worshipping the fires,\nsee [p. 349](sbe1251.htm#page_349), note [2](sbe1251.htm#fn_781).\n\n[357:3](sbe1252.htm#fr_793) That is, a journey which will compel him to pass\nthe night beyond the village boundary.\n\n[358:1](sbe1252.htm#fr_794) The Va _g_. S. gives also the formulas with which\nthe Dakshi _n_ agni should be approached, after the other two fires, by the\nhouseholder, both in starting on, and returning from, his journey. See Katy.\nIV, 12, 13; 18. The Ka _n_ va text does not allude to the Dakshi _n_ a fire\nany more than ours.\n\n[358:2](sbe1252.htm#fr_795) According to the Paddhati on Katy. IV, 12, he has\nto maintain silence as long as he can see the roof of one of his fire-houses;\nbut according to the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana _s_ akha he has to do so only as long as he\ncan see one of the fires.\n\n[358:3](sbe1252.htm#fr_796) The Ka _n_ va text reads 'antata _h_.'\n\n[359:1](sbe1252.htm#fr_797) According to Katy. IV, 12, 18-19 he [after\nperforming ablutions, and lustrating the \xc3\x82havaniya and Dakshi _n_ a fire-\nplaces, and taking out these fires from the Garhapatya] approaches the\n\xc3\x82havaniya, while holding pieces of fire-wood in his hand, and mutters the\nformula given above. He then sits down and silently puts on the fire a piece\nof wood and the grass that has fallen around the fire. According to the Ka _n_\nva text he mutters the second half of the formula ('O Agni,' &c.) while\nsweeping the grass (into the fire).\n\n[359:2](sbe1252.htm#fr_798) In Taitt. Br. I, 1, 10, 6, a householder who is\nabout to start on a journey is apparently recommended to entrust his house to\na Brahman, who may be staying in it.\n\n[360:1](sbe1252.htm#fr_799) The Ka _n_ va text here adds the formulas Va _g_.\nS. III, 41-43, lines 1 and 2, wherewith he approaches (upatish _th_ ate) the\nhouse. See Katy. IV, 12, 22. According to Katy. ib. 23, he then enters p. 361\nthe house with the formula Va _g_. S. III, 43, line 3, 'For safety, for peace\nI resort to thee: be there kindliness, happiness, all-hail, and blessing!'\nThereupon, according to the Schol., he is to proceed in accordance with the\nrules laid down in the G _ri_ hya-sutras; cf. Parask. G. I, 18; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G. I,\n15, 9.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe1253.htm)\n\n"
