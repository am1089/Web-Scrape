'As the bees 1, my son, make honey by collecting the juices of distant\ntrees, and reduce the juice into one form,\n\n2\\. 'And as these juices have no discrimination, so that they might say, I am\nthe juice of this tree or that, in the same manner, my son, all these\ncreatures, when they have become merged in the True (either in deep sleep or\nin death), know not that they are merged in the True.\n\n3\\. 'Whatever these creatures are here, whether a lion, or a wolf, or a boar,\nor a worm, or a midge, or a gnat, or a musquito, that they become again and\nagain.\n\n4\\. 'Now that which is that subtile essence, in it all that exists has its\nself. It is the True. It is the Self, and thou, O _S_ vetaketu, art it.'\n\n'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.\n\n'Be it so, my child,' the father replied.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[101:1](sbe01127.htm#fr_289) At the beginning of each chapter the commentator\nsupplies the question which the son is supposed to have asked his father. The\nfirst is: All creatures falling every day into deep sleep (sushupti) obtain\nthereby the Sat, the true being. How is it then that they do not know that\nthey obtain the Sat every day?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 10](sbe01128.htm)\n\n"
