Prayer for sovereign power addressed to the god Rohita and his\nfemale Rohini.\n\n1\\. Rise up, O steed, that art within the waters, enter this kingdom, rich in\nliberal gifts! Rohita (the red sun) who has begotten this all, shall keep thee\nwell-supported for sovereignty!  \n2\\. The steed that is within the waters has risen up: ascend upon the clans\nthat are sprung from thee! Furnishing soma, the waters, plants, and cows,\ncause thou four-footed and two-footed creatures to enter here!  \n3\\. Do ye, strong Maruts, children of Prisni (the cloud), allied with Indra,\ncrush the enemies! Rohita shall hear you, that give abundant gifts, the thrice\nseven Maruts, who take delight in sweet (nourishment)!  \n4\\. Rohita has climbed the heights, he has ascended them, he, the embryo of\nwomen, (has ascended) the womb of births. Closely united with these women they\nfound out the six broad (directions); spying out a road he has brought hither\nsovereignty.  \n5\\. Hither to thee Rohita has brought sovereignty; he has dispersed the\nenemies: freedom from danger has resulted for thee. To thee heaven and earth\ntogether with the revati and sakvari-stanzas shall yield gifts at will!  \n6\\. Rohita produced heaven and earth; there Parameshthin (the lord on high)\nextended the thread (of the sacrifice). There Aga Ekapada (the one-footed\ngoat, the sun) did fix himself; he made firm the heavens and earth with his\nstrength.  \n7\\. Rohita made firm heaven and earth, by him the (heavenly) light was\nestablished, by him the firmament. By him the atmosphere and the spaces were\nmeasured out, through him the gods obtained immortality.  \n8\\. Rohita did ponder the multiform (universe) while preparing (his) climbings\nand advances. Having ascended the heaven with great might, he shall anoint thy\nroyalty with milk and ghee!  \n9\\. All thy climbings, advances, and all thy ascents with which thou, (Rohita,\nthe sun), fillest the heavens and the atmosphere, having strengthened thyself\nwith their brahma and payas (spiritual and physical essence) do thou keep\nawake (do thou watch over) among the people in the kingdom of the (earthly)\nRohita (the king)!  \n10\\. The peoples that have originated from thy tapas (heat, or creative\nfervour), have followed here the calf, the gayatri. They shall enter thee with\nkindly spirit; the calf Rohita with its mother shall come on!  \n11\\. High on the firmament Rohita has stood, a youth, a sage, begettinu all\nforms. As Agni he shines with piercing light, in the third space he did assume\nlovely (forms).  \n12\\. A bull with a thousand horns, Gatavedas (fire), endowed with sacrifices\nof ghee, carrying soma upon his back, rich in heroes, he shall, when implored,\nnot abandon me, nor may I abandon thee: abundance in cattle and abundance in\nheroes procure for me!  \n14\\. Rohita is the generator of the sacrifice, and its mouth; to Rohita I\noffer oblations with voice, ear, and mind. To Rohita the gods resort with glad\nmind: he shall cause me to rise through elevation derived from the assembly!  \n14\\. Rohita arranged a sacrifice for Visvakarman; from it these brilliant,\nqualities have come to me. Let me announce thy origin over the extent of the\nworld!  \n15, Upon thee have ascended the brihati and the pankti (metres), upon thee the\nkakubh with splendour, O Gatavedas. Upon thee the vashat-call, whose syllables\nmake an ushniha, has ascended, upon thee Rohita with his seed has ascended.  \n16\\. This one clothes himself in the womb of the earth, this one clothes\nhimself in heaven, and in the atmosphere. This one at the station of the brown\n(sun) did attain unto the worlds of light.  \n17\\. O Vakaspati (lord of speech), the earth shall be pleasant to us, pleasant\nour dwelling, agrecable our couches! Right here life's breath shall be to our\nfriend; thee, O Parameshthin, Agni shall envelop in life and lustre!  \n18\\. O Vakaspati, the five seasons that we have, which have come about as the\ncreation of Visvakarman, rialit here (they and) life's breath shall be to our\nfriend; thee, O Parameshthin, Rohita shall envelop in life and lustre!  \n19\\. O Vakaspati, good cheer and spirit, cattle in our stable, children in our\nwombs beget thou! Right here life's breath shall be to our friend; thee, O\nParameshthin, I envelop in life and lustre.  \n20\\. God Savitar and Agni shall envelop thee, Mitra and Varuna surround thee\nwith lustre! Treading down all powers of grudge come thou hither: thou hast\nmade this kingdom rich in liberal gifts.  \n21\\. Thou, O Rohita, whom the brindled cow, harnessed at the side, carries,\ngoest with brilliance, causing the waters to flow.  \n22\\. Devoted to Rohita is Rohini his mistress, with beautiful colour\n(complexion), great, and lustrous: through her may we conquer booty of every\ndescription, through her win every battle!  \n23\\. This seat, Rohini, belongs to Rohita; yonder is the path on which the\nbrindled (female) goes! Her the Gandharvas and the Kasyapas lead forth, her\nthe sages guard with diligence.  \n24\\. The radiant bay steeds of the sun, the immortal, ever draw the delightful\nchariot. Rohita, the drinker of ghee, the shining god, did enter the\nvariegated heavens.  \n25\\. Rohita, the sharp-horned bull, who surpasses Agni and surpasses Surya,\nwho props up the earth and the sky, out of him the gods frame the creations.  \n26\\. Rohita ascended the heaven from the great flood; Rohita has climbed all\nheights.  \n27\\. Create (the cow) that is rich in milk, drips with ghee: she is the milch-\ncowof the gods that does not refuse! Indra shall drink the Soma, there shall\nbe secure possession; Agni shall sing praises: the enemies do thou drive out!  \n28\\. Agni kindled, spreads his flames, fortified by ghee, sprinkled with ghee.\nVictorious, all-conquering Agni shall slay them that are my rivals!  \n29\\. He shall slay them, shall burn the enemy that battles against us! With\nthe flesh-devouring Agni do we burn our rivals.  \n30\\. Smite them down, O Indra, with the thunderbolt, with thy (strong) arm!\nThen have I overpowered my rivals with Agni's brilliant strengths.  \n31\\. O Agni, subject our rivals to us; confuse, O Brihaspati, the kinsman that\nis puffed up! O Indra and Agni, O Mitra and Varuna, subjected they shall be,\nunable to vent their wrath against us!  \n32\\. Do thou, god Surya (the sun), when thou risest, beat down my rivals, beat\nthem down with a stone: they shall go to the nethermost darkness!  \n33\\. The calf of Virag, the bull of prayers, carrying the bright (soma) upon\nhis back, has ascended the atmosphere. A song accompanied by ghee they sing to\nthe calf; himself brahma (spiritual exaltation) they swell him with their\nbrahma (prayer).  \n34\\. Ascend the heavens, ascend the earth sovereignty ascend thou, and\npossessions ascend thou! Offspring ascend thou, and immortality ascend thou,\nunite thy body with Rohita!  \n35\\. The gods that hold sovereignty, who go about the sun, with these allied,\nRohita, kindly disposed, shall bestow sovereignty upon thee!  \n36\\. The sacrifices purified by prayer lead thee forth; the bay steeds that\ntravel upon the road carry thee: thou shinest across the swelling ocean.  \n37\\. In Rohita who conquers wealth, conquers cattle, and conquers booty,\nheaven and earth are fixed. Of thee that hast a thousand and seven births, let\nme announce the origin over the extent of the world!  \n38\\. Glorious thou goest to the intermediate directions and the directions (of\nspace), glorious (in the sight) of animals and the tribes of men, glorious in\nthe lap of the earth, of Aditi: may I like Savitar be lovely!  \n39\\. Being yonder thou knowest (what takes place) here; being here thou\nbeholdest these things. Here (men) behold the inspired sun that shines upon\nthe sky.  \n40\\. A god thou praisest the gods, thou movest within the flood. They kindle\n(him), a universal fire; him the highest sages know.  \n41\\. Below the superior (region), above the inferior (region) here, the cow\nhas arisen supporting (her) calf by the foot. Whither is she turned; to which\nhalf (of the universe), forsooth, has she aone away; where, forsooth, does she\nbeget? Verily not in this herd!  \n42\\. One-footed, two-footed, four-footed is she; eight-footed, nine-footed\nbecame she, the thousand-syllabled (consisting of thousand elements) pankti\n(quinary stanza) of the universe: the oceans from her flow forth upon (the\nworld).  \n43\\. Ascending the heaven, immortal, receive kindly my song! The sacrifices\npurified by prayer lead thee forth; the bay steeds that travel upon the road\ncarry thee.  \n44\\. That do I know of thee, O immortal, where thy march is upon the sky,\nwhere thy habitation is in the highest heaven.  \n45\\. Surya (the sun) surveys the sky, Surya the earth, Surya the waters. Surya\nis the single eye of being: he has ascended the great heavens.  \n46\\. The broad (directions) where the fagots that fence in (the fire), the\nearth turned itself into a fire-altar. There Rohita laid on for himself these\ntwo fires, cold and heat.  \n47\\. Laying on cold and heat, using the mountains as sacrificial posts, the\ntwo fires of Rohita who knows the (heavenly) light, into which (the fires)\nrain (flowed) as ghee, carried out the sacrifice.  \n48\\. The fire of Rohita who knows the (heavenly) light is kindled by prayer.\nFrom it heat, from it cold, from it the sacrifice was produced.  \n49\\. The two fires swelling through prayer, increased through prayer,\nsacrificed into with prayer; the two fires of Rohita who knows the (heavenly)\nlight, kindled through prayer, carried out the sacrifice.  \n50\\. One is deposited in truth, the other is kindled in the waters. The two\nfires of Rohita who knows the (heavenly) light, kindled through prayer,\ncarried out the sacrifice.  \n51\\. The fire which the wind brightens up, and that which Indra and\nBrahmanaspati (brighten up), the two fires of Rohita who knows the (heavenly)\nlight, kindled through prayer, carried out the sacrifice.  \n52\\. Having fashioned the earth into an altar, having made the heavens (his)\nsacrificial reward, then having made heat into fire, Rohita created all that\nhas breath through rain (serving) as ghee.  \n53\\. Rain fashioned itself into ghee, heat into fire, the earth into an altar.\nThen Agni by (his) songs fashioned the high mountains.  \n54\\. Having fashioned by means of songs the high (mountains), Rohita spake to\nthe earth: In thee all shall be born, what is and what shall be.  \n55\\. The sacrifice first, (and then) what is and what shall be was born. From\nthat this all was born, and whatever here appears, brought hither by the sage\nRohita.  \n56\\. He who kicks a cow with his foot, and he who micturates towards the sun--\nof thee do I tear out the root; thou shalt henceforth not cast a shadow!  \n57\\. Thou that passest across me, casting thy shadow against me, between me\nand the fire--of thee do I tear out the root; thou shalt henceforth not cast a\nshadow!  \n58\\. He, O god Surya, that to-day passes between thee and me, upon him our\nevil dream, our foulness, and our misfortunes do we wipe off.  \n59\\. May we not miss our way, may we not, O Indra, miss the sacrifice of him\nthat presses the soma; may.not the powers of grudge intercept us!  \n60\\. The (guiding) thread stretched out among the gods, that accomplishes the\nsacrifice, that, by pouring oblations, may we attain!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 5.
