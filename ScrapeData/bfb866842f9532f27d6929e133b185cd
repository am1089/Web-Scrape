XVI.\n\nInquiries of Maitreya respecting the history of Prahlada.\n\nMAITREYA.--Venerable Muni, you have described to me the races of human beings,\nand the eternal Vishn\xcc\x81u, the cause of this world; but who was this mighty\nPrahlada, of whom you have last spoken; whom fire could not burn; who died\nnot, when pierced by weapons; at whose presence in the waters earth trembled,\nshaken by his movements, even though in bonds; and who, overwhelmed with\nrocks, remained unhurt. I am desirous to hear an account of the unequalled\nmight of that sage worshipper of Vishn\xcc\x81u, to whose marvellous history you have\nalluded. Why was he assailed by the weapons of the sons of Diti? why was so\nrighteous a person thrown into the sea? wherefore was he overwhelmed with\nrocks? why bitten by venomous snakes? why hurled from the mountain crest? why\ncast into the flames? why was he made a mark for the tusks of the elephants of\nthe spheres? wherefore was the blast of death directed against him by the\nenemies of the gods? why did the priests of the Daityas practise ceremonies\nfor his destruction? why were the thousand illusions of Samvara exercised upon\nhim? and for what purpose was deadly poison administered to him by the\nservants of the king, but which was innocuous as food to his sagacious son?\nAll this I am anxious to hear: the history of the magnanimous Prahlada; a\nlegend of great marvels. Not that it is a wonder that he should have been\nuninjured by the Daityas; for who can injure the man that fixes his whole\nheart on Vishn\xcc\x81u? but it is strange that such inveterate hatred should have\nbeen shewn, by his own kin, to one so virtuous, so unweariedly occupied in\nworshipping Vishn\xcc\x81u. You can explain to me for what reason the sons of Diti\noffered violence to one so pious, so illustrious, so attached to Vishn\xcc\x81u, so\nfree from guile. Generous enemies wage no war with such as he was, full of\nsanctity and every excellence; how should his own father thus behave towards\nhim? Tell me therefore, most illustrious Muni, the whole story in detail: I\nwish to hear the entire narrative of the sovereign of the Daitya race.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVII](vp052.htm)\n\n'
