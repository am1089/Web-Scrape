Vyasa said :-- O king Janamejaya! Prahlada was glad to hear the above\nwords of the high souled Bhargava.\n\n\n\n2\\. Knowing Fate to be the strongest, he addressed the Daityas :-- Never, in\nthis battle will victory be ours.\n\n\n\n3-5. Then the victorious Demons, infatuated with pride, told Prahlada :-- What\nis Fate? We do not recognise it. We ought to fight. O Lord of us :-- Fate\nreigns over those that are idle, not energetic. Has Fate any shape? Who has\ncreated it? Has anybody seen Fate? However let us gather strength and fight.\nYou are very intelligent and all knowing; It is proper that you should take\nour lead in the fight.\n\n\n\n6\\. O king! When the Daityas spoke thus, Prahlada, the great Destroyer of\nenemies, became the general and challenged the Devas to fight.\n\n\n\n7\\. On seeing the Asuras in the battle field, the Devas, dressed with arms and\nweapons, began to fight with them.\n\n\n\n8\\. For full one hundred years the dreadful battle was fought between Indra\nand Prahlada; on seeing this, the Munis were astonished.\n\n\n\n9\\. O king! In this fearful battle, the Daityas with their general Prahlada,\nthe followers of S\xc2\x92ukracharya, got the victory.\n\n\n\n10\\. Then Indra, advised by their Guru Brihaspati, began to remember the\nGoddess of the Universe, the Most High, the Giver of welfare, the Destroyer of\nall sorrows and calamities, and the Bestower of freedom, worship Her, and sing\nhymns to Her with great devotion.\n\n\n\n11-12. Indra said :-- Victory be to the name of the Goddess Mahamaya, the\nEternal Mother, the Holder of the trident! Holder of conchshell, disc, club,\nand lotus, the Giver of \xc2\x93no fear.\xc2\x94 Salutation to Thee, the Goddess of the\nUniverse; Thou art the Supreme Heroine in everything that relates to force,\nthat is described in the S\xc2\x92akti Dars\xc2\x92ana S\xc2\x92astras. Thou art the Ten Tattvas,\nThou art the Mother, Thou art the Mahavidya (the Supreme Knowledge).\n\n\n\np. 304\n\n\n\n13\\. There are many Tattvas; here the ten tattvas are according to the S\xc2\x92akti\nDars\xc2\x92ana. There are many Dharma S\xc2\x92astras. Here S\xc2\x92akti S\xc2\x92astra is meant.\n\n\n\nThe Tattvas are those ultimate substances into which these gross\nmanifestations resolve. The tattvas are Mahavindu, Nada S\xc2\x92akti, Mis'ra Vindu,\netc.\n\n\n\nO World Mother! Thou art the Maha Kundalini (the great Serpent Fire); thou art\nthe Everlasting Existence, Intelligence and Bliss; Thou art the Deity of the\nvital Fire (Pra _n_ a); Thou art the Deity of the Agnihotra (maintenance of\nthe Sacred Fire and an oblation to It); Thou art the Holy Flame, burning\nalways in the ethereal space in the Heart; Salutation to Thee!\n\n\n\n14\\. Thou dwellest within the five Sheaths (the Annamaya, the Pra _n_ amaya,\nthe Manomaya, the Vij\xc3\xb1anamaya and the \xc3\x82nandamaya sheaths are the five sheaths\nhere referred to). Thou art the Indweller of the \xc3\x82nanda maya kosa, Thou art of\nthe nature of Puchchha Brahma, the end of Brahma. Thou art the Deity of all,\nthe \xc3\x82nanda (bliss) unblown, O Mother! Thou art the Deity of all the Upani _s_\nadas.\n\n\n\n15\\. O Mother! Be pleased unto us; we have become powerless; protect us, O\nMother! we are defeated by the Daityas; O Goddess! Thou art endowed with all\nthe powers, Thou art our Sole Refuge in this Universe, in times of distress,\nand Thou art the Only One, strong and capable to remove all our dangers.\n\n\n\n16\\. O Goddess! Those who incessantly meditate on Thee are really happy and\nthose that do not meditate Thee, their fear, and sorrows are never removed;\nthose that want ultimate freedom from bondage and who meditate on Thee always;\nthose pure souls, being free from Ahamkara, and free from attachment go, no\ndoubt, beyond this ocean of world.\n\n\n\n17\\. O World Mother! Thy prowess is ever manifested whenever protection is\ndemanded; You always come forward and relieve the distressed; You are the\ngreat destroyer! Thou art the Time Incarnate of all these worlds; O Mother! We\nare fools; how can we appreciate your qualities.\n\n18\\. Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes\xc2\x92a, I myself, Sun, Yama, Varuna, Fire, Air, the\nhigh minded munis, \xc3\x82gama, Nigama, the Tantras and the Vedas, are quite unable\nto realise Your unequalled prowess; Salutation to Thy Feet.\n\n\n\n19\\. Those are blessed that are devoted to Thee; They are the great souls;\nthey always dive in the Ocean of Bliss, being always free from the fangs of\nthis Samsara. Those that are not Your devotees, cannot cross this Ocean of\nSamsara, where the Birth and Death are the billows.\n\n\n\n20\\. O Goddess! Those that are always fanned by the white chamaras and those\nthat travel always in cars, they in their previous births worshipped Thee with\nvarious things; therefore they have acquired the effects of their meritorious\ndeeds; this is my opinion.\n\n\n\np. 305\n\n\n\n21\\. Those that are always worshipped amongst the human beings, those that go\non nice elephants, those that are surrounded by pleasures and enjoy the lovely\ncompanions of beautiful coquettish women, those that go surrounded by\nsoldiers, O Goddess! I consider they worshipped Thee in their previous births,\nand they are now enjoying fruits of their past deeds.\n\n\n\n22-23. Vyasa said :-- Thus praised by Indra, the Goddess of the Universe with\nfour arms hurriedly appeared there mounted on a lion. Conchshell, disc, club,\nand lotuses were held by the beautiful eyed Goddess in Her four hands\nrespectively, wearing a red apparel and ornamented with divine garlands.\n\n\n\n24\\. The Goddess being pleased addressed the Devas with sweet words, \xc2\x93Cast off\nyour fear. O Devas! I will see presently all about your welfare.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n25\\. Addressing the Devas thus, the Divine Mother mounted on a lion, went\nhurriedly to the place where the demons were waiting, infatuated with pride.\n\n\n\n26\\. All the Daityas with their general Prahlada saw the Goddess before them\nand were terrified and began to address each other \xc2\x93What are we to do now?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n27-28. This Chandika Goddess has come here to protect the Devas. She destroyed\nMahi _s_ asura and Chan _d_ a Mun _d_ a; it was She that killed, in days of\nyore, Madhukai _t_ ava with evil look.\n\n\n\n29-30. Seeing the demons thus full of sorrowful thoughts, Prahlada addressed\nthe Daityas :-- \xc2\x93It is better not to fight but let us fly away all together.\xc2\x94\nThen the Daitya Namuchi told the Daityas ready to fly away \xc2\x93If you fly away,\nthis World Mother will instantly kill you all with weapons in Her hands.\n\n\n\n31\\. Do that by which we can protect us. Let us worship the Goddess of the\nUniverse, and, getting Her permission, we will go this very day to the\nPatala.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n32\\. Prahlada said \xc2\x93I will worship the Goddess Mahamaya, the Creatrix,\nPreservrix and Destructrix of the Universe, the World Mother, and the Assurer\nof safety to Her devotees.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n33\\. Vyasa said :-- Thus saying, the knower of the highest knowledge,\nPrahlada, the devotee of Vi _sn_ u, began to sing hymns with folded hands in\npraise of the Goddess, the Upholdress of the Universe.\n\n\n\n34\\. I bow down to Thee, the incarnate of the mantra \xc2\x93Hrim\xc2\x94 the Refuge of all,\nand within Whom this whole Universe, moving and unmoving, is appearing untruly\nas a snake is mistaken for a garland of flowers.\n\n\n\np. 306\n\n\n\n35\\. O Goddess! All these Universes, moving and unmoving, have sprung from\nThee; Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and others are Creators, Preservers in name only; Thou\nhast created them all.\n\n\n\n36\\. O Mahamaya! You are the Divine Mother of all! When You have created the\nAsuras and the Suras, how can you then see any difference between the Devas\nand the Daityas?\n\n\n\n37\\. As a Mother makes no distinction between her good sons and bad sons, so\nYou are not to make any difference between us and the Devas; this is our\nprayer to you.\n\n\n\n38\\. O Goddess! You have been sung in all the Pura _n_ as as the World Mother;\ntherefore, O Mother! We are your sons just as the Devas are.\n\n\n\n39\\. O Mother! As they have got their interests, so we too have got our\ninterests; therefore there is no difference between he Daityas and the Devas.\nTherefore if anyone makes any difference, it is due to the subtle error.\n\n\n\n40\\. O Goddess! As we are attached to wealth, wives, and other pleasures of\nthe senses, so the gods are; O Goddess! How then can any difference exist\nbetween them and us.\n\n\n\n41\\. O Mother! They are the sons of Mahar _s_ i Kas\xc2\x92yapa; we also are his\nsons; Therefore you cannot have partiality for them before us.\n\n\n\n42\\. O World Mother! In You no such difference is visible anywhere. Therefore\ndo You here preserve equality amongst us both.\n\n\n\n43\\. The Suras and Asuras all have sprung from the permutations and\ncombinations of the 3 qualities! Then how the Devas being embodied can possess\nmore qualities than us.\n\n\n\n44\\. Every embodied soul possesses always cupidity, anger, covetousness; how\nthen can one expect to remain without any quarrels with others.\n\n\n\n45\\. We think that it is all sport with You to see our opinions different,\nrather contradictory, and it is You who got us involved in quarrels with each\nother and it is Your pleasure to witness how we fight against each other.\n\n\n\n46\\. Sinless one! O Chamunde! Were You not so fond to see our fight, how then,\nwe being brothers are at war against each other. Certainly it is Your Divine\nSport.\n\n\n\n47\\. O Goddess! I know what is religion, I know who is Indra. It is the very\nidea to enjoy these sensual pleasures that is the only cause of our incessant\nquarrels.\n\n\n\np. 307\n\n\n\n48\\. O Mother! You are the Sole Ruler of this Samsara; no sensible man can\ncarry out the words of a man who yearns for something. (i.e., O Mother, You\nare the only one that is desireless; so we can obey your words).\n\n\n\n49\\. O Mother! Once the Devas and the Asuras conjointly churned the ocean. At\nthat time Vi _sn_ u, on the plea of distributing the jewel, and the ambrosial\nnectar, incurred quarrels amongst them.\n\n\n\n50\\. O Mother! You have made him the Preserver and Controller of the Universe\nand the Spiritual Guide of the world. And it was He who took away the Goddess\nLak _s_ mi, the beautiful lady amongst the Deva women.\n\n\n\n51\\. Indra, the Lord of the Gods, took the elephant named Airavat, the flower\nParijat, the Heavenly Cow yielding all desires, and the horse Uchchais\xc2\x92rava.\nThus, through the desires and devices of Vi _sn_ u, they got the excellent\nthings.\n\n\n\n52\\. O! What a wonder is this that the Devas were considered holy persons,\nafter they had committed such unholy acts; no doubt the Devas had done a very\nheinous crime. O Goddess! You can judge Yourself what is the just and unjust\nthing in this case.\n\n\n\n53\\. What is Religion? And where is Religion? And what are the acts done by a\nreligious man? What is uprightness, justice, and purity? You better examine\nwhich party has observed virtue? Who has shown uprightness, justice and\nparity? To whom victory and defeat are due? You are the only one capable to\njudge all these things.\n\n\n\n54-55. Alas! Whom to tell all the conclusions arrived at in the Mimamsakas. If\nany one considers, one will find the world is the field of dissensions and\nquarrels; the argumentators look to the logical reasoning only; followers of\nthe Vedas look to the rules and regulations only; these so called men of gross\nideas they acknowledge that this world is created and preserved by the One\nonly, and yet they quarrel amongst each other.\n\n\n\n56-57. If there be One and only One Lord of this wide infinite Samsara, then\nwhy would there be differences and quarrels amongst each other? Why is there\nnot seen any agreement in opinion and why do the S\xc2\x92astras differ and why are\nthere so many differences in the opinions held by the knowers of the Vedas.\n\n\n\n58\\. O Goddess! This whole Universe, moving and unmoving is selfish; hence\narise so many differences between several opinions. There was no one unselfish\nin this world and there would be no unselfish persons born hereafter.\n\n\n\np. 308\n\n\n\n59-64. Look! The Moon stole away perforce knowingly the wife of Brihaspati;\nIndra, knowing what is religion stole away the wife of Gautama; Brihaspati\nenjoyed forcibly the wife of his younger; and also he outraged his elder\nbrother\xc2\x92s wife in her pregnant state and cursed the boy in the womb and\n\nmade him blind. What more to say than Vi _sn_ u, all full of Sattvic\nqualities, severed perforce the head of Rahu. O Mother! Look to the case of my\ngrandson Bali who used to pay due respects to all, who was the foremost\namongst the virtuous, observer of rigorous truth, performer of sacrifices,\nliberal, peaceful, all-knowing. The pretender Hari, taking the form of a dwarf\nin his Vamana incarnation, deceived Bali and took away all his kingdoms. Alas!\nStill the intelligent good persons reckon the Deva Vi _sn_ u as the preserver\nof Religion. What a wonder! Those who are flatterers become victorious in this\nworld; and defeat come to those that speak of Dharma.\n\n\n\n65\\. O Goddess! You are the Mother of all the worlds; do whatever You like.\nBut You should know that the Demons are all under Your protection; kill or\nsave them as You like.\n\n\n\n66\\. The Devi said :-- O Demons! Leave you all the anger arising from this\nwarfare and go without any fear to Patala and live there at your ease and\nhappiness.\n\n\n\n67\\. Better now wait on Time; whether you will get auspicious or inauspicious\nfruits for your deeds. Know whoever is desireless and unattached, to him\nhappiness is always and everywhere.\n\n\n\n68\\. Whose mind is avaricious, He does not get peace and happiness, even if he\nacquires the Triloki. Even, in the golden age, avaricious persons did not get\nhappiness, though they acquired the fruits of their actions.\n\n\n\n69\\. Therefore you get yourselves freed of your sins and obey My order and\nleave the earth and go down to the Patala.\n\n\n\n70\\. Vyasa said :-- On hearing the Devi\xc2\x92s words, the Demons obeyed and bowing\nat Her feet and preserved by Her, went to Patala.\n\n\n\n71\\. Then the Devi disappeared; and the Devas went away to their own homes.\nThus the Devas and the Daityas, abandoning their feelings of enmity towards\neach other, lived in peace.\n\n\n\nO King! He who hears this fact, gets himself freed from all sorts of\ncalamities and reaches the Highest Peace.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifteenth Chapter in the Fourth Book of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am of 18,000 verses, on the truce between the\nDaityas and Devas and on their departures with peace, by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 16](bk04ch16.htm)\n\n"
