He shall not fulfil his sacred duties merely in order to acquire these\nworldly objects (as fame, gain, and honour).\n\n2\\. For when they ought to bring rewards, (duties thus fulfilled) become\nfruitless.\n\n3\\. (Worldly benefits) are produced as accessories (to the fulfilment of the\nlaw), just as in the case of a mango tree, which is planted in order to obtain\nfruit, shade and fragrance (are accessory advantages).\n\np. 72\n\n4\\. But if (worldly advantages) are not produced, (then at least) the sacred\nduties have been fulfilled.\n\n5\\. Let him not become irritated at, nor be deceived by the speeches of\nhypocrites, of rogues, of infidels, and of fools.\n\n6\\. For Virtue and Sin do not go about and say, 'Here we are;' nor do gods,\nGandharvas, or Manes say (to men), 'This is virtue, that is sin.'\n\n7\\. But that is virtue, the practice of which wise men of the three twice-born\ncastes praise; what they blame, is sin. 7\n\n8\\. He shall regulate his course of action according to the conduct which in\nall countries is unanimously approved by men of the three twice-born castes,\nwho have been properly obedient (to their teachers), who are aged, of subdued\nsenses, neither given to avarice, nor hypocrites. 8\n\n9\\. Acting thus he will gain both worlds.\n\n10\\. Trade is not lawful for a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n11\\. In times of distress he may trade in lawful merchandise, avoiding the\nfollowing (kinds), that are forbidden: 11\n\n12\\. (Particularly) men, condiments and liquids, colours, perfumes, food,\nskins, heifers, substances 12\n\np. 73\n\nused for glueing (such as lac), water, young cornstalks, substances from which\nspirituous liquor may be extracted, red and black pepper, corn, flesh, arms,\nand the hope of rewards for meritorious deeds.\n\n13\\. Among (the various kinds of) grain he shall especially not sell sesamum\nor rice (except he have grown them himself). 13\n\n14\\. The exchange of the one of these (abovementioned goods) for the other is\nlikewise unlawful.\n\n15\\. But food (may be exchanged) for food, and slaves for slaves, and\ncondiments for condiments, and perfumes for perfumes, and learning for\nlearning. 15\n\n16\\. Let him traffic with lawful merchandise which he has not bought,\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[72:7](sbe0223.htm#fr_431) **20**. The Sutra is intended to show how the law\nshould be ascertained in difficult cases. Haradatta quotes here the passage of\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 9, on Parishads, and states that the plural arya _h_ shows that\nthree or four must be employed to arrive at a decision. See also Manu XII, 108\nseq.\n\n[72:8](sbe0223.htm#fr_432) Manu I, 6.\n\n[72:11](sbe0223.htm#fr_433) This Sutra, which specifies only one part of a Vai\n_s_ ya's occupations as permissible for Brahma _n_ as in distress, implies,\naccording to Haradatta, that his other occupations also, as well as those of a\nKshatriya, are permissible. Manu IV, 6; X, 82; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 35.\n\n[72:12](sbe0223.htm#fr_434) Manu X, 86-89; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 36-39.\n\n[73:13](sbe0223.htm#fr_435) The exception stated above, is given by Haradatta\non the authority of Manu X, 90; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 39.\n\n[73:15](sbe0223.htm#fr_436) From the permission to exchange learning for\nlearning, it may be known that it is not lawful to sell it.'--Haradatta. Manu\nX, 94.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 7, Kha _n_ _d_ a 21](sbe0224.htm)\n\n"
