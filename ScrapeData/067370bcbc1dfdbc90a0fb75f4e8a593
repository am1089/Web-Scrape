 \nAnd blooms of opening jasmin show  \nThe parting sun has ceased to glow  \nNo captain now for conquest burns,  \nBut homeward with his host returns;  \nFor roads and kings\' ambitious dreams  \nHave vanished neath descending streams.  \nThis is the watery month 3 wherein  \nThe Saman\'s  4 sacred chants begin.  \n\xc3\x81shadha  5 past, now Kosal\'s lord  6  \nThe harvest of the spring has stored,  7  \nAnd dwells within his palace freed  \n\nFrom every care of pressing need  \nFull is the moon, and fierce and strong  \nImpetuous Sarju  [1b](ry303.htm#fn_629) roars along  \nAs though Ayodhya\'s crowds ran out  \nTo greet their king with echoing shout.  \nIn this sweet time of ease and rest  \nNo care disturbs Sugriva\'s breast,  \nThe foe that marred his peace o\'erthrown,  \nAnd queen and realm once more his own.  \nAlas, a harder fate is mine,  \nReft both of realm and queen to pine,  \nAnd, like the bank which floods erode,  \nI sink beneath my sorrow\'s load.  \nSore on my soul my miseries weigh,  \nAnd these long rains our action stay,  \nWhile Ravan seems a mightier foe  \nThan I dare hope to overthrow.  \nI saw the roads were barred by rain,  \nI knew the hopes of war were vain;  \nNor could I bid Sugriva rise,  \nThough prompt to aid my enterprise.  \nE\'en now I scarce can urge my friend  \nOn whom his house and realm depend,  \nWho, after toil and peril past,  \nIs happy with his queen at last.  \nSugriva after rest will know  \nThe hour is come to strike the blow,  \nNor will his grateful soul forget  \nMy succour, or deny the debt  \nI know his generous heart, and hence  \nAwait the time with confidence  \nWhen he his friendly zeal will show,  \nAnd brooks again untroubled flow.\'  [2b](ry303.htm#fn_630)  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[358:1](ry302.htm#fr_619) Malyavat: "The name of this mountain appears to me\nto be erroneous, and I think that instead o\xc2\xa3 Malyavat should be read\nMalayavat, Malaya is a group of mountains situated exactly in that southern\npart of India where Rama now was. while Malyavat is placed to the north east."\nGORRESIO.\n\n[358:2](ry302.htm#fr_620) Mantles of the skin of the black antelope were the\nprescribed dress of ascetics and religious students.\n\n[358:3](ry302.htm#fr_621) The sacred cord worn as the badge of religious\ninitiation by men of the three twice-born castes.\n\n[359:1](ry302.htm#fr_622) The hum with which students con their tasks.\n\n[359:2](ry302.htm#fr_623) I omit here a long general description of the rainy\nseason which ( _is_?) not found in the Bengal recension and appears to have\nbeen interpolated by a far inferior and much later hand than Valmiki\'s. It is\ncomposed in a metre different from that of the rest of the Canto, and contains\nfigures of poetical rhetoric and commonplaces which are the delight of more\nrecent poets.\n\n[359:3](ry302.htm#fr_624) Praushthapada or Bhadra, the modern *Bhaden*,\ncorresponds to half of August and half of September.\n\n[359:4](ry302.htm#fr_625) The Saman or Sama-veda, the third of the four Vedas,\nis really merely a reproduction of parts of the Rig-veda, transposed and\nscattered about piece-meal, only 78 verses in the whole being, it is said,\nuntraceable to the present recension of the Rig-veda.\n\n[359:5](ry302.htm#fr_626) \xc3\x81shadha is the month corresponding to parts of June\nand July.\n\n[359:6](ry302.htm#fr_627) Bharat, who was regent during Rama\'s absence.\n\n[359:7](ry302.htm#fr_628) Or with Goriesio, following the gloss of another\ncommentary: "Has completed every holy rite and accumulated stores of merit."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXIX.: Hanuman\'s Counsel.](ry303.htm)\n\n'
