The \xc3\x82graya _n_ a graha, forsooth, is his self (body, trunk), and as\nsuch it is his all; for this self is one's all. Therefore he draws it by means\nof this (earth), for of her is the bowl 2, and with a bowl he draws this\n(libation); and this (earth) is all, as this\n\np. 289\n\ngraha is all: hence he takes it by means of this (earth).\n\n4:2:2:22\\. He draws it full; for the 'full' means all, and this graha is all:\ntherefore he draws it full.\n\n4:2:2:33: He draws it for the All-gods; for the All-gods are all, and this\ngraha is all: therefore he draws it for the All-gods.\n\n4:2:2:44\\. He draws it at all (three) Soma feasts; for the (three) feasts mean\nall, and this graha is all: therefore he draws it at all the feasts.\n\n4:2:2:55\\. And if the king (Soma) become exhausted, they extend him from out\nof that (bowl), make him issue therefrom; for the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a is the body,\nand from the body all these limbs issue. Therefrom they draw at the end the\nHariyo _g_ ana cup 1: whereby the sacrifice is established at the end in this\nresting-place, the body (or its own self).\n\n4:2:2:66\\. Then as to why it is called \xc3\x82graya _n_ a. His speech which he\nrestrains, on taking up that press-stone 2, spoke out again first at this\n(libation); and because it spoke out first (agre) at this (libation),\ntherefore this is called the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a 3.\n\n4:2:2:77\\. It was from fear of the evil spirits that (the gods) restrained\ntheir speech. Previously to this he draws six grahas, and this is the seventh:\nfor there are six seasons in the year, and the year is all.\n\n4:2:2:88\\. And all being conquered and free from danger and injury 4, the gods\nnow first uttered speech; and\n\np. 290\n\nin like manner does he first utter speech now that everything is conquered and\nfree from danger and injury.\n\n4:2:2:99\\. He now draws it from that (stream of Soma 1) with (Va _g_. S. VII,\n19; Rig-veda I, 139, 11), 'Ye Gods, who are eleven in heaven, who are eleven\non earth, and who are eleven dwelling in glory in the (aerial) waters: do ye\ngraciously accept this sacrifice!--Thou art taken with a support: thou art\n\xc3\x82graya _n_ a, a good firstling (sv-agraya _n_ a)!' Hereby he makes that speech\nof renewed vigour; whence he speaks therewith in a different way, while yet\nthe same, in order to avoid sameness; for were he to take it with, 'Thou art\n\xc3\x82graya _n_ a, thou art \xc3\x82graya _n_ a,' he would commit (the fault of) sameness:\ntherefore he says, 'Thou art \xc3\x82graya _n_ a, a good agraya _n_ a.'\n\n4:2:2:1010\\. 'Guard the sacrifice! guard the lord of the sacrifice!' whereby\nhe utters freed speech, meaning to say, 'Protect the sacrifice! protect the\nsacrificer!' for the lord of the sacrifice is the sacrificer. 'May Vish _n_\nu-guard thee with his might! guard thou Vish _n_ u!' whereby he utters freed\nspeech--Vish _n_ u being the sacrifice--'May the sacrifice\n\np. 291\n\nprotect thee with its power! protect thou the sacrifice!'--'Guard thou the\nSoma feasts all around!' whereby he means this very graha, because that\nbelongs to all (three) Soma feasts 1.\n\n4:2:2:1111\\. Having then wrapped up (the bowl in) a fringed filtering-cloth,\nhe utters 'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85!' Now that same speech (Va _k_ , fem.), being unsupported, lay\nexhausted. By means of the 'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85' the gods infused breath into that exhausted\nspeech, for the 'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85' is breath, the 'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85' is indeed breath: hence one cannot\nutter the sound 'hi\xe1\xb9\x85' after closing his nostrils. By means of that breath she\nrose again, for when one who is exhausted takes breath, he rises again. And in\nlike manner does he now infuse breath into the exhausted speech by means of\nthe 'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85,' and through. that breath she rises again. Thrice he utters the\n'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85,' for threefold is the sacrifice.\n\n4:2:2:1212\\. He then says (Va _g_. S. VII, 21), 'Soma becometh pure!' For that\n(speech) which, for fear of the Asura-Rakshas, they (the gods) did not utter,\nhe now utters and reveals when all is conquered and free from danger and\ninjury: therefore he says, 'Soma becometh pure.'\n\n4:2:2:1313\\. 'For this priesthood, for this nobility'--whereby he means to\nsay, 'for the priesthood as well as for the nobility for the Soma-pressing\nsacrificer he becometh pure;' whereby he means to say, 'for the sacrificer.'\n\n4:2:2:1414\\. Here now they say, 'Having said this much, let him deposit (the\ncup); for as much as the priesthood, and the nobility, and the people are, so\nmuch\n\np. 292\n\nmeans this All, since Indra and Agni are this All 1: hence, having said this\nmuch, let him deposit (the cup).'\n\n4:2:2:1515\\. Let him, nevertheless, say this more, 'For sap and pith he\nbecometh pure,'--by saying 'for sap' he means to say 'for rain;' and 'for\npith' he says with a view to that pith or juice which springs from rain;--'for\nthe waters and plants he becometh pure,' this he says for the waters and\nplants;--'for heaven and earth he becometh pure,' this he says for those two,\nheaven and earth, whereon this All rests;--'for well-being he becometh pure,'\nwhereby he means to say 'for good.'\n\n4:2:2:1616\\. Here now some say, 'for spiritual lustre he becometh pure;' but\nlet him not say so, for in saying 'for this priesthood,' he says it with a\nview to spiritual lustre. With, 'Thee for the All-gods! this is thy womb: thee\nfor the All-gods!' he deposits (the cup); for it is for the All-gods that he\ndraws it. He deposits it in the middle (of the mound); for this is his trunk,\nand that trunk is, as it were, in the middle. On the right (south) side of it\nis the Ukthya bowl, and on the left side the \xc3\x82ditya bowl.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[288:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_697) The order of the dhish _n_ ya-priests is (1. Hot\n_ri_ ), 2. Pra _s_ ast _ri_ (Maitravaru _n_ a), 3. Brahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_\nsin, 4. Pot _ri_ ; 5. Nesh _t_ _ri_ , 6. A _kh_ avaka--the fires of all of\nwhom are in the Sadas--and 7. the Agnidh (in the \xc3\x82gnidhra fire-house). The A\n_kh_ avaka, however, is for the present excluded from offering.\n\n[288:2](sbe2646.htm#fr_698) Viz. inasmuch as the bowl is made of clay,--asya\n_h_ p _ri_ thivya _h_ saka _s_ at sthali bhavati utpadyate; Say. The \xc3\x82graya\n_n_ a, Ukthya, and Dhruva grahas are drawn in a sthali (pot or bowl).\n\n[289:1](sbe2646.htm#fr_699) See [IV, 4, 3, 2](sbe2657.htm#4:4:3:2).\n\n[289:2](sbe2646.htm#fr_700) The Upa _m_ _s_ usavana, cf. [III, 9, 4,\n6](sbe2639.htm#3:9:4:6).\n\n[289:3](sbe2646.htm#fr_701) The primary meaning seems to be 'firstling.' For\nthe \xc3\x82graya _n_ esh _t_ i, or offering of first-fruits, see part i, p. 369.\n\n[289:4](sbe2646.htm#fr_702) Or perhaps, 'and their entire conquest being free\nfrom danger and injury;' or, 'security and peace (abhayam anash _t_ ram)\nhaving p. 290 been completely gained.' Cf. [IV, 3, 3, 5](sbe2652.htm#4:3:3:5);\nalso [III, 6, 3, 11](sbe2625.htm#3:6:3:11); [8, 1, 9](sbe2631.htm#3:8:1:9);\n[8, 2, 3](sbe2632.htm#3:8:2:3).\n\n[290:1](sbe2646.htm#fr_703) The \xc3\x82graya _n_ a is taken rather from two streams\nof Soma, viz. from that poured by the sacrificer from the Hot _ri_ 's cup into\nthe Dro _n_ akala _s_ a, and from another poured out by the Unnet _ri_ , and\nconsisting either of Soma taken from the \xc3\x82dhavaniya or, according to others,\nof the residue of the Upa _m_ _s_ u libation, which had been temporarily kept\nin the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a bowl (see [p. 255](sbe2640.htm#page_255), note\n[2](sbe2640.htm#fn_618)), and has to be emptied by the Unnet _ri_ into some\nother vessel, when that bowl is about to be used for the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a\nlibation. See Katy. IX, 6, 15 comm.\n\n[291:1](sbe2646.htm#fr_704) The \xc3\x82graya _n_ a libation is repeated at the\nmidday as well as at the evening feast.\n\n[292:1](sbe2646.htm#fr_705) On Indra and Agni, as the divine representatives\nof the two privileged castes, see part i, Introd. p. xvi seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 3.
