(The pradhana cannot be designated by the term 'Self') because release is\ntaught of him who takes his stand on that (the Sat).\n\nThe non-intelligent pradhana cannot be the object of the term 'Self' because\nin the passage _Kh_. Up. VI, 2 ff., where the subtle Sat which is under\ndiscussion is at first referred to in the sentence, 'That is the Self,' and\nwhere the subsequent clause, 'That art thou, O _S_ vetaketu,' declares the\nintelligent _S_ vetaketu to have his abode in the Self, a passage subsequent\nto the two quoted (viz. 'a man who has a teacher obtains true knowledge; for\nhim there is only delay as long as he is not delivered, then he will be\nperfect') declares final release. For if the non-intelligent pradhana were\ndenoted by the term 'Sat' and did comprehend--by means of the phrase 'That art\nthou'--persons desirous of final release who as such are intelligent, the\nmeaning could only be 'Thou art non-intelligent;' so that Scripture would\nvirtually make contradictory statements to the disadvantage of man, and would\nthus cease to be a means of right knowledge. But to assume that the faultless\n_s_ astra is not a means of right knowledge, would be contrary to reason. And\nif the _s_ astra, considered as a means of right knowledge, should point out\nto a man desirous of release, but ignorant of the way to it, a non-intelligent\nSelf as the real Self, he would--comparable to the blind man who had caught\nhold of the ox's tail 1\\--cling to the view of that being the Self,\n\np. 56\n\nand thus never be able to reach the real Self different from the false Self\npointed out to him; hence he would be debarred from what constitutes man's\ngood, and would incur evil. We must therefore conclude that, just as the _s_\nastra teaches the agnihotra and similar performances in their true nature as\nmeans for those who are desirous of the heavenly world, so the passage 'that\nis the Self, that art thou, O _S_ vetaketu,' teaches the Self in its true\nnature also. Only on that condition release for him whose thoughts are true\ncan be taught by means of the simile in which the person to be released is\ncompared to the man grasping the heated axe ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 16). For in the\nother case, if the doctrine of the Sat constituting the Self had a secondary\nmeaning only, the cognition founded on the passage 'that art thou' would be of\nthe nature of a fanciful combination only 1, like the knowledge derived from\nthe passage, 'I am the hymn' (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 1, 2, 6), and would lead to a mere\ntransitory reward; so that the simile quoted could not convey the doctrine of\nrelease. Therefore the word 'Self is applied to the subtle Sat not in a merely\nfigurative sense. In the case of the faithful servant, on the other hand, the\nword 'Self' can--in such phrases as 'Bhadrasena is my Self'--be taken in a\nfigurative sense, because the difference between master and servant is well\nestablished by perception. Moreover, to assume that, because words are\nsometimes seen to be used in figurative senses, a figurative sense may be\nresorted to in the case of those things also for which words (i.e. Vedic\nwords) are the only means of knowledge, is altogether indefensible; for an\nassumption of that nature would lead to a general want of confidence. The\nassertion that the word 'Self' may (primarily) signify what is non-intelligent\nas well as what is intelligent, just as the word ' _g_ yotis' signifies a\ncertain sacrifice as well as light, is inadmissible, because we have no right\nto attribute to words a plurality of meanings. Hence (we rather assume that)\nthe word 'Self' in its primary meaning refers to what is intelligent only and\nis then, by a figurative\n\np. 57\n\nattribution of intelligence, applied to the elements and the like also; whence\nsuch phrases as 'the Self of the elements,' 'the Self of the senses.' And even\nif we assume that the word 'Self' primarily signifies both classes of beings,\nwe are unable to settle in any special case which of the two meanings the word\nhas, unless we are aided either by the general heading under which it stands,\nor some determinative attributive word. But in the passage under discussion\nthere is nothing to determine that the word refers to something non-\nintelligent, while, on the other hand, the Sat distinguished by thought forms\nthe general heading, and _S_ vetaketu, i.e. a being endowed with intelligence,\nis mentioned in close proximity. That a non-intelligent Self does not agree\nwith _S_ vetaketu, who possesses intelligence, we have already shown. All\nthese circumstances determine the object of the word 'Self' here to be\nsomething intelligent. The word ' _g_ yotis' does moreover not furnish an\nappropriate example; for according to common use it has the settled meaning of\n'light' only, and is used in the sense of sacrifice only on account of the\narthavada assuming a similarity (of the sacrifice) to light.\n\nA different explanation of the Sutra is also possible. The preceding Sutra may\nbe taken completely to refute all doubts as to the word 'Self' having a\nfigurative or double sense, and then the present Sutra is to be explained as\ncontaining an independent reason, proving that the doctrine of the pradhana\nbeing the general cause is untenable.\n\nHence the non-intelligent pradhana is not denoted by the word 'Self.' This the\nteacher now proceeds to prove by an additional reason.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[55:1](sbe34013.htm#fr_100) A wicked man meets in a forest a blind person who\nhas lost his way, and implores him to lead him to his village; instead of\ndoing so the wicked man persuades the blind one to catch hold of the tail of\nan ox, which he promises would lead him to his place.
