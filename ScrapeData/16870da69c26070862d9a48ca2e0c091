Naraya _n_ a said :-- Now I shall speak of the Gayatri-puras\xc2\x92chara _n_\nam. Hear. By its performance all the desires are obtained and all the sins are\ndestroyed. On the tops of mountains, on the banks of the rivers, on the roots\nof Bel trees, on the edges of tanks, within the enclosures of the cows (cow-\nstalls), in temples, on the root of As\xc2\x92vattha trees, in gardens, in the Tulasi\ngroves, in the Pu _n_ ya K _s_ etrams (holy places), before one\xc2\x92s Guru, or\nwherever the mind feels exalted and cheerful, and gets strength, the\nPuras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am if performed, lead to a speedy success. Before commencing\nthe Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am of a mantra (the Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am means repetition of\nthe name of a deity or of a mantra attended with burnt offerings, oblations,\netc.,) first Prayas\xc2\x92chitta (penance) is done in the shape of repeating one\nmillion times the Gayatri with the Vyarhitis. In any Vaidic Karma or in making\nPuras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am of the mantra of the Devatas Nrisi _n_ ha, Surya, Varaha,\netc., the first thing done is to repeat the Gayatri. Without the japam of\nGayatri, no action is attended with success. The reason is this :-- Every\nBrahma _n_ is a S\xc2\x92akta (a follower of S\xc2\x92akti); he cannot be a Vai _sn_ ava or\nS\xc2\x92aiva; for he is the worshipper of the Prime Force Vedamata Gayatri.\nTherefore obtain first the Grace of one\xc2\x92s own \xc3\x8e _st_ a Devata Gayatri by Her\nJapam. Then worship the other Deities.\n\n\n\nThus one should purify one\xc2\x92s japya mantra (the mantra that is to be repeated)\nby first repeating one million times the Gayatri; then one is to commence\nPuras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am. Again before purifying the mantra, one is to purify one\xc2\x92s\n\xc3\x82tman (Self). In this purification of one\xc2\x92s \xc3\x82tman three lakh times, in case of\ninability, one lakh times Gayatri is to be repeated without one\xc2\x92s \xc3\x82tman\xc2\x92s\npurification, the Japam, Homa and other actions all become useless. This is\nspecially noted in the Vedas. By Tapas e.g., Japam, Chandraya _n_ a and Vrata,\n(asceticism) mortify your body. By offering Tarpa _n_ am (peace-offerings) to\nthe Fathers and the Devas, one can get self purification. If you want to get\nthe Heavens and if you want to become great, practise Tapasya. There is no\nother way. Tapasya is the intent calling of the Mother, That Call which\npenetrates through and through the\n\n\n\np. 1121\n\n\n\nBrahma _nd_ a. The K _s_ attriyas should cross difficulties and dangers by\nforce of arms; the Vais\xc2\x92yas, by wealth; the S\xc2\x92udras, by serving the twice\nborn; and the Brahma _n_ as should cross difficulties and dangers, by Tapasya,\nHoma, Japam, etc. So the Brahma _n_ as should always be cheerful and in prompt\nreadiness to do Tapasya. Of all sorts of tapasyas, mortifying the body by\nobserving vows and fastings is the best. So say the Ri _s_ is. (This\nmortification of the body gives self-reliance and self intuition more surely\nand speedily than all the other studies and other practices.) The Brahma _n_\nas should purify themselves by following duly Krichhra Chandraya _n_ a vratas,\netc., O Narada! Now I am speaking of the purification of food. Hear. The\nfollowing four occupations of the Brahma _n_ as are the best :-- Ayachita,\n(without begging or asking for anything), Unchha, (the gathering in of\nhandfuls of the corn left by the reapers), S\xc2\x92ukla (the maintenance derived by\na Brahma _n_ a from other Brahma _n_ as; a pure mode of life). And Bhik _s_ u\n(begging). Whether according to the Tantras or according to the Vedas, the\nfood obtained by the above four means is pure. What is earned by Bhik _s_ a\n(begging) is divided into four parts :-- one part is given to the Brahma _n_\nas; the second part is given to the cows; the third part is given to the\nguests, the fourth part is to be taken by him and his wife. Whatever is fixed\nfor taking (swallowing) mouthfuls of food, that is to be taken on a tray or a\nplatter. First throw a little cow-urine over that and count duly the number of\nmouthfuls. The mouthfuls are to be of the size of an egg; the house-holders\nare to take eight such mouthfuls and the Vanaprasthis are to take four such\nmouthfuls. The Brahmacharins can sprinkle their food with cow-urine nine\ntimes, six times, or three times as they like; while sprinkling, the fingers\nare to remain intact. The Gayatri is to be repeated also. The food offered by\na thief, Cha _nd_ ala, K _s_ attriya or Vais\xc2\x92ya is very inferior. The food of\na S\xc2\x92udra, or the companion with a S\xc2\x92udra or taking food in the same line with\na S\xc2\x92udra leads one to suffer in the terrible hells as long as there are the\nSun and Moon. The Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am of Gayatri is repeating this twenty four\nlakh times (i.e., as many lakh times as there are syllables in the Gayatri).\nBut, according to Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, repeating thirty two lakh times is the\nPuras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am of Gayatri. As the body becomes useless when the soul\nleaves the body, so the mantra without Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am is useless. The\nPuras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am is prohibited in the months of Jyai _st_ ha, \xc3\x82 _s_ a _d_\nha, Pau _s_ a and Mala (dirty) months. Also on Tuesday, Saturday; in the\nVyatipata and Vaidhriti Yogas; also in A _st_ ami (eighth), Navami (ninth),\n_S_ a _st_ hi (sixth), Chaturthi (fourth) Trayodas\xc2\x92i (thirteenth), Chaturdasi\n(fourteenth) and Amavasya (New Moon), Tithis (lunar days); in the evening\ntwilight and in the night; while\n\n\n\np. 1122\n\n\n\nthe star Bhara _n_ i, Krittika, \xc3\x82rdra, As\xc2\x92le _s_ a, Jye _st_ ha, Dhani _st_\nha, S\xc2\x92rava _n_ a, or the Janma nak _s_ atra (Birth time star) is with the\nMoon; while the signs Me _s_ a, Karka _t_ a, Tula, Kumbha, and Makara are the\nLagnas (signs in the ascendant). When the moon and the start are auspicious,\nespecially in the bright fortnight, the Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am performed, gives\nthe Mantra Siddhi. First of all repeat Svasti vachan and perform duly the\nNandi mukha S\xc2\x92raddha and give food and clothing to the Brahma _n_ as. Take the\npermission of the Brahma _n_ as and begin the Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am. Where the\nS\xc2\x92iva Lingam exists, facing west, or in any S\xc2\x92iva temple, commence repeating\nthe mantra. The other S\xc2\x92iva K _s_ ettrams are :-- Kas\xc2\x92i, Kedara, Maha Kala,\nS\xc2\x92ri K _s_ ettra, and Tryamvakam. These five are the Great K _s_ ettrams,\nknown widely on this earth, for the fructification and the siddhis of the\nMantras. At all other places than these, the Karma Chakra is to be drawn\naccording to the principles of the Tantra. And then they will be fit for\nPuras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am. The number of times that the Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am (the\nrepeating of the mantra) is done on the first day, the same number is to be\ncontinued every day until completion; not greater nor less than that and also\nno intermission or stoppage should occur in the interval.\n\n\n\nThe repeating of the Mantra is to be commenced in the morning and should be\ndone up to midday. While doing this, the mind is to be kept free from other\nsubjects, and it is to be kept pure; one is to meditate on one\xc2\x92s own Deity and\non the meaning of the mantra and one should be particularly careful that no\ninaccuracies nor omissions should occur in the Gayatri, Chhandas and in the\nrepetition of the Mantra. One tenth of the total number of Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ ams\nthat are repeated is to be used for the Homa purpose. The Charu is to be\nprepared with ghee, til, the Bel leaves, flowers, jaya grain, honey and sugar;\nall mixed, are to be offered as oblations to the fire in the Homa. Then the\nsuccess in the Mantra comes (i.e., mantra siddhi is obtained or the Mantra\nbecomes manifested). After the Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am one should do properly the\ndaily and occasional duties and worship the Gayatri that brings in dharma,\nwealth, objects of desire and liberation. There is nothing superior an object\nof worship to this Gayatri, whether in this world or in the next. The devotee,\nengaged in the Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am, should eat moderately, observe silence,\nbathe thrice in the three Sandhya times, should be engaged in worshipping\none\xc2\x92s Deity, should not he unmindful and should not do any other work. He is\nto remain, while in water, to repeat the Gayatri three lakhs of times. In case\nthe devotee repeats the\n\n\n\np. 1123\n\n\n\nmantra for achieving success in any other desired work (kamya karma), then he\nshould willingly stick to it until the desired success is attained. Now is\nbeing told how to get success in ordinary Kamya karmas. When the sun is\nrising, repeat the Puraschara _n_ am mantra daily thousand times. Then one\xc2\x92s\nlife will be lengthened, no disease will occur, and wealth and prosperity will\nbe obtained. If it be done this way, success is surely attained within three\nmonths, six months or at the end of one year. If the Homa (offering oblations\nto the fire) be offered one lakh times with lotuses besmeared with ghee\n(clarified butter), Mok _s_ a (liberation) is attained. If, before the Mantra-\nSiddhi, or the success in realising the Mantra, is attained, one performs\nJapam or Homam for Kamya Siddhi (to get certain desires) or mok _s_ a, then\nall his actions become useless. If anybody performs twenty-five lakh Homas by\ncurd and milk, be gets success (Siddhi) in this very birth. So all the Mahar\n_s_ is say. By this the same result is attained that is got by the aforesaid\nmeans, i.e., by the eight-limbed Yoga, whereby the Yogis become perfect.\n\n\n\nHe will attain Siddhi if he be devoted to his Guru and keep himself under\nrestraint for six months only (i.e., practise Samyama) as regards taking food,\netc., whether he be incapable or his mind be attached to other sensual\nobjects. One should drink Pa\xc3\xb1cha gavya (cow-urine, cow-dung, milk, curd, ghee)\none day, fast one day, take Brahma _n_ a\xc2\x92s food one day and be mindful in\nrepeating the Gayatri. First bathe in the Ganges or in other sacred places and\nwhile in water repeat one hundred Gayatris. If one drinks water on which one\nhundred Gayatris are repeated, one is freed from all one\xc2\x92s sins. He gets the\nfruit of performing the Krichhra vrata, the Chandraya _n_ a vrata and others.\nBe he a K _s_ attriya King, or a Brahma _n_ a, if he is to remain in his own\nhouse, hold \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama and be engaged in performing Tapasya then he will be\ncertainly freed of all his sins. Be he a house holder or a Brahmachari or\nVanaprasthi, he should perform sacrifices, etc., according to his Adhikara (or\nhis rights) and he will get fruits according to his desires. The Sagnik man\n(who keeps the Holy Fire) and other persons of good conduct and of learning\nand of good education should perform actions as prescribed in the Vedas and\nSmritis with a desire to attain Mok _s_ a. Thus one should eat fruits and\nvegetables and and water or take eight mouthfuls of Bhik _s_ anna (the food\ngot by begging). If the Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am be performed this way, then the\nMantra Siddhi is obtained. O Narada ! If the Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ am be done with\nthe mantra thus, his poverty is removed entirely. What more shall I say than\nthis that if anybody hears this simply, his merits get increased and he\nattains great success.\n\n\n\np. 1124\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty First Chapter of the Eleventh Book on Gayatri Puras\xc2\x92chara\n_n_ am in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 22](bk11ch22.htm)\n\n'
