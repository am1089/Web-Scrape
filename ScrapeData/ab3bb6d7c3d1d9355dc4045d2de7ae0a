Regarding the term Snataka, see \xc3\x82pastamba\nI, 11, 30, 1-4. Govinda thinks that the following rules are intended to apply\nIn the first instance to a student who has performed the Samavartana on\ncompletion of his studentship and lives unmarried at home. For though the Sm\n_ri_ ti declares it necessary for a student to enter, on completing his term,\nat once into one of the remaining three p. 159 orders, it may happen; as the\ncommentator observes, that the Snataka\'s marriage cannot take place\nimmediately. The correctness of this view is proved by \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 8, and\nby the fact that below, II, 3, 5, the rules for a married Snataka are given\nseparately.\n\n[159:2](sbe1438.htm#fr_802)-5. Vasish _th_ a XII, 14.\n\n[159:6](sbe1438.htm#fr_803) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 8, 2.\n\n[159:7](sbe1438.htm#fr_804) Regarding the Parva days, see Vasish _th_ a XII,\n21 note.\n\n[159:8](sbe1438.htm#fr_805) Vasish _th_ a XII, 2-4. \'Though the Snataka is the\nsubject of the discussion, the word "his" is used (in this Sutra) in order to\nintroduce the remaining duties of a householder also.\'--Govinda.\n\n[159:9](sbe1438.htm#fr_806) The carpenter (rathakara) is a _S_ udra, but\nconnected with the Vedic sacrifices.\n\n[159:10](sbe1438.htm#fr_807) \'"Food" (bhaiksham), i.e. a quantity of begged\nfood. The meaning is that in times of distress he may beg from many.\'--\nGovinda.\n\n[159:12](sbe1438.htm#fr_808) With that, i.e. with the food obtained by\nbegging. Regarding p. 160 the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, see Gautama VIII, 18. Govinda\ngives as an instance of the rites securing welfare (bhutikarma _n_ i) the\nayushya _k_ aru, a rice-offering intended to procure long life.\n\n[160:13](sbe1438.htm#fr_809) Govinda explains Baudhayana by Ka _n_ vayana, and\nadds that either the author speaks of himself in the third person or a pupil\nmust have compiled the book.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 4, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 6](sbe1439.htm)\n\n'
