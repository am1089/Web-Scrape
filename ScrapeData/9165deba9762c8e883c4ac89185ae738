What is given to another than a Brahma _n_ a produces the same fruit in\nthe world to come.\n\n2\\. (What is given) to one who calls himself a Brahma _n_ a (because he was\nborn and initiated as such, but who does not perform his daily duties)\nproduces twice the same fruit.\n\n3\\. (What is given) to one who has studied the main portions of the Veda\nproduces a thousand times the same fruit.\n\n[XCIII. 1-4. M. VII, 85; Gaut. V, 20.--7. M. IV, 192.--8. M. IV, 195.--9-13.\nM. IV, 196-200.\n\n1\\. 'The term abrahma _n_ a (one not a Brahma _n_ a) refers to Kshatriyas and\nthe like. Kulluka on M. VII, 85. Dr. Buhler's rendering of Gautama V, 20\nagrees with this interpretation. Nand., on the other hand, refers the term\nabrahma _n_ a to six kinds of Brahma _n_ as enumerated by _S_ atatapa, who\nhave infringed the rule of their caste by taking their substance from a king,\nor by selling or buying forbidden articles, or by sacrificing for a multitude\nof persons, &c. The term 'the same fruit' means that a person shall receive in\na future world what he has given in this. (Nand.)]\n\np. 273\n\n4\\. (What is given) to one who has mastered the whole Veda, produces infinite\nfruit.\n\n5\\. A domestic priest may claim gifts from his own employer (but from no one\nelse).\n\n6\\. And so may a sister, a daughter and sons-in-law (or other connections\nclaim gifts from their. brother, father, &c., but not from a stranger).\n\n7\\. One who knows his duty must not give even water to a twice-born man who\nacts like a cat, or to a Brahma _n_ a who acts like a crane, or to one who has\nnot studied the Veda.\n\n8\\. One who constantly hoists the flag of religion, and who is avaricious,\ncrafty, deceitful, pitiless, and a calumniator of everybody, such a man is\nsaid to act like a cat.\n\n9\\. One who hangs his head, who is bent upon, injuring others and upon his own\ngain, artful, and falsely demure, such a man is said to act like, a crane.\n\n10\\. Those who act like cranes in this world, and those who act like cats,\nfall into (the hell called) Andhatamisra[1] on account . of their wickedness.\n\n11\\. If a man has committed an offence and does penance for it, he must not do\nso under pretext of performing an act of piety, covering his crime under a\n(fictitious) vow, and imposing on women and _S_ udras.\n\n12\\. A Brahma _n_ a who acts thus, is despised in the next life and in this by\nthose who know the Veda, and the penance performed by him under such false\npretence goes to the (demons called) Rakshasas.\n\n[10. 1 See XLIII, 3.]\n\np. 176\n\n13\\. One who gains his subsistence by wearing (a lock on the crown of the head\nor other) distinguishing marks of a caste or religious order, to which he does\nnot belong, takes upon himself the (consequences of the) sins committed by\nthose who have a right to those marks, and enters in a future birth the womb\nof an animal.\n\n14\\. He must not give (to a panegyrist) from vain-glory, or from fear, or to a\nfriend (from whom he hopes to obtain benefit), nor (must he bestow gifts),\nwith a view to acquire religious merit, upon dancers or singers:, that is a\nfixed rule.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XCIV.](sbe07096.htm)\n\n"
