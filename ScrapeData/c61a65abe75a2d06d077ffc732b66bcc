Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Best of Munis! What shall I describe to you the\neffects of using the Bhasma! Only applying the ashes takes away the\nMahapatakas (great sins) as well as other minor sins of the devotee. I speak\nthis truly, very truly unto you. Now hear the fruits of using simply the\nashes. By using Bhasma, the knowledge of Brahma comes to the Yatis; the\ndesires of enjoyments are eradicated; the improvement\n\n\n\np. 1086\n\n\n\nis felt in all the virtuous actions of the householders and the studies of the\nVedas and other S\xc2\x92astras of the Brahmacharis get their increase. The S\xc2\x92udras\nget merits in using Bhasmas and the sins of others are destroyed. To besmear\nthe body with ashes and to apply the curved Tripu _nd_ ras is the source of\ngood to all beings. The S\xc2\x92ruti says so. That this implies the performance of\nsacrifices by all, is also asserted in the S\xc2\x92rutis. To apply ashes to the\nwhole of the body and to use Tripu _nd_ ra is common to all the religions; it\nhas nothing, in principle, contradictory to others. So the S\xc2\x92ruti says. This\nTripu _nd_ ra and the besmearing with ashes is the special mark of the\ndevotees of S\xc2\x92iva; this again is asserted in the S\xc2\x92ruti. This Bhasma and the\nTripu _nd_ ra are the special marks by which one is characterised; it is said\nso in the Vaidik S\xc2\x92ruti. S\xc2\x92iva, Vi _sn_ u, Brahma, Indra, Hira _n_ yagarbha,\nand their Avataras, Varu _n_ a and the whole host of the Devas all gladly used\nthis Tripu _nd_ ra and ashes. Durga, Lak _s_ mi, and Sarasvati, etc., all the\nwives of the gods daily anoint their bodies with ashes and use the Tripu _nd_\nras. So even the Yak _s_ as, Rak _s_ asas, Gandharbhas, Sidhas, Vidyadharas,\nand the Munis have applied Bhasma and Tripu _nd_ ra. This holding on of ashes\nis not prohibited to anybody; the Brahma _n_ as, K _s_ attriyas, Vais\xc2\x92yas,\nS\xc2\x92udras, mixed castes, and the vile classes all can use this Bhasma and Tripu\n_nd_ ra. O Narada! In my opinion they only are the Sadhus (saints) who use\nthis Tripu _nd_ ra and besmear their bodies with ashes. In seducing this Lady\nMukti (liberation is personified here as a lady) one is to have this gem of\nS\xc2\x92iva Lingam, the five lettered Mantra Namah S\xc2\x92ivaya as the loving principle,\nand holding on the ashes as the charming medicine (as in seducing any ordinary\nwoman, gems, jewels and ornaments, love and charming medicines are necessary).\nO Narada! Know the place where the person, who has besmeared the holy with\nashes and who has used Tripu _nd_ ra takes his food as where S\xc2\x92ankara and\nS\xc2\x92ankari have taken their food together. Even if anybody himself not using the\nBhasma, follows another who has used the Bhasma, he will be soon honoured in\nthe society even if he be a sinner. What more than this, if anybody himself\nnot using the ashes, praises another who uses the Bhasma, he is freed from all\nhis sins and gets soon honour and respect in the society. All the studies of\nthe Vedas come to him though he has not studied the Vedas, all the fruits of\nhearing the S\xc2\x92rutis and the Pura _n_ as come to him, though he has not heard\nthem, all the fruits of practised Dharma come to him though he has not\npractised any, if he always uses this Tripu _nd_ ra on his forehead and gives\nfood to a beggar who uses Tripu _nd_ ra on his forehead. Even in courtries as\nBihar (Kika _t_ a, etc., that have got a bad name) if there be a single man in\nthe whole country whose body is besmeared with ashes and who uses this Tripu\n_nd_ ra, that is considered then as Kas\xc2\x92i (Benares\n\n\n\np. 1087\n\n\n\ncity). Anybody, of a bad or of a good character, be he a Yogi or a sinner,\nusing Bhasma, is worshipped like my son, Brahma. O Narada! Even if an\nhypocrite uses Bhasma, he will have a good future, which cannot be attained\neven by performing hundreds of sacrifices. If anybody uses Bhasma daily either\nthrough good companion or through neglect, he will be entitled, like me, to\nthe highest worship. O Narada! Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes\xc2\x92vara, Parvati, Lak _s_\nmi, Sarasvati and all the other Devas become satisfied with simply holding on\nthis Bhasma. The merits that are obtained by using only the Tripu _nd_ ra,\ncannot be obtained by gifts, sacrifices, severe austerities, and going to\nsacred places of pilgrimages. They cannot give one-sixteenth part of the\nresult that accrues from holding the Tripu _nd_ ra. As a King recognises a\nperson as his own, whom he has given some object of recognition, so Bhagavan\nS\xc2\x92ankara knows the man who uses Tripu _nd_ ras as His own person. They that\nhold Tripu _nd_ ras with devotion can have Bhola Natha under their control; no\ndistinction is made here between the Brahma _n_ as and Cha _nd_ alas. Even if\nanybody be fallen from the state of observing all the \xc3\x82charas or rules of\nconduct proper to his \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama and if he be faulty in not attending to all his\nduties, he will be Mukta (freed) if he has used even once this Bhasma Tripu\n_nd_ ra. Never bother yourself with the caste or the family of the holder of\nthe Tripu _nd_ ras. Only see whether the sign Tripu _nd_ ra exists in his\nforehead. If so, consider him entitled to respect. O Narada! There is no\nmantra higher than this S\xc2\x92iva Mantra; there is no Deity higher than S\xc2\x92iva;\nthere is no worship of greater merit-giving powers than the worship of S\xc2\x92iva;\nso there is no Tirtha superior to this Bhasma. This Bhasma is not an ordinary\nthing; it is the excellent energy (semen virile) of fire of the nature of\nRudra. All sorts of troubles vanish, all sorts of sins are destroyed by this\nBhasma. The country where the lowest castes reside with their bodies besmeared\nwith ashes, is inhabited always by Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ankara, Bhagavati Uma, the\nPramathas (the attendants of S\xc2\x92iva) and by all the Tirthas. Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ankara,\nfirst of all, held this Bhasma as an ornament to his body by purifying it\nfirst with \xc2\x93Sadyo Jata,\xc2\x94 etc., the five mantras. Therefore if anybody uses the\nBhasma Tripu _nd_ ra according to rules on his forehead, the writings written\nat the time of his birth by Vidhata Brahma will all be cancelled, if they had\nbeen bad. There is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirteenth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the greatness of\nBhasma in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 14](bk11ch14.htm)\n\n'
