The Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n[3](errata.htm#0). Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a. "That in which Para\xc5\x9bara, beginning with\nthe events of the Varaha Kalpa, expounds all duties, is called the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava;\nand the learned know its extent to be twenty-three thousand stanzas 41." The\nthird Puran\xcc\x81a of the lists is that which has been selected for translation,\nthe Vishn\xcc\x81u. It is unnecessary therefore to offer any general summary of its\ncontents, and it will be convenient to reserve any remarks upon its character\nand probable antiquity for a subsequent page. It may here be observed,\nhowever, that the actual number of verses contained in it falls far short of\nthe enumeration of the Matsya, with which the Bhagavata concurs. Its actual\ncontents are not seven thousand stanzas. All the copies, and in this instance\nthey are not fewer than seven in number, procured both in the east and in the\nwest of India, agree; and there is no appearance of any part being wanting.\nThere is a beginning, a middle, and an end, in both text and comment; and the\nwork as it stands is incontestably entire. How is the discrepancy to be\nexplained?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xxi:41](vp007.htm#fr_40) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_02100.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
