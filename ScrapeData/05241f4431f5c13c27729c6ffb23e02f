This means that in that\nexperience, there will be an absence of our familiar limitations known as body\nand mind. Even the mind is for us an object of knowledge. The field of our\nknowledge can be divided into objective and subjective. Both are within the\nfield\xc2\x97both the knower and the known, the subject and the object.\n\nBuddha\'s doctrine was that only in the presence of knowing are "subject and\nobject" to be seen. Mind with its reasoning activity\xc2\x97its logic\xc2\x97generally\nconsidered as the subject, is in reality only an instrument. It does not know.\n1 Behind or beyond this mind is\n\np. 136\n\nwhat among Chinese Buddhists came to be called Essence of Mind. It is Bodhi,\nWisdom. If a man could put aside the error or delusion of the-self-as-mind\nthere would be the elimination of object and subject relation from his\nexperience, and then\xc2\x97 _nirv \xc4\x81na_.\n\nIt was always held that only man can perform this feat, because he\xc2\x97not the\nlower animals\xc2\x97has mind as _reason_. Of course, there was lower mind, or\ninstinct, in the animals, but this was accumulated knowledge\xc2\x97recognition and\nmemory. And every idea or mental picture in this store of knowledge was\naccompanied by feeling and therefore by desire. In modern terms we would call\nthis collection the subconscious mind, instinct. The sub-conscious mind could\nnot be regarded as merely a matter of bodily habit. The body is always\nchanging its particles. The incoming particles cannot be regarded as\npossessing the habits which have been learned by the outgoing particles. So\neven the continuity of its form is carried on by the "sub-conscious mind"\xc2\x97not\nby any powers of the body. This continuity governs not only the bodily\nreactions to environmental impacts, but also the emotions and flow of mental\npictures, or association of ideas. So there is instinct. Buddha called this\ncomplex of continuity the _skandhas_.\n\nMan has something more than instinct. He has reason,\n\np. 137\n\nalthough it must be admitted that very often he acts by instinct, and reason\nis often if not generally far from its maturity and power.\n\nThe height of reasoning or thinking is meditation, called _dhy \xc4\x81na_ among the\nold psychologists of India. In a boat, instinct would tell us to row, but\nreason would tell us to put up a sail, until even the putting up of a sail\npassed into the sub-conscious and reason led us further to install a motor.\nWhatever our problem, reason will improve our reaction, but reason demands\ntime\xc2\x97we must think the matter over, consider the nature of water, of boats, of\nmany things involved, study their relations in mental pictures, and then,\nafter this process, which takes time, the problem is solved. Meditation is the\ncomplete mental review of the materials of the problem and the study of their\ncombination. It is applied to ordinary material problems and to the most\nabstruse psychological and philosophical ones.\n\nBut this does not tell the whole story of meditation. If properly carried out\nit ends up with intuition\xc2\x97something you did not know before, and have not\nfound in the world. This is sometimes called _prajn \xc4\x81_. This intuition is not\nreason, but is direct perception, and the state of the mind in which this\n_prajn \xc4\x81_ or intuition is in power is called _sam \xc4\x81dhi_, which literally taken\nmeans completely in agreement or order.\n\np. 138\n\n[paragraph continues] This experience by direct perception is called in China\nand Japan a _satori_. But I am running ahead. Let us first look at the way in\nwhich the mind gets knowledge for us.\n\nMind is called "sixth sense." By mind we get to know things not available to\nthe senses of hearing, touching, seeing, tasting and smelling. It can operate\nin three stages, and usually does\xc2\x97through testimony, reasoning and seeing for\nourselves. Someone comes into the house and says there is a fire on the\nmountain; this is supported by reason, because there is smoke; then we can go\nand find the fire\xc2\x97and perhaps put it out. So there is testimony and then\nreasoning and then direct perception. This applies in religious matters.\nBuddha says he has found joy and knowledge; it is reasonable; we are to go and\nfind it.\n\nWhen the _dhy \xc4\x81na_ or meditation process was carried into China by the famous\nIndian "missionary" Bodhidharma, it came to be known as _Chan_ , and a little\nlater when it had found its way to Japan the word was further modified and\nbecame _Zen_. _Zen_ is Japanese meditation-yoga.\n\nIt is not to be thought that in either India or China the results of _dhy \xc4\x81na_\nwere merely improved subjective experience. In India the fruit of _sam \xc4\x81dhi_\nwas _viveka_ or discrimination, which means a _new valuation_. This is stated\nemphatically by Patanjali in his\n\np. 139\n\naphorism no. ii 28, which describes the final effect of the performance of the\neight Limbs of Yoga, culminating in _sam \xc4\x81dhi_. 2 This is not a perfection of\nthe subjective, but a transcendence of the subjective conception of the\nsubject-object relation. Subject and object now live together in the Knowing\nor Consciousness in a new way. Subject-self is overcome. It was a piece of\nIgnorance, a five-branched tree of ignorance.\n\nIn the case of Buddha we have exactly the same teaching, when _avidy \xc4\x81_,\nignorance, is given as the final "fetter" to be cast off, as shown in our\nprevious chapter. This was essentially ignorance or error about self or the\nsubjective entity.\n\nIt is natural that the method of practice of the _Chan_ and the _Zen_ should\nbe somewhat different from that in India, as befits the racial types of China\nand Japan. The method is well described in _The S \xc5\xabtra of Wei Lang_,\ntranslated by Wong Mou-Lam, 3 and in Christmas Humphreys\' _Zen Buddhism_ , 4\nand in several books by Professor D. T. Suzuki.\n\np. 140\n\nBefore we turn to the practices of _Zen_ it is necessary to say that the\nfundamental conceptions associated with it are also found in the old Tao-ism\nof China, coming down even from Lao Tsu, who lived about the same time as\nBuddha. Buddhism became blended with this. The difference was that Buddha\ndesired not to give a name to _nirv \xc4\x81na_, as that would almost inevitably lead\nto some mental idea of it, which would then stand in the way of the\ntranscendental experience. Even the idea of transcendence does so.\n\nIn the old teaching there was _Tao_ , the motionless, master of all, both the\nsubjective and objective sides of Nature, including man. It could equally be\ncalled the absolute motion, which, passing through every point of space in\nevery direction in every moment of time, becomes the ever-present soul of all\nmotions, but is motionless from the standpoint of the subject-object world. 5\n\nFrom _Tao_ come _yang_ and _yin_ , the active and passive sides of Nature,\nlight and shadow. In man the two elements appear as intellect and instinct.\nThe instinct-flow is natural, outward-going, but the intellect-flow, which is\n"backward-going, reversed, turned round," can become so pure that it gains\nrelease, when things are recognized but not desired. _The Secret of_\n\np. 141\n\n_the Golden Flower_ , translated by Richard Wilhelm, gives the lay-out of\nprinciples, and is a splendid source-book for this study.\n\nIntrospectively, all can see that knowledge and desire go opposite ways.\nDesire draws man into complicated experiences, bringing problems which can be\nsolved only by the intellect seeing things as they are, untainted by desires\nconcerning them. The path of yoga, in this field, thus means knowing or seeing\nwithout desire. There is, of course, knowing, or consciousness, in both cases.\nThe animal is highly conscious, but instinctual; in man the consciousness is\nbecoming intellectual; in the _bodhisattwa_ (which means one whose intellect\nis pure, or whose very nature is intellect) we have man on the verge of _nirv\n\xc4\x81na_, or _Tao_. In all three cases feeling and knowledge go hand in hand.\nWhere there is pure knowledge, the feeling is love\xc2\x97love without desire, full\nconsciousness and approach completely without antagonism. This is the _Zen_\noutlook, whatever terminology of China or India, of _Tao_ or Buddhism may be\nused. The practice of meditation in this field is "seeing without desire." And\nthe height of it is reached when there is direct perception, intuition in\nwhich reasoning stops. There is no _desire_ for logic to stop; it does so\nnaturally when its function is fulfilled; then intuition appears.\n\nIf we compare the art of China with that of Greece\n\np. 142\n\nwe find that one is more the product of imaginative observation, the other of\nintrospectional observation. The word imaginative here means image-making. It\nis less creative and more contemplative. If the poise of the Chinese has the\nrelative proportions shown in diagram A, that of the Indo-European is\nrelatively somewhat as in diagram B.\n\nIt is to be understood, of course, that while this rotary motion is the same\nfor all sane minds, the standard or evolutionary status is individual. In the\nindividual there is growth through use or exercise, whereby each of the three\nelements is advanced in ability. Taking this into consideration, it will be\nseen that the movement is spiral as well as rotary.\n\nThe difference of different minds, and races of men, is a difference in the\nproportions and status of these three. I have cited art here because art is\nyoga in action, action free from the taint of desire and utility or use. It\ngives us a peep-hole into the mind. So the meditation-systems of China did not\ndevelop on very introspectional lines, as meditation in Europe has done.\n\nIn _The Secret of the Golden Flower_ a form of meditation is given in which a\nsuperphysical self is built. Intellect or the light of seeing is to be freed\nfrom the instinctual, is to build a body of its own. This is done by stopping\nthe flight of thoughts\xc2\x97concentrate, but quickly pass into contemplation; when\ncontemplation\n\np. 143\n\n![](img/14300.jpg)\n\nIt is to be understood, of course, that while this rotary motion is the same\nfor all sane minds, the standard or evolutionary status is individual.

This "circulates" the\nprocess\xc2\x97brings it into circle, not _drives_ it round, but puts an end to\nwandering off. As in India, attention is to be given at first to the body\xc2\x97body\ncomfortable, breathing rhythmic, senses quiet. Then one listens within, to the\nno-sound, listens to the silence. Thus within the heart another "body" is\ngradually built up, which is a spiritual body.\n\nThough many details are given in _The Secret of the Golden Flower_ there is no\nroom for them here; besides, the serious student will supply his own details.\nIt is the body or focus of knowing (Confucius), of the heart-view (Buddha), of\ninward vision (Lao Tsu). The intuition will come; one must hardly ask for it,\nand certainly not presuppose its nature. The magical material side of it will\nbe that the new "body" will be the intuition-vehicle for living free from the\nspace-limitation of the body, and so, being concerned with seeing and doing\nremote from the body, giving what may be called a practical or objective side\nalso to the intuition, which is not one-sided but concerns object as well as\nsubject.\n\nBuddha said: "Nor sink the string of thought into the Fathomless." But men\ncannot leave it at that; they strive to realize the truth. Buddha does not\nobject to that, but says it will not be done by thought. Intuition which is\nnot thought will do it. But intuition comes to\n\np. 145\n\nus; we do not make it. Is it different from the objective, or different from\nthe subjective? We must answer, "No," because difference is a thought, a\ncomparison, an attribute. So not by the suppression of the world or the mind\nis intuition to be sought. Without their absence comes this something which\nthey as such cannot present. They would not be themselves without it.\nOrdinarily the mind is taken up with objective or subjective interests and\nactivities, leaving no opening for the third. When people seek that third,\nintellectual desire is usually present, even if instinctual desire has been\novercome. The first point of _Zen_ meditation is therefore, "Drop it!" Any\nmeans which will start the process and thwart the intellectual desire will be\npermissible, provided it does not prevent the "Go on" or, if there is a\nteacher, the "Come on!" which is like that of a mother calling a young child\nto walk, without a word about the mechanism of walking.\n\nThree techniques have been specially prominent in the schools of _Zen_ \xc2\x97the\nwall-gazing, the sudden question ( _mondo_ ) and the enigmatic statement (\n_koan_ ). The first is not gazing at a wall, as one might think, but gazing\nlike a wall. You are the wall, upright to the world, set by the plumb-line of\nyour own nose, unaffected, intent on the Essence of Mind. Bodhidharma is said\nto have practiced this for nine years, avoiding commitments and desires, like\nan upright\n\np. 146\n\nwall. He taught for fifty years in China. The sixth Patriarch in his\nsuccession was Hui-neng, or Wei-Lang, through whom Chinese Buddhism,\nharmonized with the _Tao_ , emerged as a definite way of life, allowing no\ndogmas, requiring an enquiring mind, searching within, demanding humble faith\nin the coming of sudden enlightenment, and\xc2\x97materially\xc2\x97a simple life of self-\nrestraint, industry and sympathy.\n\nTeachings of Buddha much used by the founders of the _Zen_ sect were: the\n_Lankavatara S \xc5\xabtra_, the _Avatansaka S \xc5\xabtra_, the _Surangama S \xc5\xabtra_, the\n_Mahayana Shraddhotp \xc4\x81da Shastra_ and the _Diamond S \xc5\xabtra_. To these were\nadded the _S \xc5\xabtra_ of Wei-Lang. The whole collection is very conveniently\ngathered together and presented in Goddard\'s _Buddhist Bible_. 6\n\nThe teaching of meditation in the _Diamond S \xc5\xabtra_ prescribes sitting alone,\nerect, motionless, quieting the mind, with attention on no definite thing,\nexcluding recollection and imagination, abandoning all notions of an external\nworld, turning to inner intuitive consciousness, gradually entering _sam\n\xc4\x81dhi_, ideal tranquility, and thus passing from vagrant thinking and even\nintellectual activity into the realization of insight.\n\nIt was especially among the Chinese and Japanese that the sudden enlightenment\nwas brought about by\n\np. 147\n\nsudden means. Intuition is by its very nature always sudden\xc2\x97not built up\xc2\x97but\nsudden means or methods were also now brought in, in the shape of _koans_ and\n_mondos_.\n\nThe _koan_ is a mind-baffling statement to be meditated upon. The teacher\nrequires an answer; there is no hurry about it, but you are expected to tackle\nit, and to stick at it until you have a solution. The statement is of such a\nnature that the intellect cannot understand it, and all its efforts to do so\nare in vain. It is thus thwarted and nullified, and the yog\xc4\xab must therefore\nsweat and strain, so to speak, with great will power until an intuitive answer\ncomes. It is very strenuous, and dangerous unless the _koan_ is given by a\ncompetent teacher to an appropriate student. The intuition is such that it\ncannot be expressed in words, but when it comes there will be a lighting-up of\nthe mind which will cause an involuntary exclamation or action, such as the\nlaugh or the slap of the thigh which one gives when there is a sudden seeing\nof the point of a joke or the solution of a conundrum, and one says, "I never\nthought of _that_."\n\nAs an example, the teacher may say: "You have knees, you have feet. Come, let\nus fly." Or, a classical one, "The two hands clap with a noise; listen to the\nclap of one hand." There should be no agreed upon,\n\np. 148\n\ntraditional or conventional meaning to these _koans_. They may be invented _ad\nlib_. A good example occurs accidentally, as it were, in the _Glorious\nPresence_ where, after expounding the Ved\xc4\x81ntic doctrine of "Not thus, not\nthus" from the commentary on the _M \xc5\xabnd\xc5\xabkya Upanishad_ where Gaudap\xc4\x81da says:\n"There is no limitation, no creation, no bondage, no maker, no aspirant,\nnobody freed\xc2\x97this is the correct knowledge," the continuation is: "And no\n\'no,\' and there we are." Another example occurred when the Sixth Patriarch\nwrote his first statement: in reply to:\n\nOur body is the Bodhi-tree,  \nAnd our mind a mirror bright.  \nCarefully we wipe them hour by hour,  \nAnd let no dust alight.\n\nHis stanza said:\n\nThere is no Bodhi-tree,  \nNor stand of a mirror bright.  \nSince all is void,  \nWhere can the dust alight?\n\nThe last two lines form a perfect _koan_.\n\nThe resulting enlightenment is called a _satori_. This "goal" as well as the\nmethod is called _Zen_ , just as in India yoga means both the practice and the\nattainment. Mr. Christmas Humphreys thus explains it: "Zen is not an escape\nfrom things but a new way of\n\np. 149\n\nlooking at things, whereby they are seen to be already in Nirvana." 7 We are\ndenying ourselves, which is the great Error. Still, one must take care not to\ncall _Zen_ or _Nirv \xc4\x81na_ a state; for that conception, or any conception, is\nwithin the _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ or error. Nor "looking."\n\nThe _mondo_ is question and answer. Here there is no continued wrestling as it\nwere in terrible unmental attentiveness, as in the case of the _koan_. An\nimmediate answer is required, without thought. It will be noticed that this is\nanother way of side-stepping the thought process while maintaining the\nattentiveness. For example, a _Zen_ master once held out a stick and said,\n"Call it not a stick; if you do you assert. Nor deny that it is a stick; if\nyou do, you negate. Without affirmation or denial, speak, speak!" It is not\nrecorded what the pupils said, but I tried this on myself and out came "On,\non!" And this carried knowledge, like a dream.\n\nLife sets us _koans_ and _mondos_ all the time, for never do we know enough to\nact with full intelligence. As far as we ourselves are concerned:\n\nAll things are rushing to their doom;  \nTrying to slow the rush  \nThe mind preserves their death.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[135:1](gsoy10.htm#fr_74) In my own terms: there is no such thing as body-\nconsciousness, and no such thing as mind-consciousness, but only, in these\ncases, consciousness of the body and consciousness of the mind.\n\n[139:2](gsoy10.htm#fr_75) For the whole subject see my _Practical Yoga:\nAncient and Modern_.
