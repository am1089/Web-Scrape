Come hither, O Vayu, thou beautiful one [1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:1:1)! These\nSomas are ready, drink of them, hear our call!\n\n2\\. O Vayu, the praisers celebrate thee with hymns, they who know the feast-\ndays [1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:2:1), and have prepared the Soma.\n\n3\\. O Vayu, thy satisfying stream [1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:3:1) goes to the\nworshipper, wide-reaching, to the Soma-draught.\n\n4\\. O Indra and Vayu, these (libations of Soma) are poured out; come hither\nfor the sake of [1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:4:1) our offerings, for the drops (of\nSoma) long for you.\n\n5\\. O Indra and Vayu, you perceive the libations, you who are rich in booty\n[1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:5:1); come then quickly hither!\n\n6\\. O Vayu and Indra, come near to the work [1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:6:1) of the\nsacrificer, quick, thus is my prayer [2](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:6:2), O ye men!\n\n7\\. I call Mitra, endowed with holy strength [1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:7:1), and\nVaru _n_ a, who destroys all enemies; who both fulfil a prayer accompanied by\nfat offerings [2](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:7:2).\n\n8\\. On the right way, O Mitra and Varu _n_ a, you have obtained great wisdom,\nyou who increase the right and adhere to the right\n[1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:8:1);\n\n9\\. These two sages, Mitra and Varu _n_ a, the mighty, wide-ruling, give us\nefficient strength.\n\np. 441\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Madhu _k_ _kh_ andas Vai _s_ vamitra, and addressed to Vayu (1-3),\nIndra and Vayu (4-6), and to Mitra and Varu _n_ a (7-9). Metre, Gayatri. Verse\n4 = VS. VII, 8; XXXIII, 56; TS. I, 4, 4, 1; MS. I. 3, 6. Verse 7 = SV. II,\n197; VS. XXXIII, 57: Verse 8 = SV. II, 198. Verse 9 = SV. II, 199.\n\nThis hymn, with the hymn I, 3, belongs to the Pra-uga ceremony. It consists of\nthree t _ri_ _k_ as.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Dar _s_ ata, as applied to the wind, may be intended for visible, but\nits more general meaning is conspicuous, clarus, insignis.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Aharvid, which Benfey translates by tagekundig, Grassmann, die des\nTages (Anbruch) kundig, seems to have two meanings. When applied to men, poets\nor priests, it means those who know (vid) the right days or seasons for every\nsacrifice, but when it is applied to certain deities, particularly those of\nthe morning, it means finding (vind), bringing back the day, like lucifer.\nThus the A _s_ vins are called aharvida (VIII, 5, 9; 21). The power (daksha)\nof Vish _n_ u is called aharvid, conquering, or bringing, the light of the day\n(I, 156, 4). The priests, as inviting these gods, might possibly themselves be\ncalled aharvid, bringing back the light of day, but this seems doubtful.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. This verse, though it seems easy, is really full of difficulties. The\nmeaning of dhena is very doubtful. It is explained as lips by native\nauthorities, and would in that case be derived from dhe, to suck. But though\nthis meaning is possible in some passages, particularly where dhene occurs in\nthe dual, in other passages dhena seems clearly to\n\np. 442\n\nmean a stream of milk, or of some other liquid, poured out (vis _ri_ sh _t_ a)\nfrom the clouds or at a sacrifice. It often occurs in the dual dhene, and has\nthen been taken as the upper and lower lips (not the nares, as Roth suggests),\ndistinguished from _s_ ipre, the upper and lower jaws. See note on II, 34, 3.\nSaya _n_ a (Rv. Bh. I, 101, 10) explains it by _g_ ihvopa _g_ ihvike. Durga\nadds (Nirukta Bhashya, VI, 17) adhastye da _m_ sh _t_ re va _g_ ihvopa _g_\nihvike va, ity eke, tayor hy anna _m_ dhiyate.\n\nBenfey translates: 'Vayu, deine vorkostende Lippe schreitet zum Opferer, weit\nhingestreckt zum Somatrank.' Prap _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ati can hardly mean vorkostend.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The instrumental prayobhi _h_ is best translated here by 'for the sake\nof;' see Wenzel, Instrumental, p. 104.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. On va _g_ ini and va _g_ a, see 'India, what can it teach us?' pp.\n164, 166. The transition of meaning from va _g_ a, booty, to va _g_ a, wealth\nin general, finds an analogy in the German kriegen, to obtain, also in Gewinn,\nand A. S. winnan, to strive, to fight, to obtain. Va _g_ inivasu, in the dual,\nis a frequent epithet of the A _s_ vins, II, 37, 5; V, 74, 6; 7; 75, 3; 78, 3;\nVIII, 5, 3; 12; 20; 8, 10; 9, 4; 10, 5; 22, 7; 14; 18; 26, 3; 85, 3; 101, 8;\nof Indra, III, 42, 5; X, 96, 8.\n\nIt differs little from va _g_ inivat, which is likewise applied to the A _s_\nvins, I, 120, 10, and comes to mean simply wealthy, liberal; cf. I, 122, 8;\nVII, 69, 1. Va _g_ inivati is an epithet of Ushas, Sarasvati, and Sindhu. A\ncommon phrase is va\xc2\xb4 _g_ ebhi _h_ va _g_ inivati, lit. wealthy in wealth, cf.\nI, 3, 10. Va _g_ ini occurs as the feminine of va _g_ in, wealthy, or strong,\nbut never in the sense of mare; cf. III, 61, 1. usha _h_ va\xc2\xb4 _g_ ena va _g_\nini, Ushas wealthy by wealth or booty; VI, 61, 6. Sarasvati va\xc2\xb4geshu va _g_\nini, Sarasvati, strong in battles; cf. I, 4, 8; 9. Native commentators\ngenerally explain va _g_ ini by sacrifice, va _g_ inivasu, by dwelling in the\nsacrifice. I take va _g_ ini in compounds like va _g_ inivasu as a collective\n\np. 443\n\nsubstantive, like padmini, uhini, vahini, tretini, anikini, &c., and in the\nsense of wealth; unless we may look upon va _g_ inivat as formed in analogy to\nsuch words as tavishi-mat, only that in this case tavishi exists in the sense\nof strength. Pischel's explanation, Ved. Stud. p. 9, rich in mares, takes for\ngranted the existence of va _g_ ini in the sense of mare. I have not found any\npassage where va _g_ ini has necessarily that sense.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Nishk _ri_ ta can hardly mean here what it means in later Sanskrit, a\nrendezvous.\n\nNote 2. On ittha\xc2\xb4 dhiya\xc2\xb4, see Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 184.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Putadaksha, cf. putakratu, VIII, 68, 17.\n\nNote 2. Gh _ri_ ta _k_ i seems to be taken here in a technical sense, like gh\n_ri_ tavat, i. e. with oblations of butter thrown into the fire. In I, 167, 3,\nI took gh _ri_ ta _k_ i in the more general sense of bright, resplendent,\nwhile others ascribed to it the meaning of bringing fatness, i. e. rain. It\nmay also mean accompanied by ghee. See B.-R. s. v.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. _Ri_ tasp _r i_ _s_ , probably not very different from _ri_ tasa\xc2\xb4p.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 134.
