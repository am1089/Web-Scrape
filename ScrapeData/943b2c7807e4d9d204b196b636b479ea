But those (meditations) which are connected with members (of sacrifices)\nare not (restricted) to (particular) _s_ akhas, but rather (belong) to all _s_\nakhas.\n\np. 676\n\nThere are certain meditations connected with certain constituent elements of\nsacrifices-as e.g. 'Let a man meditate on the syllable Om (as) the Udgitha '(\n_Kh._ Up. I, 1, 1); 'Let a man meditate on the fivefold Saman as the five\nworlds' ( _Kh._ Up. II, 2, 1), &c. The question here arises whether those\nmeditations are restricted to the members of those _s_ akhas in whose texts\nthey are mentioned; or to be connected with the Udgitha, and so on, in all _s_\nakhas. There is here a legitimate ground for doubt, in so far as, although the\ngeneral agreement of all Vedanta-texts is established, the Udgitha, and so on,\nare different in each Veda since the accents differ in the different Vedas--\nThe Purvapakshin declares that those meditations are limited each to its\nparticular _s_ akha; for, he says, the injunction 'Let him meditate on the\nUdgitha' does indeed, verbally, refer to the Udgitha in general; but as what\nstands nearest to this injunction is the special Udgitha of the _s_ akha, in\nwhose text this injunction occurs, and which shares the peculiarities of\naccent characteristic of that _s_ akha, we decide that the meditation is\nenjoined on members of that _s_ akha only.--The Sutra sets this opinion aside.\nThe injunction of meditations of this type is valid for all _s_ akhas, since\nthe text expressly connects them with the Udgitha in general. They therefore\nhold good wherever there is an Udgitha. The individual Udgithas of the several\n_s_ akhas are indeed distinguished by different accentuation; but the general\nstatement, 'Let him meditate on the Udgitha.' suggests to the mind not any\nparticular Udgitha, but _the_ Udgitha in general, and hence there is no reason\nto restrict the meditation to a particular _s_ akha. From the principle\nmoreover that all _s_ akhas teach the same doctrine, it follows that the\nsacrifice enjoined in the different _s_ akhas is one only; and hence there is\nno reason to hold that the Udgitha suggested by the injunction of the\nmeditation is a particular one. For the Udgitha is only an element in the\nsacrifice, and the sacrifice is one and the same. The meditations are not\ntherefore limited to particular _s_ akhas.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 54.
