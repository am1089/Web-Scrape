Having tied the girdle round him and given him the staff, he should impose\nthe (observances of the) Brahma _k_ arya on him\xc2\x97\n\n2\\. (With the words), \'A Brahma _k_ arin thou art. Eat water. Do the service.\nDo not sleep in the day-time. Devoted to the teacher study the Veda.\'\n\n3\\. Twelve years lasts the Brahma _k_ arya for (each) Veda, or until he has\nlearnt it.\n\n4\\. Let him beg (food) in the evening and in the morning.\n\n5\\. Let him put fuel on (the fire) in the evening and in the morning.\n\n6\\. Let him beg first of a man who will not refuse,\n\n7\\. Or of a woman who will not refuse.\n\n8\\. (In begging he should use the words), \'Sir, give food!\'\n\n9 9. Or, \'(Sir, give) Anuprava _k_ aniya (food).\'\n\n10 10. That (which he has received) he should announce to his teacher.\n\n11\\. He should stand the rest of the day.\n\n12 12. After sunset (the student) should cook the Brahmaudana (or boiled rice\nwith which the Brahma _n_ as are to be fed) for the Anuprava _k_ aniya\nsacrifice (the sacrifice to be performed after a part of the Veda has been\nstudied), and should announce to the teacher (that it is ready).\n\np. 192\n\n13\\. The teacher should sacrifice, while the student takes hold of him, with\nthe verse, \'The wonderful lord of the abode\' (Rig-Veda I, 18, 6).\n\n14\\. A second time with the Savitri\xc2\x97\n\n15 15. And whatever else has been studied afterwards.\n\n16\\. A third time to the _Ri_ shis.\n\n17\\. A fourth time (the oblation) to (Agni) Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n18 18. Having given food to the Brahma _n_ as he should cause them to\npronounce the end of the Veda (study).\n\n19\\. From that time (the student) should eat no saline food; he should observe\nchastity, and should sleep on the ground through three nights, or twelve\nnights, or one year.\n\n20 20. When he has fulfilled those observances, (the teacher) performs (for\nhim) the \'production of intelligence,\' (in the following way):\n\n21 21. While (the student) towards an unobjectionable direction (of the\nhorizon) sprinkles thrice (water) from the left to the right with a water-pot\nround a\n\np. 193\n\n[paragraph continues] Pala _s_ a (tree) with one root, or round a Ku _s_ a\nbunch, if there is no Pala _s_ a, (the teacher) causes him to say, \'O glorious\none, thou art glorious. As thou, O glorious one, art glorious, thus, O\nglorious one, lead me to glory. As thou art the preserver of the treasure of\nsacrifice for the gods, thus may I become the preserver of the treasure of the\nVeda for men.\'\n\n22 22. Thereby, beginning with his having the hair cut, and ending with the\ngiving in charge, the imposing of observances has been declared.\n\n23\\. Thus for one who has not been initiated before.\n\n24\\. Now as regards one who has been initiated before:\n\n25 25. The cutting of the hair is optional,\n\n26 26. And the \'production of intelligence.\'\n\n27 27. On the giving in charge there are no express rules (in this case);\n\n28 28. And on the time.\n\n29 29. (He should recite to him) as the Savitri (the _Ri_ _k_ ),\'That we\nchoose of god Savit _ri_ \' (Rig-veda V, 82, 1).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[191:9](sbe29121.htm#fr_458) 22, 9.
