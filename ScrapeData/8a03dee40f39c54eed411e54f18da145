'Mind (manas) is better than speech. For as the closed fist holds two\namalaka or two kola or two aksha fruits, thus does mind hold speech and name.\nFor if a man is minded in his mind to read the sacred hymns, he reads them; if\nhe is minded in his mind to perform any actions, he performs them; if he is\nminded to wish for sons and cattle, he wishes for them; if he is minded to\nwish for this world and the other, he wishes for them. For mind is indeed the\nself 1, mind is the world, mind is Brahman. Meditate on the mind.\n\n2\\. 'He who meditates on the mind as Brahman, is, as it were, lord and master\nas far as the mind reaches--he who meditates on the mind as Brahman.'\n\n'Sir, is there something better than mind?'\n\n'Yes, there is something better than mind.'\n\n'Sir, tell it me.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[112:1](sbe01137.htm#fr_305) The commentator explains this by saying that,\nwithout the instrument of the mind, the Self cannot act or enjoy.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 4](sbe01138.htm)\n\n"
