Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya had two wives, Maitreyi and Katyayani. Of these\nMaitreyi was conversant with Brahman, but Katyayani possessed such knowledge\nonly as women possess. And Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, when he wished to get ready for\nanother state of life (when he wished to give up the state of a householder,\nand retire into the forest),\n\n2\\. Said, 'Maitreyi, verily I am going away from this my house (into the\nforest). Forsooth, let me make a settlement between thee and that Katyayani.'\n\n3\\. Maitreyi said: 'My Lord, if this whole earth, full of wealth, belonged to\nme, tell me, should I be immortal by it, or no?'\n\n'No,' replied Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, 'like the life of rich people will be thy\nlife. But there is no hope of immortality by wealth.'\n\n4\\. And Maitreyi said: 'What should I do with that by which I do not become\nimmortal? What my Lord knoweth 3 (of immortality), tell that clearly to me.'\n\n5\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: 'Thou who art truly dear to me, thou hast\nincreased what is dear (to me in\n\np. 182\n\nthee) 1. Therefore, if you like, Lady, I will explain it to thee, and mark\nwell what I say.'\n\n6\\. And he said: 'Verily, a husband is not dear, that you may love the\nhusband; but that you may love the Self, therefore a husband is dear.\n\n'Verily, a wife is not dear, that you may love the wife; but that you may love\nthe Self, therefore a wife is dear.\n\n'Verily, sons are not dear, that you may love the sons; but that you may love\nthe Self, therefore sons are dear.\n\n'Verily, wealth is not dear, that you may love wealth; but that you may love\nthe Self, therefore wealth is dear.\n\n'Verily, cattle 2 are not dear, that you may love cattle; but that you may\nlove the Self, therefore cattle are dear.\n\n'Verily, the Brahman-class is not dear, that you may love the Brahman-class;\nbut that you may love the Self, therefore the Brahman-class is dear.\n\n'Verily, the Kshatra-class is not dear, that you may love the Kshatra-class;\nbut that you may love the Self, therefore the Kshatra-class is dear.\n\n'Verily, the worlds are not dear, that you may love the worlds; but that you\nmay love the Self, therefore the worlds are dear.\n\n'Verily, the Devas are not dear, that you may love the Devas; but that you may\nlove the Self, therefore the Devas are dear.\n\np. 183\n\n'Verily, the Vedas are not dear, that you may love the Vedas; but that you may\nlove the Self, therefore the Vedas are dear.\n\n'Verily, creatures are not dear, that you may love the creatures; but that you\nmay love the Self, therefore are creatures dear.\n\n'Verily, everything is not dear, that you may love everything; but that you\nmay love the Self, therefore everything is dear.\n\n'Verily, the Self is to be seen, to be heard, to be perceived, to be marked, O\nMaitreyi! When the Self has been seen, heard, perceived, and known, then all\nthis is known!\n\n7\\. 'Whosoever looks for the Brahman-class elsewhere than in the Self, was\nabandoned by the Brahman-class. Whosoever looks for the Kshatra-class\nelsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the Kshatra-class. Whosoever\nlooks for the worlds elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the worlds.\nWhosoever looks for the Devas elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the\nDevas. Whosoever looks for the Vedas elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned\nby the Vedas. Whosoever looks for the creatures elsewhere than in the Self,\nwas abandoned by the creatures. Whosoever looks for anything elsewhere than in\nthe Self, was abandoned by anything.\n\n'This Brahman-class, this Kshatra-class, these worlds, these Devas, these\nVedas, all these beings, this everything, all is that Self.\n\n8\\. 'Now as the sounds of a drum, when beaten, cannot be seized externally (by\nthemselves), but the sound is seized, when the drum is seized, or the beater\nof the drum;\n\np. 184\n\n9\\. 'And as the sounds of a conch-shell, when blown, cannot be seized\nexternally (by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the shell is seized,\nor the blower of the shell;\n\n10\\. 'And as the sounds of a lute, when played, cannot be seized externally\n(by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the lute is seized, or the\nplayer of the lute;\n\n11\\. 'As clouds of smoke proceed by themselves out of lighted fire kindled\nwith damp fuel, thus verily, O Maitreyi, has been breathed forth from this\ngreat Being what we have as _Ri_ g-veda, Ya _g_ ur-veda, Sama-veda,\nAtharva\xe1\xb9\x85girasas, Itihasa, Pura _n_ a, Vidya, the Upanishads, _S_ lokas,\nSutras, Anuvyakhyanas, Vyakhyanas, what is sacrificed, what is poured out,\nfood, drink 1, this world and the other world, and all creatures. From him\nalone all these were breathed forth.\n\n12\\. 'As all waters find their centre in the sea, all touches in the skin, all\ntastes in the tongue, all smells in the nose, all colours in the eye, all\nsounds in the ear, all percepts in the mind, all- knowledge in the heart, all\nactions in the hands, all movements in the feet, and all the Vedas in\nspeech,--\n\n13\\. 'As a mass of salt has neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a\nmass of taste, thus indeed has that Self neither inside nor outside, but is\naltogether a mass of knowledge; and having risen from out these elements,\nvanishes again in them. When he has departed, there is no more knowledge\n(name), I say, O Maitreyi,'--thus spoke Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\n\np. 185\n\n14\\. Then Maitreyi said: 'Here, Sir, thou hast landed me in utter\nbewilderment. Indeed, I do not understand him.'\n\nBut he replied: 'O Maitreyi, I say nothing that is bewildering. Verily,\nbeloved, that Self is imperishable, and of an indestructible nature.\n\n15\\. 'For when there is as it were duality, then one sees the other, one\nsmells the other, one tastes the other, one salutes the other, one hears the\nother, one perceives the other, one touches the other, one knows the other;\nbut when the Self only is all this, how should he see another, how should he\nsmell another, how should he taste another, how should he salute another, how\nshould he hear another, how should he touch another, how should he know\nanother? How should he know Him by whom he knows all this? That Self is to be\ndescribed by No, no [1](sbe15078.htm#fn_544)! He is incomprehensible, for he\ncannot be comprehended; he is imperishable, for he cannot perish; he is\nunattached, for he does not attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he\ndoes not fail. How, O beloved, should he know the Knower? Thus, O Maitreyi,\nthou hast been instructed. Thus far goes immortality.' Having said so, Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya went away (into the forest).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[181:2](sbe15077.htm#fr_539) See before, II, 4.\n\n[181:3](sbe15077.htm#fr_540) The Ka _n_ va text has vettha instead of veda.\n\n[182:1](sbe15077.htm#fr_541) The Ka _n_ va text has av _ri_ dhat, which _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains by vardhitavati nirdharitavaty asi.
