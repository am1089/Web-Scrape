(The system) of the Lord (must be disregarded), on account of\ninappropriateness.\n\nSo far it has been shown that the doctrines of Kapila, Ka _n_ ada, Sugata, and\nthe Arhat must be disregarded by men desirous of final beatitude; for those\ndoctrines are all alike untenable and foreign to the Veda. The Sutras now\ndeclare that, for the same reasons, the doctrine of Pa _s_ upati also has to\nbe disregarded. The adherents of this view belong to four different classes--\nKapalas, Kalamukhas, Pa _s_ upatas, and _S_ aivas. All of them hold fanciful\ntheories of Reality which are in conflict with the Veda, and invent various\nmeans for attaining happiness in this life and the next. They maintain the\ngeneral material cause and the operative cause to be distinct, and the latter\ncause to be constituted by Pa _s_ upati. They further hold the wearing of the\nsix so-called 'mudra' badges and the like to be means to accomplish the\nhighest end of man.\n\nThus the Kapalas say, 'He who knows the true nature of the six mudras, who\nunderstands the highest mudra, meditating on himself as in the position called\nbhagasana, reaches Nirva _n_ a. The necklace, the golden ornament, the\n\np. 521\n\nearring, the head-jewel, ashes, and the sacred thread are called the six\nmudras. He whose body is marked with these is not born here again.'--Similarly\nthe Kalamukhas teach that the means for obtaining all desired results in this\nworld as well as the next are constituted by certain practices--such as using\na skull as a drinking vessel, smearing oneself with the ashes of a dead body,\neating the flesh of such a body, carrying a heavy stick, setting up a liquor-\njar and using it as a platform for making offerings to the gods, and the like.\n'A bracelet made of Rudraksha-seeds on the arm, matted hair on the head, a\nskull, smearing oneself with ashes, &c.'--all this is well known from the\nsacred writings of the Saivas. They also hold that by some special ceremonial\nperformance men of different castes may become Brahma _n_ as and reach the\nhighest a _s_ rama: 'by merely entering on the initiatory ceremony (diksha) a\nman becomes a Brahma _n_ a at once; by undertaking the kapala rite a man\nbecomes at once an ascetic.'\n\nWith regard to these views the Sutra says 'of pati, on account of\ninappropriateness.' A 'not' has here to be supplied from Sutra 32. The system\nof Pa _s_ upati has to be disregarded because it is inappropriate, i.e.\nbecause the different views and practices referred to are opposed to one\nanother and in conflict with the Veda. The different practices enumerated\nabove, the wearing of the six mudras and so on, are opposed to each other; and\nmoreover the theoretical assumptions of those people, their forms of devotion\nand their practices, are in conflict with the Veda. For the Veda declares that\nNaraya _n_ a who is the highest Brahman is alone the operative and the\nsubstantial cause of the world, 'Naraya _n_ a is the highest Brahman, Naraya\n_n_ a is the highest Reality, Naraya _n_ a is the highest light, Naraya _n_ a\nis the highest Self'; 'That thought, may I be many, may I grow forth' ( _Kh_.\nUp. VI, 2, 3); 'He desired, may I be many, may I grow forth' (Taitt. Up. II,\n6, 1), and so on. In the same way the texts declare meditation on the Supreme\nPerson, who is the highest Brahman, to be the only meditation which effects\nfinal release; cp. 'I know that great Person of sunlike lustre beyond the\n\np. 522\n\ndarkness. A man who knows him passes over death; there is no other path to go'\n( _S_ vet. Up. III, 8). And in the same way all texts agree in declaring that\nthe works subserving the knowledge of Brahman are only those sacrificial and\nother works which the Veda enjoins on men in the different castes and stages\nof life: 'Him Brahma _n_ as seek to know by the study of the Veda, by\nsacrifice, by gifts, by penance, by fasting. Wishing for that world only,\nmendicants wander forth from their homes' (B _ri_. Up. XI, 4, 22). In some\ntexts enjoining devout meditation, and so on, we indeed meet with terms such\nas Pra _g_ apati, _S_ iva, Indra, \xc3\x82ka _s_ a, Pra _n_ a, &c., but that these\nall refer to the supreme Reality established by the texts concerning Naraya\n_n_ a--the aim of which texts it is to set forth the highest Reality in its\npurity--, we have already proved under I, 1, 30. In the same way we have\nproved under Su. I, 1, 2 that in texts treating of the creation of the world,\nsuch as 'Being only this was in the beginning,' and the like, the words\n_Being_ , _Brahman_ , and so on, denote nobody else but Naraya _n_ a, who is\nset forth as the universal creator in the account of creation given in the\ntext, 'Alone indeed there was Naraya _n_ a, not Brahma, not I _s_ ana--he\nbeing alone did not rejoice' (Mahopanishad I).--As the Pa _s_ upati theory\nthus teaches principles, meditations and acts conflicting with the Veda, it\nmust be disregarded.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 37.
