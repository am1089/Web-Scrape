And should a state of consciousness--although directly\n\np. 40\n\napprehended as implying difference--be determined by some fallacious reasoning\nto be devoid of difference, this determination could be effected only by means\nof some special attributes additional to the quality of mere Being; and owing\nto these special qualities on which the determination depends, that state of\nconsciousness would clearly again be characterised by difference. The meaning\nof the mentioned determination could thus only be that of a thing affected\nwith certain differences some other differences are denied; but manifestly\nthis would not prove the existence of a thing free from all difference. To\nthought there at any rate belongs the quality of being thought and self-\nilluminatedness, for the knowing principle is observed to have for its\nessential nature the illumining (making to shine forth) of objects. And that\nalso in the states of deep sleep, swoon, &c., consciousness is affected with\ndifference we shall prove, in its proper place, in greater detail. Moreover\nyou yourself admit that to consciousness there actually belong different\nattributes such as permanency (oneness, self-luminousness, &c.), and of these\nit cannot be shown that they are only Being in general. And even if the latter\npoint were admitted, we observe that there takes place a discussion of\ndifferent views, and you yourself attempt to prove your theory by means of the\ndifferences between those views and your own. It therefore must be admitted\nthat reality is affected with difference well established by valid means of\nproof.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sabda proves difference](sbe48010.htm)\n\n"
