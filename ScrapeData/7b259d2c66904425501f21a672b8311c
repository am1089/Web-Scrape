There will be\nno devotional feeling towards what is not good. If some persons were to\nworship or rather propitiate a dangerous deity it would not be devotion. So\ndevotion implies goodness and is towards goodness. It is a form of love, but\nessentially love of something or some person who is "good."\n\nMerchants, who speak of goods, not of mere things or articles, are in this\nparticular excellent psychologists. Goods are things which are good for us, or\nwe might better put it, good to us. We go further as our intelligence or\nknowledge increases and recognize that some things which are not good to us\nare good to others. "The farmer prays for rain, the washerman for sun," says\nthe Japanese proverb. On\n\np. 110\n\nthis basis, everything is seen to be good because everything is good to some\nbeing.\n\nWhen men ask themselves where all these goods come from they easily ascribe\nthem to a goodness which has the nature of a superior mind. They find that the\ngood man is one who positively produces goods of some kind and passes them on\nto others. Not only the things he produces but he himself is thus a\nmanifestation of goodness. From such thoughts it is easy to pass on to the\nidea of a deity or deity who is goodness, and, in the height of this idea, is\ngood to all and always, even when the goodness of his gift of the moment is\nnot understood and felt as such. In this way the intellect permits the\ngoodness to be universalized, and prevents the judgment of goodness from being\nbased on one\'s own personal pleasure or one\'s own material welfare. Thus\ndevotion, which arises at first from the reception of some goods, ends up by\ndeclaring that all is good, and this devotion then makes logical a\npredisposition towards appreciative feelings, even when there is not\nunderstanding.\n\nThat is true and complete religious devotion, which never questions but always\nappreciates everything, or judges all things and their Giver as expressions\nand sources of that goodness. In the West philosophers have said that it is\npossible to get good out of every experience, so one should "look for the\n\np. 111\n\ngood in everything"; but in India they always went one better than that by\nsaying one should "look for the God in everything," because in this way the\nfeelings as well as the intellect had their play. In looking for the good in\neverything there is usually a somewhat antagonistic feeling. This philosopher\nsays he will face all situations boldly and extract some good from them. But\nin accepting the God in everything there is a glad meeting and full\nattentiveness and openness of heart. It is a perfectly happy condition, in\nwhich the poet could say:\n\nHither! take me, use me, fill me,  \nVein and artery, though ye kill me!\n\nAnother way of approaching a knowledge of the heart of the devotee is to ask\noneself where the philosopher gets his truth, which is a good. Did he make it?\nNo, he found it. Where did the artist get his beauty? Did he make it? No, he\nfound it. Since it takes the best and greatest men merely to find these goods\nand present them to others in, at best, an imperfect form, what shall be\nthought of the original Cause of all the truths and beauties? We naturally bow\nwith great joy before the thought of that Cause.\n\nThe _bhakta_ or devotee is satisfied with the joy of the consciousness of the\npresence of Goodness. But he still has also a touch of philosophy\xc2\x97the thought\nthat his own joyous devotion\xc2\x97imperfect as he knows\n\np. 112\n\nit to be and rejoiceful as he is that he has even a little of it, and perhaps\neven then only sometimes\xc2\x97will ultimately increase to fill the whole of his\nlife and then be present at all times. Thus devotion is itself another good,\nand a source of joy.\n\nIt is only one step more to the formation of _bhakti-yoga_ , a method for\nincreasing the _bhakti_. Religious services are usually a mixture of this with\nwhat we shall presently study as the mantra-yoga. They aim at the direction of\nthe feelings, and mix it with ceremonial words and actions. In India there is\nno collective or congregational worship, but still there are occasional\ngatherings at which stories are told and songs are sung extolling the exploits\nof divine Incarnations, or there is singing the names or appellations of\nDeity. In country places there are often _bhajanas_ in which songs are sung\ncontaining mostly the names of the deities, to the accompaniment of drums and\nmusic, before a statue or a picture representing the divinity. Individual\nworship appears in daily prayers and in yoga practice.\n\nWhy is a separate or outside God adored, reverenced, worshipped? Because he is\nregarded as the source of wealth and bounty, considered either as an example,\nor as a giver of material benefits, or at least of divine "grace." It is a\nquestion whether the r\xc4\x81ja-yog\xc4\xab could allow himself this form of devotion,\nwhich leans on "goodness." The goal of his being is upright,\n\np. 113\n\nstrong life, happy and free because it is illuminated as to _its own_ divine\nnature and that of _all_ the other lives seen around, using other forms. If,\nthen, his goal of life is this happiness, which is the joy of upright, strong\nlife, master of its own small world of body and circumstances, how can he look\nfor help towards that freedom at any stage by what he would call the\nintoxications or consolations or refuges of religion? Let a man do his small\ndaily task according to his strength of will, love and thought, and all will\nbe well with him. He can be immensely devoted to all the life around him,\nregarding his neighbor as himself. His refuge from selfishness and the fear it\nbrings exists, but he will not bring into it the unnatural considerations of\nanother and separate life governing or uplifting his own. To him this devotion\nis a _hatha-yoga_ , inasmuch as it depends on another "good," external to\nhimself. Therefore this devotion is often found along with the _hatha_ schools\nof yoga. It comes in also along with concentration in the various _chakras_.\nThe _Gheranda Sanhit \xc4\x81_ mentions it as one of the means to _sam \xc4\x81dhi_: "Let\nhim meditate in his own heart upon the proper form of his desired deity; let\nhim meditate with the _bhakti-yoga_ , full of the greatest gladness; let him\nshed tears of happiness." 1\n\nThe flow of unrestrained feeling, even if it means\n\np. 114\n\nself-abandonment before the recognized glory of the divine, also has its\ndangers if not balanced by thought and knowledge, as insane asylums testify\nall over the Western world, and a red record of fanaticism and cruelty\nwitnesses in history; though it is a path that may be followed without special\nguidance, provided the development of intelligence and will in practical life\nis not neglected. Many churches and other organizations are busy on this line,\nbut for the most part they miss the point of it because they direct attention\nto God or his representative as something for the weakling to lean upon or as\na fountain of blessing for personal gratification, rather than as something so\nsplendid\xc2\x97a Good beyond all goods\xc2\x97that at the mere sight of it one loses\npersonal desires completely, forgets oneself in the contemplation of it, and\nadds a new form of ecstasy to the permanent treasures of the soul.\n\nFrom the Hindu point of view there is an error in the Western idea that grace\ncan come down from above in response to devotion, or, still worse, that higher\nforces can be brought down by it and by ceremonials. Their view is that by\ngrace we are lifted up, not that anything is brought down. It is akin to the\ndoctrine of intuition. If there is intuition, following upon much thought on a\ngiven subject, the field of thought is clarified. Yoga, however, aims at the\nraising of consciousness above the mind into the\n\np. 115\n\nclarifier. A crude simile may make this clear; a man owns a car, looks after\nit and drives it along the road to some destination, and because of that the\ncar is both preserved and used. If the car were left to itself it would rot.\nOr if it were started up and sent off by itself it would soon meet with an\naccident. But when it is properly used, the car is still a car; it does not\nbecome a man, and the man is still a man and does not become a car. So with\nthe mind. If left to itself it will rot or produce an accident. But what is\nabove mind\xc2\x97the ethical and moral principles\xc2\x97will preserve it and use it well,\nwill harmonize its parts and contents and illumine its path. All are glad of\nthe intuition, but the yog\xc4\xab wants more than that\xc2\x97his consciousness must be\nraised into the very source of that intuition. One is speaking of the _bhakta_\n, who is to be himself raised up, not to have his material nature glorified.\n\nThe use of _mantras_ constitutes another very definite department of occult\npractices, known in India from the oldest times. _Mantras_ are charms, spells,\nmagical formulas, incantations. _Mantra-yoga_ is the employment of words so\narranged as to produce these effects. It is not usually considered that\nordinary people are qualified to make _mantras_ , but that the _mantra-yog \xc4\xab_\nis a person who knows the _mantras_ which have been made by great _mantra-k\n\xc4\x81ras_ ( _mantra_ -makers) in the past. All the hymns of the Vedas are called\n_mantras_ ;\n\np. 116\n\nthose which are metrical and meant to be recited loudly are called " _rich_ "\n(hence _Rig-Veda_ ), those in prose and to be uttered in a low voice are\ncalled " _yajus_ " (hence _Yajur-Veda_ ) and the metrical ones intended for\nchanting are called _s \xc4\x81man_ (hence _S \xc4\x81ma-Veda_). Mantras are formularies\nwhich are meant to produce an effect on people and sometimes on things, which\nwill be so affected that they would then affect people. Thus, for example,\n_mantras_ are useful for consecrating shrines, instruments, vestments and\nother things. People of Western countries are familiar with the idea, as it\noccurs not only in their stories or folk-lore about wizards and witches, but\nalso in the practices of some of the churches, in which it is imperative that\nthe priest shall conduct the ceremonies with the words exactly as prescribed,\nand shall also wear the vestments and make the gestures or movements\ntraditionally associated with them and use the instruments according to rule.\n\nIt is to be noted that the prescribed wording and chanting must be accompanied\nby the right intention and belief in the mind. The _mantra_ is not supposed to\nbe effective without the thought which is called the intent or purpose;\nnevertheless the incantator need not know the meaning of the words employed\xc2\x97it\nmakes no difference to the mantric action whether he knows them or not. But\nthe correct _intention_ must\n\np. 117\n\nbe used with the _mantra_ belonging to it. This implies that one cannot use a\n_mantra_ for any purpose other than that originally intended. It also\nindicates that the use of _mantras_ is not passive (such as that of prayer-\nwheels or prayer-flags), but they are considered as tools. Thus the\nreproduction of a recited _mantra_ by gramophone record would have no effect\nbeyond that of its mere sound or music.\n\nThere are many different _mantras_ associated with different schools of\nactivity. But in all of them the chief feature is the repetition ( _japa_ ) of\ncertain fixed forms of words, often with a definite intonation, and always\nwith the thought of their meaning and intention. We find this practice\nfrequently combined with _bhakti-yoga_ , as in the following example, from the\n_Gop \xc4\x81lat\xc4\x81pani Upanishad_ and the _Krishna Upanishad_. Of all the mantras of\nShr\xc4\xab Krishna, none is considered more powerful than this five-divisioned,\neighteen-syllabled one, which is: "Kl\xc4\xabm, Krishn\xc4\x81ya, Govind\xc4\x81ya, Gop\xc4\xab-jana,\nVallabh\xc4\x81ya, Sw\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81!" The following is the explanation, translated in my book on\nConcentration:\n\n"Once the sages came to the great Brahma and asked: \'Who is the supreme God?\nWhom does Death fear? Through the knowledge of what does all become known?\nWhat makes this world continue on its course?\'\n\n"He replied: \'Shr\xc4\xab Krishna verily is the supreme God. Death is afraid of\nGovinda (Shr\xc4\xab Krishna). By knowledge\n\np. 118\n\nof the Lord of Gop\xc4\xab-jana (Shr\xc4\xab Krishna) the whole is known. By Sw\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81 the world\ngoes on evolving.\'\n\n"Then they questioned him again: \'Who is Krishna? Who is Govinda? Who is the\nLord of Gop\xc4\xab-jana? What is Sw\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81?\'\n\n"He replied: \'Krishna is he who destroys all wrong. Govinda is the knower of\nall things, who, on earth, is known through the great teaching. The Lord of\nGop\xc4\xab-jana is he who guides all conditioned beings. Sw\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81 is his power. He who\nmeditates on these, repeats the _mantra_ , and worships him, becomes\nimmortal.\'\n\n"Again they asked him: \'What is his form? What is his _mantra_? What is his\nworship?\'\n\n"He replied: \'He who has the form of a protector of cows. The cloud-colored\nyouth. He who sits at the root of the tree. He whose eyes are like the full-\nblown lotus. He whose raiment is of the splendor of lightning. He who is two-\narmed. He who is possessed of the sign of wisdom. He who wears a garland of\nflowers. He who is seated on the center of the golden lotus. Who meditates\nupon him becomes free. His is the _mantra_ of five parts. The first is _Kl \xc4\xabm\nKrishn\xc4\x81ya_. _Kl \xc4\xabm_ is the seed of attraction. The second is _Govind \xc4\x81ya_. The\nthird is _Gop \xc4\xab-jana_. The fourth is _Vallabh \xc4\x81ya_. The fifth and last is _Sw\n\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81_. _Kl \xc4\xabm_\xc2\x97to Krishna\xc2\x97to the Giver of Knowledge\xc2\x97to the Lord of the\nCowherds\xc2\x97 _Sw \xc4\x81h\xc4\x81_!\'\n\n"Om. Adoration to the Universal Form, the Source of all Protection, the Goal\nof Life, the Ruler of the Universe, and the Universe itself.\n\n"Om. Adoration to the Embodiment of Wisdom, the Supreme Delight, Krishna, the\nLord of Cowherds! To the Giver of Knowledge, adoration!"\n\nSuch _mantras_ as this are full of symbology, which helps the intent. The word\n_krishna_ means the color\n\np. 119\n\nof the rain cloud, a symbol of protection and beneficence. The cows are the\nverses of scripture, _Vallabha_ means Lord and also Beloved, and the "cow-herd\npeople" are the great sages. The tree is creation or evolution.\n\nFavorite among the _laya-yog \xc4\xabs_ is the mantra " _Om, aim, kl \xc4\xabm, str\xc4\xabm_." "\n_Om_ " is introductory; the other three are called "seed" _mantras_ ; _aim_\nbeing the seed of speech or intelligence, in the first lotus, _kl \xc4\xabm_ the seed\n_mantra_ of love, in the heart lotus, and _str \xc4\xabm_ the seed _mantra_ of power,\nin the eyebrow lotus. On the _chitrin \xc4\xab_ canal at these points there are\n_granthis_ , or "knots," which obstruct the advance of _kundalin \xc4\xab_. With the\naid of these _mantras_ , they are broken through. Great results are said to\naccrue from many repetitions of this _mantra_ , which must be said neither too\nquickly nor too slowly.\n\nThe _mantra_ _Om_ , which is used at the beginning and end of all prayers,\nneeds special mention. It is considered to have a harmonizing effect, as being\nthe word, or true name, not merely the appellative name, of the "one life\nwithout a second." It is composed of three letters, a, u, and m, and can be\npronounced with the a and u both distinctly heard, or, as is more usual, with\nthe two blended together as O. The meaning may be derived in the following\nway. As a is sounded from the throat, it is the beginning of all sounds, and\nas m is formed by the closing of the lips,\n\np. 120\n\nit is the end, u being in the middle. Therefore when _Om_ is properly sounded\nwith a glide from one letter to the next, it is the complete word. And since\nsound is creative power, _Om_ is not only the natural name of God, but\npronunciation of it is a means to harmony with the divine.\n\nThe same idea is symbolically represented in the _Sh \xc4\x81ndilya Upanishad_, where\nthe yog\xc4\xab is told to meditate, using the _pranava_ that is, _Om_ , at the same\ntime thinking of three goddesses: G\xc4\x81yatr\xc4\xab, a girl of reddish color, seated on\na swan and carrying a mace, who represents the letter a; S\xc4\x81vitr\xc4\xab, a young\nwoman of white color, mounted on an eagle and carrying a disc, who represents\nthe letter u; and Saraswat\xc4\xab, a mature woman of dark color, riding on a bull\nand carrying a trident, who represents the letter m. Those goddesses are the\nwives and _shaktis_ , or powers, of the three members of the Trinity\xc2\x97Shiva,\nVishnu and Brahm\xc4\x81\xc2\x97who together constitute the one Brahman. The yog\xc4\xab is told to\nuse the proportions sixteen, sixty-four and thirty-two for breathing during\nthis meditation.\n\nVery closely allied psychologically with the _mantra-yoga_ is the practice of\nart in connection with religious matters. Just as the repetition of certain\nwords helps the devotee to keep his mind well concentrated, so in the case of\nthe temperament which\n\np. 121\n\nruns to external creativeness, painting and sculpture is a means of holding up\nand preserving the desired emotional and mental states. The whole process is\nlike damming up a valley and so conserving the water for the constant use of\nthe countryside. Art may be looked upon as a form of yoga. Shukr\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81rya says:\n"Let the image-maker establish images in temples by meditation on the deities\nwho are the objects of his devotion. In no other way, not even by direct and\nimmediate vision of an actual object, is it possible to be so absorbed in\ncontemplation as thus in the making of images."\n\nOut of this inevitably comes beauty, even when the intention to do so is not\nintellectually formulated, for action well done always produces that effect in\nsome natural way. Thus, for example, the limbs and figure of the racehorse are\nwonderfully beautiful because of the skill developed in running, and also the\nrunning is beautiful to see. When an artist does his best, the same effect is\nproduced, both in the man and in the work. This itself constitutes a kind of\nunion with the divine, for if it can be said that God is expressible in\nmaterial form, it must be in beauty, since that is the one thing in the\nmaterial world of which the soul never tires.\n\nTo understand all this theoretically one has to remember that in the use of\nthe senses there are three\n\np. 122\n\nfactors\xc2\x97the conscious being, the sensations (as of color, or sound) and the\nsense-organ (including the whole mechanism from the eye or the ear to the\nbrain-center). Occultly, the sensations are something in themselves, which the\nmind carries within itself even away from the body. The objects of the world\nwith their colors etc., are expressions of these sensations in innumerable\ncombinations, brought about through action-organs, and then those objects can\narouse the sensations again through the sense-organs.\n\nThese sensations are vastly important, because they arouse the attentiveness\nof the consciousness, and assist its concentration or attentiveness and so\nenrich its content and power. When consciousness is stronger, clearer, its\npower is greater. Thus sensations are carriers of the will, both ways\xc2\x97from man\nto the world and from the world to man. It is easy from this principle to see\nhow all that is going on in this world is a sort of magic. In that magic we\nget our most formative and delighting effect in what we call beauty, and all\nthings affect us through the shock of beauty or through the lesser process of\nrepetition. Deliberate use of this process is a form of yoga; in the case of\nthe latter method, repetition, we have the mantric effect.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[113:1](gsoy08.htm#fr_73) _Gheranda Sanhit \xc4\x81_ vii 14-15.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter Seven.
