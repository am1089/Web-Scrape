And on account of the (omkara) extending over the whole (Veda), (the view\nthat the term udgitha expresses a specialisation) is appropriate.\n\nIn the passage, 'Let a man meditate on the syllable Om (as) the udgitha,' the\ntwo words 'omkara' and 'udgitha' are placed in co-ordination. 1 The question\nthen arises\n\np. 197\n\nwhether the relation in which the ideas conveyed by these two words stand to\neach other is the relation of super-imposition (adhyasa) or sublation\n(apavada) or unity (ekatva) or specification (vi _s_ esha _n_ a); for prima\nfacie each of these relations may present itself to the mind.--Adhyasa takes\nplace when the idea of one of two things not being dismissed from the mind,\nthe idea of the second thing is superimposed on that of the first thing; so\nthat together with the superimposed idea the former idea remains attached to\nthe thing on which the second idea is superimposed. When e.g. the idea of (the\nentity) Brahman superimposes itself upon the idea of the name, the latter idea\ncontinues in the mind and is not driven out by the former. A similar instance\nis furnished by the superimposition of the idea of the god Vishnu on a statue\nof Vishnu. So, in the case under discussion also, the idea of the udgitha may\nbe superimposed on the omkara or the idea of the omkara on the udgitha.--We,\nin the second place, have apavada when an idea previously attached to some\nobject is recognised as false and driven out by the true idea springing up\nafter the false one. So e.g. when the false idea of the body, the senses, and\nso on being the Self is driven out by the true idea springing up later--and\nexpressed by judgments such as 'Thou art that'--that the idea of the Self is\nto be attached to the Self only. Or, to quote another example, when a previous\nmistaken notion as to the direction of the points of the compass is replaced\nby the true notion. So here also the idea of the udgitha may drive out the\nidea of the omkara or vice versa.--The relation would, in the third place, be\nthat of 'unity' if the terms 'omkara' and 'udgitha' were co-extensive in\nmeaning; just as the terms, 'the Best of the Twice-born,' 'the Brahma _n_ a,'\n'the god among men,' all denote an individual of the noblest caste.--The\nrelation will, finally, be that of specification if, there being a possibility\nof our understanding the omkara in so far as co-extensive with all the Vedas,\nthe term 'udgitha' calls up the idea of the sphere of action of the udgat\n_ri_. The passage would then mean, 'Let a man meditate on that omkara which is\nthe udgitha,' and would\n\np. 198\n\nbe analogous to an injunction such as 'Let him bring that lotus-flower which\nis blue.'\n\nAll these alterations present themselves to the mind, and as there is no\nreason for deciding in favour of any one, the question must remain an\nunsettled one.\n\nTo this purvapaksha-view the Sutra replies, 'And on account of extending over\nthe whole, it is appropriate.'\n\nThe word 'and' stands here in place of 'but,' and is meant to discard the\nthree other alternatives. Three out of the four alternatives are to be set\naside as objectionable; the fourth, against which nothing can be urged, is to\nbe adopted.--The objections lying against the first three alternatives are as\nfollows. In the case of adhyasa we should have to admit that the word which\nexpresses the idea superimposed is not to be taken in its direct sense, but in\nan implied sense 1; and we should moreover have to imagine some fruit for a\nmeditation of that kind. 2 Nor can it be said that we need not imagine such a\nfruit, as scripture itself mentions it in the passage, 'He becomes indeed a\nfulfiller of desires' (I, 1, 7); for this passage indicates the fruit, not of\nthe ideal superimposition of the udgitha on the omkara, but of the meditation\nin which the omkara is viewed as the fulfilment of desires.--Against the\nhypothesis of an apavada there likewise lies the objection that no fruit is to\nbe seen. The cessation of wrong knowledge can certainly not be alleged as\nsuch; for we see no reason why the cessation of the idea that the omkara is\nudgitha and not omkara or vice versa should be beneficial to man. Sublation of\nthe one idea by the other is moreover not even possible in our case; for to\nthe omkara the idea of the omkara remains always attached, and so to the\nudgitha the idea of the udgitha. The passage, moreover, does not aim at\nteaching the true\n\np. 199\n\nnature of something, but at enjoining a meditation of a certain kind.--The\nhypothesis of unity again is precluded by the consideration that as in that\ncase one term would suffice to convey the intended meaning, the employment of\ntwo terms would be purposeless. And moreover the term 'udgitha' is never used\nto denote the omkara in its connexion with the _Ri_ g-veda and Ya _g_ ur-veda;\nnor is the word 'omkara' used to denote that entire second subdivision of a\nsaman which is denoted by the word 'udgitha.' Hence it cannot be said that we\nhave to do with different words only denoting one and the same thing.--There\nthus remains the fourth alternative, 'On account of its comprising all the\nVedas.' That means: In order that the omkara may not be understood here as\nthat one which comprises all the Vedas, it is specified by means of the word\n'udgitha,' in order that that omkara which constitutes a part of the udgitha\nmay be apprehended.--But does not this interpretation also involve the\nadmission of implication, as according to it the word 'udgitha' denotes not\nthe whole udgitha but only a part of it, viz. the omkara?--True, but we have\nto distinguish those cases in which the implied meaning is not far remote from\nthe direct meaning and those in which it is remote. If, in the present case,\nwe embrace the alternative of adhyasa, we have to assume an altogether remote\nimplication, the idea of one matter being superimposed on the idea of an\naltogether different matter. If, on the other hand, we adopt the alternative\nof specification, the implication connected therewith is an easy one, the word\nwhich in its direct sense denotes the whole being understood to denote the\npart. And that words denoting the whole do duty for words denoting the part is\na matter of common occurrence; the words 'cloth,' 'village,' and many others\nare used in this fashion 1.--For all these reasons we declare that the\nappropriate view of the _Kh_ andogya-passage is to take the word 'udgitha' as\nspecialising the term 'omkara 2.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[196:1](sbe38152.htm#fr_132) Samanadhikara _n_ ya, i.e. literally, 'the\nrelation of abiding in a common substratum.'--The two words are shown to stand\nin that relation by their being exhibited in the same case.\n\n[198:1](sbe38152.htm#fr_133) i.e. in the present case we should have to assume\nthat the word udgitha means, by implication, the omkara.--Recourse may be had\nto implied meanings only when the direct meaning is clearly impossible.\n\n[198:2](sbe38152.htm#fr_134) For a special adhyasa-meditation must be attended\nwith a special result.\n\n[199:1](sbe38152.htm#fr_135) We say, e.g. 'the cloth is burned,' even if only\na part of the cloth is burned.\n\n[199:2](sbe38152.htm#fr_136) We therefore, according to, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, have to\nrender the passage p. 200 under discussion as follows, 'Let a man meditate on\nthe syllable Om which is (i.e. which is a part of) the udgitha.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 10](sbe38153.htm)\n\n"
