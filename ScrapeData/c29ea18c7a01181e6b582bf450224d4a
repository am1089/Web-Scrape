INDRA.\n\nAs was noticed previously, Indra, together with Agni and Surya, by means of\nsacrifice obtained supremacy\n\n[![INDRA.](tn/05300.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/05300.jpg)  \nINDRA.  \n\nover the other gods; and if we may judge from the number of hymns addressed to\nhim in the Vedas, he was the most popular deity,\n\np. 54\n\nHe is the god of the firmament, in whose hands are the thunder and the\nlightning; at whose command the refreshing showers fall to render the earth\nfruitful. When it is borne in mind that in India for months together the\nearth, exposed to the scorching rays of the sun, becomes so hard that it is\nimpossible for the fields to be ploughed or the seed to be sown, it will not\nbe regarded as wonderful that the god who is supposed to bestow rain should\nfrequently be appealed to, and that the most laudatory songs should be\naddressed to him. To the poetic, minds of the Vedic age, the clouds that the\nwinds brought from the ocean were enemies who held their treasures in their\nfast embrace until, conquered by Indra, they were forced to pour them upon the\nparched soil. And very naturally when, in answer to the cry of his\nworshippers, the genial rains descended, and the earth was thereby changed\nfrom a desert to a garden, songs of thanksgiving and praise, couched in the\nstrongest terms, were addressed to him. The attributes ascribed to him refer\nprincipally to his physical superiority; and the blessings sought from him are\nchiefly of a physical rather than a spiritual character.\n\nIndra is not regarded as an uncreated deity. In some hymns he is spoken of as\nthe twin-brother of Agni, and therefore the son of Heaven and Earth; whilst,\nin other hymns, heaven and earth are said to have been formed by him. Although\nhis parents are often referred to, it is but seldom that they are named; and\nwhen they are named, they are not always the same. He is the king of the gods;\nand in post-Vedic ages his reign is said to extend for a hundred divine years\nonly; at the end of which time he may be superseded as king by some other of\nthe gods, or even by\n\np. 55\n\nman, if any be able to perform the severe penance necessary to obtain this\nexalted position.\n\nIn pictures, Indra is often represented as a man with four arms and hands;\nwith two he holds a lance, in the third is a thunderbolt, whilst the fourth is\nempty. He is also sometimes painted with two arms only, and, having eyes all\nover his body, is then called Sahasr\xc4\x81ksha (the thousand-eye). He is generally\ndepicted as riding upon the wonderful elephant Airavata, who was produced at\nthe churning of the ocean, * carrying a thunderbolt in his right hand and a\nbow in his left. In the Vedic Age his worship was far more popular than it is\nat present.\n\nThe position and attributes of Indra as taught by the Vedas will be seen from\nthe following description, abbreviated from that given by Dr. Muir:-- \xe2\x80\xa0\n\n"Come, Indra, come, thou much invoked,  \n Our potent hymn thy steeds has yoked.  \n Friend Indra, from the sky descend,  \n Thy course propitious hither bend.  \n But, Indra, though of us thou thinkest,  \n And our libations gladly drinkest,  \n We, mortal men, can only share  \n A humble portion of thy care.  \n We know how many potent ties  \n Enchain thee in thy paradise.  \n Thou hast at home a lovely wife,  \n The charm and solace of thy life.  \n Thou hast a ceaseless round of joys  \n Which all thy circling hours employs;  \n Joys such as gods immortal know,  \n Unguessed by mortals here below."\n\nBeing invoked by mortals, Indra is born. The Sky and the Earth trembled at his\nappearance, and the Sky exclaimed\n\np. 56\n\n"Thy father was a stalwart wight;  \n Of most consummate skill was he,  \n The god whose genius fashioned thee."\n\nImmediately after his birth the god gave unmistakable evidence of his\ndivinity. Grasping his weapons, he cried--\n\n"Where, mother, dwell those warriors fierce,  \n Whose haughty hearts these bolts must pierce?"\n\nBorne in his chariot, hastened by the prayers of his people, the god appears.\n\n"Yet not one form alone he bears,  \n But various shapes of glory wears,  \n His aspect changing at his will,  \n Transmuted, yet resplendent still.  \n In warlike semblance see him stand,  \n Red lightnings wielding in his hand."\n\nReady prepared for him is a feast, the principal attraction of which is the\nSoma juice. * Indra was particularly fond of this intoxicating drink. It is a\nmost strange circumstance that, whilst the Hindus of the present day are\nprohibited from the use of intoxicants, Indra is described as being addicted\nto the Soma; whilst the drink itself is deified and worshipped as a god. Indra\non his arrival is invited to quaff the invigorating cup:--\n\n"Thou, Indra, oft of old hast quaffed  \n With keen delight our Soma draught.  \n All gods the luscious Soma love,  \n But thou all other gods above.  \n Thy mother knew how well this juice  \n Was fitted for her infant\'s use.  \n Into a cup she crushed the sap,  \n Which thou didst sip upon her lap.\n\np. 57\n\n[paragraph continues]  Yes, Indra, on thy natal morn,  \n The very hour that thou wast born,  \n Thou didst those jovial tastes display,  \n Which still survive in strength to-day."\n\nIndra, after singing the praises of the Soma juice, drinks the proffered cup,\nand as a result is most graciously disposed towards the worshippers, ready to\ngive whatever they ask. When thus strengthened by the draught, he goes forth\nto meet the great enemy he came to conquer. This enemy is Vritra (Drought).\nAnd in the conflict and victory are seen the peculiar blessings to the earth\nand man that Indra is able to grant. Vritra is thus described:--\n\n                 "He whose magic powers  \n From earth withhold the genial showers;  \n Of mortal men the foe malign,  \n And rival of the race divine;  \n Whose demon hosts from age to age  \n With Indra war unceasing wage;  \n Who, times unnumbered crushed and slain,  \n Is ever newly born again,  \n And evermore renews the strife  \n In which again he forfeits life."\n\nThe battle is described at length; in which we have a graphic description of\nthe commencement of the rainy season, with the severe thunderstorms which\nusually accompany this change of the seasons. At last the conflict is over:\n\n"And soon the knell of Vritra\'s doom  \n Was sounded by the clang and boom  \n   Of Indra\'s iron shower.  \n Pierced, cloven, crushed, with horrid yell,  \n The dying demon headlong fell  \n   Down from his cloud-built tower."\n\nAs a result of the victory of the god, the rains descend and the earth is made\nfruitful:\n\np. 58\n\n"Now bound by Sushna\'s spell no more,  \n The clouds discharge their liquid store;  \n And long by torrid sunbeams baked  \n The plains by copious showers are slaked;  \n The rivers swell, and seawards sweep  \n Their turbid torrents broad and deep.  \n The peasant views with deep delight,  \n And thankful heart, the auspicious sight.  \n His leafless fields, so sere and sad,  \n Will soon with waving crops be glad;  \n And mother Earth, now brown and bare,  \n A robe of brilliant green will wear."\n\nAfter this blessing has been received, the sun shines, and earth again is\nbright; the gods come with their congratulations to their king, and men\npresent their thanksgivings.\n\nSuch was Indra in ancient times; and though worshipped still, he occupies a\nvery inferior position in the present age. As mentioned previously, according\nto the teaching of the later books, his rule over the gods continues for a\nhundred divine * years; at the expiration of which time he may be superseded\nby another god, or even by a man. The Pur\xc4\x81nas teach that, in each age of the\nworld, a different being has enjoyed this position. In the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0\nis the following story of a man raising himself to the throne of Indra.\n\nThere was a war between the gods and demons; both parties inquired of Brahm\xc4\x81,\nwhich would be victorious. Brahm\xc4\x81 replied, "The side for which R\xc4\x81ji (an\nearthly king) shall take up arms." The demons called first upon R\xc4\x81ji to invoke\nhis aid. He promised to assist them provided they would make him their Indra\nor king. They could not promise this, as Prahl\xc4\x81da their Indra\'s term of office\nwas not yet expired. The same\n\np. 59\n\ncondition being proposed to the gods, they consented, and R\xc4\x81ji became their\nIndra. He fought for them, and conquered. Upon this, Indra bowed down before\nhim, and, placing R\xc4\x81ji\'s foot upon his head, said, "Thou hast preserved me\nfrom a great danger. I acknowledge thee as my father: thou art king over all;\nI am thy son." R\xc4\x81ji, however, was contented to remain as king on earth, and\nappointed Indra to continue as his representative on the throne of heaven. On\nthe death of R\xc4\x81ji, his sons wished to assume the position their father had\ndeclined. This Indra opposed, but was at length compelled to yield. After a\ntime, being sad because deprived of his share in the sacrifices of mortals,\nIndra met with his spiritual preceptor Vrihaspati, and asked him for a morsel\nof the sacrificial butter. The teacher replied that, had Indra applied to him\nearlier, he would not have been reduced to such straits; but "as it is," he\nsaid, "I will regain your sovereignty in a few days." Upon this he commenced a\nsacrifice, with the special purpose of obtaining power for Indra. The result\nwas, that R\xc4\x81ji\'s sons were led into sin, they became enemies of the Br\xc4\x81hmans,\ndespised the Vedas, and neglected their religious duties. When thus weakened,\nIndia fell upon and slew them.\n\nThe most effectual way by which a mortal could obtain the position of Indra\nwas by the sacrifice of a hundred horses; and, as will be seen in the account\nof Gang\xc4\x81, * the Indra of that time did not object to play the part of a thief,\nso as to prevent the completion of the rites by which he was to be deprived of\nhis sovereignty. The most common and generally successful method by which\nthese ambitious mortals were frustrated in their design was by his sending\ndown\n\np. 60\n\nsome celestial nymphs; called Apsaras, who, by their beauty, distracted the\nthoughts of the devotees, and rendered them unfit to offer this great\nsacrifice.\n\nIn the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," * there is a legend of a conflict between Indra and\nKrishna, in which Indra is overcome. Krishna, accompanied by his wife\nSatyabh\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81, visits Indra in his heaven. On her arrival, this lady was most\nanxious to obtain possession of the wonderful P\xc4\x81rij\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81 tree, which was\nproduced at the churning of the ocean, and planted in Indra\'s heavenly garden.\nThis tree was beautiful in form, was adorned with lovely and sweet-scented\nflowers, and bore most luscious fruit. The flowers had this virtue, that, worn\nin the hair by a wife, they enabled her to retain the love of her husband;\nwhilst those who ate the fruit of this tree could remember what had occurred\nin their previous states of existence. At the request of his wife, Krishna\ntook the tree, and placed it upon Garuda, his wonderful bird-vehicle.\nImmediately there was an uproar in heaven; but though Indra and his attendant\ndeities tried to prevent the removal of his property, they could not do so.\nKrishna caught a thunderbolt of Indra in his hand, and, returning home unhurt,\nplanted the tree in his garden.\n\nThe R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana has a story showing that Indra was believed to have been guilty\nof the grossest immorality--the seduction of the wife of his spiritual\nteacher. He is said to have visited the house of Gautama, in the form of a\nsage, hoping to be mistaken by the preceptor\'s wife for her husband, who was\nabsent from home. But although Ahaly\xc4\x81 knew him to be Indra, she yielded to his\nwishes. As Indra was about to leave, Gautama returned, and, knowing what had\nhappened, cursed the\n\np. 61\n\ngod and his wife. Indra in consequence lost his man- hood; and Ahaly\xc4\x81 was\ndoomed to live for many years\n\ninvisible in a forest, until R\xc4\x81ma should come to restore her to her former\nstate. * Another account of this curse of Gautama was that Indra was compelled\nto carry a thousand disgraceful marks upon his body, that all might know the\nsin of which he had been guilty. At the god\'s earnest request these were\nchanged from their original form into eyes; which by the ignorant came to be\nregarded as an indication of his omniscience.\n\nThe heaven of Indra must not be passed over without notice, as it is there the\ngood on earth hope to go for a time, as a reward of their holy lives. To go to\nSwarga, as his heaven is named, is not the highest happiness a man can obtain,\nbecause he cannot remain there for ever. When his allotted years of happiness\nare over, he must return to earth and live other lives, until he becomes\nperfect and fit to enjoy the highest felicity--absorption into the Divine\nBeing. The "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0 says: "Not in hell alone do the souls of the\ndeceased undergo pain: there is no cessation even in heaven; for its temporary\ninhabitant is ever tormented with the prospect of descending again to earth.\nAgain must he be born upon earth, and again must he die. Whatever is produced\nthat is most acceptable to man becomes a seed whence springs the tree of\nsorrow."\n\nThe home of Indra is situated on Mount Meru. \xe2\x80\xa1 It\n\np. 62\n\nhas beautiful houses for its inhabitants; and the splendour of its capital is\nunequalled in the universe. Its gardens are stocked with trees that afford a\ngrateful shade, yield the most luscious fruits, and are adorned with beautiful\nand fragrant flowers. Most beautiful nymphs (Apsaras) charm the happy\ninhabitants, whilst choristers and musicians, unrivalled in the universe,\ndiscourse sweet music. The city was built by Visvakarma. It is eight hundred\nmiles in circumference, and forty miles high. Its pillars are diamonds; its\npalaces, thrones, and furniture, pure gold. *\n\nIn Bengal this deity is worshipped one day in each year. His image is made of\nmud, prettily painted; on the day after it has been worshipped it is cast into\nthe river. At the commencement of a sacrifice, too, he is invoked, in the hope\nthat he will convey the prayers and offerings to the deity specially\nworshipped at that time, or that he will conduct the deity into the presence\nof the worshippers. In seasons of drought special offerings are made to him in\nsome parts of the country, that through his power the clouds may pour their\nstreams upon the parched country.\n\nThe more common of Indra\'s other names are the following:--Sakra, the able\none; Divapati, the lord of the gods; Bajr\xc4\xab, he who wields the thunderbolt;\nVritrah\xc4\x81, the destroyer of Vritra; Meghav\xc4\x81hana, he who rides on the clouds;\nMahendra, the great Indra; Swargapati, the lord of heaven.\n\np. 63\n\n##### 2\\. INDR\xc4\x80NI.\n\nOf Indr\xc4\x81ni, the wife of Indra (called also Sachi), very little is said. In the\nRig-Veda * we read, "Among all females Indr\xc4\x81ni is the most fortunate; for her\nhusband shall not at any future time die of old age." This may be explained by\nthe fact that Indr\xc4\x81ni is wife to all who successively attain to the throne of\nIndra. There is always some one ruling in heaven; the office is perpetual, and\nas she is the wife of the reigning king, whoever he may be, her husband can\nnever die of old age. Though kings may come and go, she continues queen. She\nis said to have a son, Chitragupta by name, who was born of a cow; for, owing\nto a curse pronounced by Um\xc4\x81, none of the goddesses could become a mother. She\npractised austerities, in order that she might not be childless; and by means\nof this expedient her desire was gratified. At the birth of this child, the\nreputed mother suffered all the pains attendant on childbirth, and was able to\nnurse him.\n\n##### 3\\. PARJANYA.\n\nThere are a few hymns addressed to this deity in the Rig-Veda; but from the\ncharacter and functions ascribed to him it is difficult to see wherein he\ndiffers from Indra. Professor Roth \xe2\x80\xa0 says, "Taking a review of the whole, we\nfind that Parjanya is a god who presides over the lightning, the thunder, the\nrain, and the procreation of plants and living creatures. But it is by no\nmeans clear whether he is originally a god of the rain, or a god of the\nthunder." In another essay he says Parjanya is "the god of the thunderstorms\nand rain, the generator\n\np. 64\n\nand nourisher of plants and living creatures. Seeing that the hymns addressed\nto this deity are so very similar to those sung to Indra, may not Parjanya\n(whose name signifies one acting for another) be merely another name for\nIndra? " In these hymns are the following passages, * all of which are in\nperfect harmony with those in honour of Indra:--"Laud Parjanya, worship him\nwith reverence--the procreative and stimulating fructifier. . . . He splits\nthe trees; he destroys the Rakshasas (cloud demons who withhold the rains).\nThe whole creation is afraid of his mighty stroke; even the innocent man flees\nbefore the vigorous god, when Parjanya thundering smites the evildoers. Like a\ncharioteer urging forward his horses with a whip, the god brings into view his\nshowery scouts. From afar, the lions\' roarings arise when Parjanya charges the\nclouds with rain. The winds blow, the lightnings fall, the plants shoot up,\nthe heaven fructifies; food is produced for all created things when Parjanya\nthundering replenishes the earth with moisture. Raise aloft thy vast water-\nvessel, and pour down showers; let the discharged rivulets roll on forward,\nmoisten the heaven and earth with fatness; let there be well-filled drinking-\nplaces for the cows."\n\nIn all this there is not a single idea that was not expressed in the hymns to\nIndra noticed previously. In the Pur\xc4\x81nas Indra is generally styled the king of\nthe gods; whilst Parjanya is spoken of as the ruler over, and as dwelling in,\nthe clouds.\n\n##### 4\\. V\xc4\x80YU. __\n\nAnother of the storm-gods is V\xc4\x81yu, the god of the winds. He is often\nassociated with Indra, and is\n\np. 65\n\nregarded, equally with him, as representing or ruling over the atmosphere. He\nwon the race for the first draught of the Soma juice; and, at Indra\'s request,\nallowed him to have a quarter of it. He does not occupy a very prominent\nposition in the Vedic hymns. In one passage * we read, "The two worlds (heaven\nand earth) generated him for wealth." This may be intended to teach his\nparentage; and Dr. Muir says that he is not aware of any other passage where\nhis\n\n[![V\xc4\x80YU.](tn/06500.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/06500.jpg)  \nV\xc4\x80YU.  \n\nparentage is declared. He is said to be the son-in-law of Tvastri\n(Visvakarma); but here a difficulty occurs: only one daughter of Tvastri is\nmentioned, and, as was noticed in the account of Surya, he was said to be\nhusband of this girl.\n\nV\xc4\x81yu is described \xe2\x80\xa0 as being most handsome in form; one who moves noisily in a\nshining car, drawn by a pair of red or purple horses. At times the number of\nhorses is increased to ninety-nine, a hundred, or even a thousand.\n\np. 66\n\n[paragraph continues] This latter number would probably be employed during a\ncyclone. He is seldom mentioned in connection with the Maruts (storm-deities),\nthough in one place he is said to have begotten them by the rivers of heaven.\n\nAnother name for V\xc4\x81yu in the Vedas is V\xc4\x81ta. The praise of V\xc4\x81ta is sung in the\nfollowing hymn:-- * (I celebrate) the glory of V\xc4\x81ta\'s chariot; his noise comes\nrending and resounding. Touching the sky, he moves onward, making all things\nruddy; and he comes propelling the dust of the earth. The gusts of air rush\nafter him, and congregate upon him as women in an assembly. Sitting along with\nthem on the same car, the god [Indra] who is king of this universe is borne\nalong. Hasting forward . . . he never rests. Friend of the waters, first-born,\nholy, in what place was he born His sounds have been heard, but his form is\nnot (seen)."\n\nIn a later age, when it was thought necessary to connect the heroes, whose\nexploits are then sung, with the gods, V\xc4\x81yu, or Pavan as he is then called, is\nsaid to have had a son, Hanum\xc4\x81n, by a monkey mother. Hanum\xc4\x81n played a most\nconspicuous part in R\xc4\x81ma\'s expedition in search of Sita. In the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata,\nBh\xc4\xabma (the Strong), one of the bravest of the warriors whose history is given\nthere, is also said to be a son of V\xc4\x81yu. Kunti, the mother of Bh\xc4\xabma, had a\nboon granted as a reward of her devotion, that she could obtain a child by any\nof the gods she might wish. As her husband, owing to a curse, could not become\na father, she employed this charm, and so V\xc4\x81yu became the father of Bh\xc4\xabma.\n\nV\xc4\x81yu or Pavan (the Purifier) is represented in pictures as a white man riding\non a deer, and carries a white flag in his hand. In the Pur\xc4\x81nas he is said to\nbe son of Aditi.\n\nOther names by which this deity is known are the\n\np. 67\n\nfollowing:--Anila, breath; M\xc4\x81rut, air that is necessary to life; Sparsana, he\nwho touches; Gandhavaha, he who carries odours.\n\n##### 5\\. THE MARUTS.\n\nIn one passage in the Rig-Veda these gods are said to be one hundred and\neighty in number; in another text, twenty-seven is the number given; whilst in\nthe Pur\xc4\x81nas they are said to be forty-nine. In the Vedas they are called the\nsons of Rudra. They are the companions of Indra; at times they worship him,\nand thus acknowledge his superiority; at others they seem to assert their\ninherent power, and remind Indra of the aid they have given him. They are\naddressed in the following strain:-- * "Spears rest upon your shoulders, ye\nMaruts; ye have anklets on your feet, golden ornaments on your breasts, lustre\nin your ears, fiery lightnings in your hands, and golden helmets placed on\nyour heads." They are armed with golden weapons and lightnings; they dart\nthunderbolts, gleam like flames of fire, and are borne along with the fury of\nboisterous winds. They split Vritra (Drought) to pieces, are clothed with\nrain, create darkness during the day, water the earth, and avert heat. They\ncause the earth and the mountains to quake. They were accustomed to the use of\nthe soma; and were appealed to, to bring healing remedies, which are described\nas abiding in the (river) Sindhu, the seas, and the hills.\n\nIn the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0 we find quite a different account of the Maruts. They\nare there said to be the sons of Kasyapa and Diti. Diti having lost her\nchildren, propitiated her husband, who promised her a boon. She\n\np. 68\n\nasked that she might have a son of irresistible prowess and valour, who should\ndestroy Indra. The Muni promised to grant this request on one condition. "You\nshall bear a son," he said, "who shall slay Indra, if with thoughts wholly\npious, and person entirely pure, you carefully carry the babe in your womb for\na hundred years." Diti accepted the boon with this condition. Indra hearing of\nthis, tried his best to distract her mind, and so prevent the birth of this\nwonderful child. When ninety-nine years had passed, an opportunity offered\nitself. Diti retired to rest one night without having washed her feet, and\nthus violated a rule of ceremonial purity. Indra, ever-watchful, availing\nhimself of this neglect, was able to accomplish his purpose. With his\nthunderbolt he cut the embryo into seven parts. The children cried bitterly,\nand Indra was unable to console them. Incensed at their obstinacy in crying,\nhe cut each of these seven parts into seven, and thus formed the forty-nine\nMaruts. The name Maruts was given to them from the words "Ma rodih " (Weep\nnot), used by Indra when trying to quiet them; and they became subordinate\ndeities--the associates of the wielder of the thunderbolt.\n\nIt is not difficult to see how the dwellers in India should have imagined that\none god, even though he was the king of the gods, should sometimes need\nassistance in the management of the winds. The farther the Aryan immigrants\ntravelled south and eastward, the fiercer were the storms they experienced.\nHence arose the hymns addressed to the lesser deities who were invoked to\nassist Indra in his mighty task of controlling them.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[55:*](hmvp11.htm#fr_50) See part ii. chap. iv.\n\n[55:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp11.htm#fr_51) Muir, O.
