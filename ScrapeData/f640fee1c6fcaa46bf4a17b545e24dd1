That (Brahman) is unevolved; for (thus scripture) says.\n\nIf that highest Brahman which is different from the world that is negatived in\nthe passage discussed above really exists, why then is it not apprehended?--\nBecause, the Sutrakara replies, it is unevolved, not to be apprehended by the\nsenses; for it is the witness of whatever is apprehended (i.e. the subject in\nall apprehension). Thus _S_ ruti says, 'He is not apprehended by the eye, nor\nby speech, nor by the other senses, not by penance or good works' (Mu. Up.\nIII, 1, 8); 'That Self is to be described by No, no! He is incomprehensible,\nfor he cannot be comprehended' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 26); 'That which cannot be\nseen nor apprehended' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 6); 'When in that which is invisible,\nincorporeal, undefined, unsupported' &c. (Taitt. Up. II, 7). Similar\nstatements are made in Sm _ri_ ti-passages; so e.g. 'He is called unevolved,\nnot to be fathomed by thought, unchangeable.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 24](sbe38127.htm)\n\n"
