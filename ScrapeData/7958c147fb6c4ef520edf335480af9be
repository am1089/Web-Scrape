If the Sa _m_ hitas are presupposed by the Brahma\n_n_ as, at least in that form in which we possess them, then this Upanishad,\nbeing the only one that forms part of a Sa _m_ hita, might claim a very early\nage. The Sa _m_ hita of the White Ya _g_ ur-veda, however, is acknowledged to\nbe of modern origin, as compared with the Sa _m_ hita of the Black Ya _g_ ur-\nveda, and it would not be safe therefore to ascribe to this Upanishad a much\nhigher antiquity than to those which have found a place in the older Brahma\n_n_ as and \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas.\n\nThere are differences between the text, as contained in the Ya _g_ ur-veda-sa\n_m_ hita, and the text of the Upanishad by itself. Those which are of some\ninterest have been mentioned in the notes.\n\nIn some notes appended to the translation of this Upanishad I have called\nattention to what seems to me\n\np. ci\n\nits peculiar character, namely, the recognition of the necessity of works as a\npreparation for the reception of the highest knowledge. This agrees well with\nthe position occupied by this Upanishad at the end of the Sa _m_ hita, in\nwhich the sacrificial works and the hymns that are to accompany them are\ncontained. The doctrine that the moment a man is enlightened, he becomes free,\nas taught in other Upanishads, led to a rejection of all discipline and a\ncondemnation of all sacrifices, which could hardly have been tolerated in the\nlast chapter of the Ya _g_ ur-veda-sa _m_ hita, the liturgical Veda par\nexcellence.\n\nOther peculiarities of this Upanishad are the name \xc3\x8e _s_ , lord, a far more\npersonal name for the highest Being than Brahman; the asurya (demoniacal) or\nasurya (sunless) worlds to which all go who have lost their self; Matari _s_\nvan, used in the sense of pra _n_ a or spirit; asnaviram, without muscles, in\nthe sense of incorporeal; and the distinction between sambhuti and asambhuti\nin verses 12-14.\n\nThe editions of the text, commentaries, and glosses, and the earlier\ntranslations may be seen in the works quoted before, p. lxxxiv.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1](sbe01022.htm)\n\n'
