Dadhimukh escapes from the infuriated monkeys and hastens to\nSugriva to report their misconduct. Sugriva infers that Hanuman and his band\nhave been successful in their search, and that the exuberance of spirits and\nthe mischief complained of, are but the natural expression of their joy.\nDadhimukh obtains little sympathy from Sugriva, and is told to return and send\nthe monkeys on with all possible speed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXVI.: Rama's Speech.](ry398.htm)\n\n"
