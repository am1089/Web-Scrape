V\xc3\x82 _G_ A _S_ RAVASA 1, desirous (of heavenly rewards), surrendered (at a\nsacrifice) all that he possessed. He had a son of the name of Na _k_ iketas.\n\n2\\. When the (promised) presents were being given (to the priests), faith\nentered into the heart of Na _k_ iketas, who was still a boy, and he thought:\n\n3\\. 'Unblessed 2, surely, are the worlds to which a man goes by giving (as his\npromised present at a sacrifice) cows which have drunk water, eaten hay, given\ntheir milk 3, and are barren.'\n\n4\\. He (knowing that his father had promised to give up all that he possessed,\nand therefore his son also) said to his father: 'Dear father, to whom wilt\nthou give me?'\n\np. 2\n\nHe said it a second and a third time. Then the father replied (angrily):\n\n'I shall give thee 1 unto Death.'\n\n(The father, having once said so, though in haste, had to be true to his word\nand to sacrifice his son.)\n\n5\\. The son said: 'I go as the first, at the head of many (who have still to\ndie); I go in the midst of many (who are now dying). What will be the work of\nYama (the ruler of the departed) which to-day he has to do unto me 2?\n\np. 3\n\n6\\. 'Look back how it was with those who came before, look forward how it will\nbe with those who come hereafter. A mortal ripens like corn, like corn he\nsprings up again 1.'\n\n\n\n(Na _k_ iketas enters into the abode of Yama Vaivasvata, and there is no one\nto receive him. Thereupon one of the attendants of Yama is supposed to say:)\n\n7\\. 'Fire enters into the houses, when a Brahma _n_ a enters as a guest 2.\nThat fire is quenched by this peace-offering;--bring water, O Vaivasvata 3!\n\n8\\. 'A Brahma _n_ a that dwells in the house of a foolish man without\nreceiving food to eat, destroys his hopes and expectations, his possessions,\nhis righteousness, his sacred and his good deeds, and all his sons and cattle\n4.'\n\n(Yama, returning to his house after an absence of three nights, during which\ntime Na _k_ iketas had received no hospitality from him, says:)\n\n9\\. 'O Brahma _n_ a, as thou, a venerable guest, hast dwelt in my house three\nnights without eating,\n\np. 4\n\ntherefore choose now three boons. Hail to thee! and welfare to me!'\n\n10\\. Na _k_ iketas said: 'O Death, as the first of the three boons I choose\nthat Gautama, my father, be pacified, kind, and free from anger towards me;\nand that he may know me and greet me, when I shall have been dismissed by\nthee.'\n\n11\\. Yama said: 'Through my favour Auddalaki \xc3\x82ru _n_ i, thy father, will know\nthee, and be again towards thee as he was before. He shall sleep peacefully\nthrough the night, and free from anger, after having seen thee freed from the\nmouth of death.'\n\n12\\. Na _k_ iketas said: 'In the heaven-world there is no fear; thou art not\nthere, O Death, and no one is afraid on account of old age. Leaving behind\nboth hunger and thirst, and out of the reach of sorrow, all rejoice in the\nworld of heaven.'\n\n13\\. 'Thou knowest, O Death, the fire-sacrifice which leads us to heaven; tell\nit to me, for I am full of faith. Those who live in the heaven-world reach\nimmortality,--this I ask as my second boon.'\n\n14\\. Yama said: 'I tell it thee, learn it from me, and when thou understandest\nthat fire-sacrifice which leads to heaven, know, O Na _k_ iketas, that it is\nthe attainment of the endless worlds, and their firm support, hidden in\ndarkness 1.'\n\n15\\. Yama then told him that fire-sacrifice, the beginning of all the worlds\n2, and what bricks are\n\np. 5\n\nrequired for the altar, and how many, and how they are to be placed. And Na\n_k_ iketas repeated all as it had been told to him. Then M _ri_ tyu, being\npleased with him, said again:\n\n16\\. The generous 1, being satisfied, said to him:\n\nI give thee now another boon; that fire-sacrifice shall be named after thee,\ntake also this many-coloured chain 2.'\n\n17\\. 'He who has three times performed this Na _k_ iketa rite, and has been\nunited with the three (father, mother, and teacher), and has performed the\nthree duties (study, sacrifice, almsgiving) overcomes birth and death. When he\nhas learnt and understood this fire, which knows (or makes us know) all that\nis born of Brahman 3, which is venerable and divine, then he obtains\neverlasting peace.'\n\n18\\. 'He who knows the three Na _k_ iketa fires, and knowing the three, piles\nup the Na _k_ iketa sacrifice, he, having first thrown off the chains of\ndeath, rejoices in the world of heaven, beyond the reach of grief.'\n\n19\\. 'This, O Na _k_ iketas, is thy fire which leads to heaven, and which thou\nhast chosen as thy second boon. That fire all men will proclaim 4. Choose now,\nO Na _k_ iketas, thy third boon.'\n\n20\\. Na _k_ iketas said: 'There is that doubt, when a man is dead,--some\nsaying, he is; others, he is not. This I should like to know, taught by thee;\nthis is the third of my boons.'\n\n21\\. Death said: 'On this point even the gods\n\np. 6\n\nhave doubted formerly; it is not easy to understand. That subject is subtle.\nChoose another boon, O Na _k_ iketas, do not press me, and let me off that\nboon.'\n\n22\\. Na _k_ iketas said: 'On this point even the gods have doubted indeed, and\nthou, Death, hast declared it to be not easy to understand, and another\nteacher like thee is not to be found:--surely no other boon is like unto\nthis.'\n\n23\\. Death said: 'Choose sons and grandsons who shall live a hundred years,\nherds of cattle, elephants, gold, and horses. Choose the wide abode of the\nearth, and live thyself as many harvests as thou desirest.'\n\n24\\. 'If you can think of any boon equal to that, choose wealth, and long\nlife. Be (king), Na _k_ iketas, on the wide earth 1. I make thee the enjoyer\nof all desires.'\n\n25\\. 'Whatever desires are difficult to attain among mortals, ask for them\naccording to thy wish;--these fair maidens with their chariots and musical\ninstruments,--such are indeed not to be obtained by men,--be waited on by them\nwhom I give to thee, but do not ask me about dying.'\n\n26\\. Na _k_ iketas said: 'These things last till tomorrow, O Death, for they\nwear out this vigour of all the senses. Even the whole of life is short. Keep\nthou thy horses, keep dance and song for thyself.'\n\n27\\. 'No man can be made happy by wealth. Shall we possess wealth, when we see\nthee? Shall we live,\n\np. 7\n\nas long as thou rulest? Only that boon (which I have chosen) is to be chosen\nby me.'\n\n28\\. 'What mortal, slowly decaying here below, and knowing, after having\napproached them, the freedom from decay enjoyed by the immortals, would\ndelight in a long life, after he has pondered on the pleasures which arise\nfrom beauty and love 1?'\n\n29\\. 'No, that on which there is this doubt, O Death, tell us what there is in\nthat great Hereafter. Na _k_ iketas does not choose another boon but that\nwhich enters into the hidden world.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](sbe15010.htm#fr_78) Va _g_ a _s_ ravasa is called \xc3\x82ru _n_ i Auddalaki\nGautama, the father of Na _k_ iketas. The father of _S_ vetaketu, another\nenlightened pupil (see _Kh_ and. Up. VI, 1, 1), is also called \xc3\x82ru _n_ i\n(Uddalaka, comm. Kaush. Up. I, x) Gautama. _S_ vetaketu himself is called \xc3\x82ru\n_n_ eya, i.e. the son of \xc3\x82ru _n_ i, the grandson of \xc3\x82ru _n_ a, and likewise\nAuddalaki. Auddalaki is a son of Uddalaka, but _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara (Ka _th_. Up. I, 11)\ntakes Auddalaki as possibly the same as Uddalaka. See B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. Up. III,\n6, 1.\n\n[1:2](sbe15010.htm#fr_79) As to @ananda@, unblessed, see B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. Up. IV,\n4, 11; Va _g_ as. Sa _m_ h. Up. 3 (Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. 310.\n\n[1:3](sbe15010.htm#fr_80) \xc3\x82nandagiri explains that the cows meant here are\ncows no longer able to drink, to eat, to give milk, and to calve.\n\n[2:1](sbe15010.htm#fr_81) Dadami, I give, with the meaning of the future. Some\nMSS. write dasyami.\n\n[2:2](sbe15010.htm#fr_82) I translate these verses freely, i.e. independently\nof the commentator, not that I ever despise the traditional interpretation\nwhich the commentators have preserved to us, but because I think that, after\nhaving examined it, we have a right to judge for ourselves. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara says\nthat the son, having been addressed by his father full of anger, was sad, and\nsaid to himself: 'Among many pupils I am the first, among many middling pupils\nI am the middlemost, but nowhere am I the last. Yet though I am such a good\npupil, my father has said that he will consign me unto death. What duty has he\nto fulfil toward Yama which he means to fulfil to-day by giving me to him?\nThere may be no duty, he may only have spoken in haste. Yet a father's word\nmust not be broken.' Having considered this, the son comforted his father, and\nexhorted him to behave like his forefathers, and to keep his word. I do not\nthink this view of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's could have been the view of the old poet. He\nmight have made the son say that he was the best or one of the best of his\nfather's pupils, but hardly that he was also one of his middling pupils, thus\nimplying that he never was among the worst. That would be out of keeping with\nthe character of Na _k_ iketas, as drawn by the poet himself. Na _k_ iketas is\nfull of faith and wishes to die, he would be the last to think of excuses why\nhe should not die. The second half of the verse may be more doubtful. It may\nmean what _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara thinks it means, only that we should get thus again an\nimplied complaint of Na _k_ iketas against his father, and this is not in\nkeeping with his character. The mind of Na _k_ iketas is bent on what is to\ncome, on what he will see after death, and on what Yama will do unto him.\n'What has Yama to do,' he asks, 'what can he do, what is it that he will to-\nday do unto p. 3 me?' This seems to me consistent with the tenor of the\nancient story, while _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's interpretations and interpolations savour\ntoo much of the middle ages of India.\n\n[3:1](sbe15010.htm#fr_83) Sasya, corn rather than grass; \xce\xb5\xe1\xbc\xb4\xce\xb1, \xe1\xbc\xa4\xce\xb9\xce\xbf\xce\xbd Benfey;\nWelsh haidd, according to Rhys; different from _s_ ash-pa, ces-pes, Benfey.\n\n[3:2](sbe15010.htm#fr_84) Cf. Vasish _th_ a XI, 13; Sacred Books of the East,\nvol. xiv, p. 51.\n\n[3:3](sbe15010.htm#fr_85) Vaivasvata, a name of Yama, the ruler of the\ndeparted. Water is the first gift to be offered to a stranger who claims\nhospitality.\n\n[3:4](sbe15010.htm#fr_86) Here again some words are translated differently\nfrom _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara. He explains a _s_ a as asking for a wished-for object,\npratiksha as looking forward with a view to obtaining an unknown object.\nSa\xe1\xb9\x85gata he takes as reward for intercourse with good people; sun _ri_ ta, as\nusual, as good and kind speech; ish _t_ a as rewards for sacrifices; purta as\nrewards for public benefits.\n\n[4:1](sbe15010.htm#fr_87) The commentator translates: 'I tell it thee, attend\nto me who knows the heavenly fire.' Here the nom. sing. of the participle\nwould be very irregular, as we can hardly refer it to bravimi. Then, 'Know\nthis fire as a means of obtaining the heavenly world, know that fire as the\nrest or support of the world, when it assumes the form of Vira _g_ , and as\nhidden in the heart of men.'\n\n[4:2](sbe15010.htm#fr_88) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara: the first embodied, in the shape of Vira\n_g_.\n\n[5:1](sbe15010.htm#fr_89) Verses 16-18 seem a later addition.\n\n[5:2](sbe15010.htm#fr_90) This arises probably from a misunderstanding of\nverse 11, 3.\n\n[5:3](sbe15010.htm#fr_91) _G_ atavedas.\n\n[5:4](sbe15010.htm#fr_92) Tavaiva is a later addition, caused by the\ninterpolation of verses 15-18.\n\n[6:1](sbe15010.htm#fr_93) Mahabhumau, on the great earth, has been explained\nalso by maha bhumau, be great on the earth. It is doubtful, however, whether\nmahi for mahin could be admitted in the Upanishads, and whether it would not\nbe easier to write mahan bhumau.\n\n[7:1](sbe15010.htm#fr_94) A very obscure verse. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara gives a various\nreading kva tadastha _h_ for kvadha _h_ stha _h_ , in the sense of I given to\nthese pleasures,' which looks like an emendation. I have changed a _g_ iryatam\ninto a _g_ aryatam, and take it for an acc. sing., instead of a gen. plur.,\nwhich could hardly be governed by upetya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2](sbe15011.htm)\n\n"
