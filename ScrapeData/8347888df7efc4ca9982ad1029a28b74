Griffith, [1899], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 304\n\n### BOOK THE FORTIETH.\n\nENVELOPED by the Lord must be This All\xc2\x97each thing that  \nmoves on earth.  \nWith that renounced enjoy thyself. Covet no wealth of  \nany man.  \n2 One, only doing Karma here, should wish to live a hundred  \nyears.  \nNo way is there for thee but this. So Karma cleaveth not  \nto man.  \n3 Aye, to the Asuras belong those worlds enwrapt in blinding  \ngloom.  \nTo them, when life on earth is done, depart the men who  \nkill the Self.\n\np. 305\n\n4 Motionless, one, swifter than Mind\xc2\x97the Devas failed to  \no\xc2\x92ertake it speeding on before them.  \nIt, standing still, outstrips the others running. Herein Both  \nMatarisvan stablish Action.  \n5 It moveth; it is motionless. It is far distant; it is near.  \nIt is within This All; and it surrounds This All externally.  \n6 The man who in his Self beholds all creatures and all things  \nthat be,  \nAnd in all beings sees his Self, thence doubts no longer,  \nponders not.  \n7 When, in the man who clearly knows, Self hath become all  \nthings that are,\n\np. 306\n\nWhat wilderment, what grief is there in him who sees the  \nOne alone?  \n8 He hath attained unto the Bright, Bodiless, Woundless,  \nSinewless, the Pure which evil hath not pierced.  \nFar-sighted, wise, encompassing, he self-existent hath  \nprescribed aims, as propriety demands, unto the  \neverlasting Years.  \n9 Deep into shade of blinding gloom fall Asambhuti's  \nworshippers.  \nThey sink to darkness deeper yet who on Sambhuti are  \nintent.  \n10 One fruit, they say, from Sambhava, another from Asambhava.  \nThus from the sages have we heard who have declared this  \nlore to us.  \n11 The man who knows Sambhuti and Vinasa simultaneously,  \nHe, by Vinasa passing death, gains by Sambhuti endless life.\n\np. 307\n\n12 To blinding darkness go the men who make a cult of  \nNescience.  \nThe devotees of Science enter darkness that is darker still.  \n13 Different is the fruit, they say, of Science and of Nescience.  \nThus from the sages have we heard who have declared this  \nlore to us.  \n14 The man who knoweth well these two, Science and Nescience,  \ncombined,  \nO\xc2\x92ercoming death by Nescience by Science gaineth endless  \nlife.  \n15 My breath reach everlasting Air! In ashes let my body end.  \nOM! Mind, remember thou; remember thou my sphere;  \nremember thou my deeds.\n\np. 308\n\n16 By goodly path lead us to riches, Agni, thou God who  \nknowest all our works and wisdom.  \nRemove the sin that makes us stray and wander: most  \nample adoration will we bring thee.  \n17 The Real's face is hidden by a vessel formed of golden light.  \nThe Spirit yonder in the Sun, the Spirit dwelling there am I.  \nOM! Heaven! Brahma!\n\np. 309\n\np. 310\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Index of Hymns and Verses Taken from the Rigveda and the Atharva-\nveda](wyvxref.htm)\n\n"
