 \nHow can a cord attract his eyes  \nWho gives away the nobler prize?  \nBest of the good, with me he led  \nNo host, my King with banners spread.  \nAll wealth, all lordship I resign:  \nThe hermit's dress alone be mine.  \nBefore I go, have here conveyed  \nA little basket and a spade.  \nWith these alone I go, content,  \nFor fourteen years of banishment.'  \n\nWith her own hands Kaikeyi took  \nThe hermit coats of bark, and, 'Look,'  \nShe cried with bold unblushing brow  \nBefore the concourse, 'Dress thee now.'  \nThat lion leader of the brave  \nTook from her hand the dress she gave,  \nCast his fine raiment on the ground,  \n\np. 139  \n\nAnd round his waist the vesture bound.  \nThen quick the hero Lakshman too  \nHis garment from his shoulders threw,  \nAnd, in the presence of his sire,  \nIndued the ascetic's rough attire.  \nBut Sita, in her silks arrayed,  \nThrew glances, trembling and afraid,  \nOn the bark coat she had to wear,  \nLike a shy doe that eyes the snare.  \nAshamed and weeping for distress  \nFrom the queen's hand she took the dress.  \nThe fair one, by her husband's side  \nWho matched heaven's minstrel monarch,  1 cried:  \n'How bind they on their woodland dress,  \nThose hermits of the wilderness?'  \n\nThere stood the pride of Janak's race  \nPerplexed, with sad appealing face.  \nOne coat the lady's fingers grasped,  \nOne round her neck she feebly clasped,  \nBut failed again, again, confused  \nBy the wild garb she ne'er had used.  \nThen quickly hastening Rama, pride  \nOf all who cherish virtue, tied  \nThe rough bark mantle on her, o'er  \nThe silken raiment that she wore.  \n\nThen the sad women when they saw  \nRama the choice bark round her draw,  \nRained water from each tender eye,  \nAnd cried aloud with bitter cry:  \n'O, not on her, beloved, not  \nOn Sita falls thy mournful lot.  \nIf, faithful to thy father's will,  \nThou must go forth, leave Sita still.  \nLet Sita still remaining here  \nOur hearts with her loved presence cheer.  \nWith Lakshman by thy side to aid  \nSeek thou, dear son, the lonely shade.  \nUnmeet, one good and fair as she  \nShould dwell in woods a devotee.  \nLet not our prayers be prayed in vain:  \nLet beauteous Sita yet remain;  \nFor by thy love of duty tied  \nThou wilt not here thyself abide.'  \n\nThen the king's venerable guide  \nVas'ishtha, when he saw each coat  \nEnclose the lady's waist and throat,  \nHer zeal with gentle words repressed,  \nAnd Queen Kaikeyi thus addressed:  \n'O evil-hearted sinner, shame  \nOf royal Kekaya's race and name;  \nWho matchless in thy sin couldst cheat  \nThy lord the king with vile deceit;  \nLost to all sense of duty, know  \nSita to exile shall not go.  \nSita shall guard, as 'twere her own,  \nThe precious trust of Rama's throne.  \n\nThose joined by wedlock's sweet control  \nHave but one self and common soul.  \nThus Sita shall our empress be,  \nFor Rama's self and soul is she.  \nOr if she still to Rama cleave  \nAnd for the woods the kingdom leave:  \nIf naught her loving heart deter,  \nWe and this town will follow her.  \nThe warders of the queen shall take  \nTheir wives and go for Rama's sake,  \nThe nation with its stores of grain,  \nThe city's wealth shall swell his train.  \nBharat, S'atrughna both will wear  \nBark mantles, and his lodging share,  \nStill with their elder brother dwell  \nIn the wild wood, and serve him well.  \nRest here alone, and rule thy state  \nUnpeopled, barren, desolate;  \nBe empress of the land and trees,  \nThou sinner whom our sorrows please.  \nThe land which Rama reigns not o'er  \nShall bear the kingdom's name no more:  \nThe woods which Rama wanders through  \nShall be our home and kingdom too.  \nBharat, be sure, will never deign  \nO'er realms his father yields, to reign.  \nNay, if the king's true son he be,  \nHe will not, sonlike, dwell with thee.  \nNay, shouldst thou from the earth arise,  \nAnd send thy message from the skies,  \nTo his forefathers' custom true  \nNo erring course would he pursue.  \nSo hast thou, by thy grievous fault,  \nOffended him thou wouldst exalt.  \nIn all the world none draws his breath  \nWho loves not Rama, true to death.  \nThis day, O Queen, shalt thou behold  \nBirds, deer, and beasts from lea and fold  \nTurn to the woods in Rama's train.  \nAnd naught save longing trees remain.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[139:1](ry115.htm#fr_312) Chitraratha, King of the celestial choristers.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXVIII.: Care For Kaus'alya](ry116.htm)\n\n"
