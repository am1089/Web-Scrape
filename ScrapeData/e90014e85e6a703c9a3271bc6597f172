Inequality (of dispensation) and cruelty (the Lord can)not (be reproached\nwith), on account of\n\np. 358\n\nhis regarding (merit and demerit); for so (Scripture) declares.\n\nIn order to strengthen the tenet which we are at present defending, we follow\nthe procedure of him who shakes a pole planted in the ground (in order to test\nwhether it is firmly planted), and raise another objection against the\ndoctrine of the Lord being the cause of the world.--The Lord, it is said,\ncannot be the cause of the world, because, on that hypothesis, the reproach of\ninequality of dispensation and cruelty would attach to him. Some beings, viz.\nthe gods and others, he renders eminently happy; others, as for instance the\nanimals, eminently unhappy; to some again, as for instance men, he allots an\nintermediate position. To a Lord bringing about such an unequal condition of\nthings, passion and malice would have to be ascribed, just as to any common\nperson acting similarly; which attributes would be contrary to the essential\ngoodness of the Lord affirmed by _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti. Moreover, as the\ninfliction of pain and the final destruction of all creatures would form part\nof his dispensation, he would have to be taxed with great cruelty, a quality\nabhorred by low people even. For these two reasons Brahman cannot be the cause\nof the world.\n\nThe Lord, we reply, cannot be reproached with inequality of dispensation and\ncruelty, "because he is bound by regards." If the Lord on his own account,\nwithout any extraneous regards, produced this unequal creation, he would\nexpose himself to blame; but the fact is, that in creating he is bound by\ncertain regards, i. e. he has to look to merit and demerit. Hence the\ncircumstance of the creation being unequal is due to the merit and demerit of\nthe living creatures created, and is not a fault for which the Lord is to\nblame. The position of the Lord is to be looked on as analogous to that of Par\n_g_ anya, the Giver of rain. For as Par _g_ anya is the common cause of the\nproduction of rice, barley, and other plants, while the difference between the\nvarious species is due to the various potentialities lying hidden in the\nrespective seeds, so the Lord is the common cause of the creation of gods,\nmen, &c., while the differences between these classes of beings\n\np. 359\n\nare due to the different merit belonging to the individual souls. Hence the\nLord, being bound by regards, cannot be reproached with inequality of\ndispensation and cruelty.--And if we are asked how we come to know that the\nLord, in creating this world with its various conditions, is bound by regards,\nwe reply that Scripture declares that; compare, for instance, the two\nfollowing passages, \'For he (the Lord) makes him, whom he wishes to lead up\nfrom these worlds, do a good deed; and the same makes him, whom he wishes to\nlead down from these worlds, do a bad deed\' (Kaush. Up. III, 8) 1; and, \'A man\nbecomes good by good work, bad by bad work\' (B _ri_. Up. III, 2, 13). Sm _ri_\nti passages also declare the favour of the Lord and its opposite to depend on\nthe different quality of the works of living beings; so, for instance, \'I\nserve men in the way in which they approach me\' (Bha. Gi. IV, 11).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[359:1](sbe34173.htm#fr_316) From this passage we must not--the commentators\nsay--infer injustice on the part of the Lord; for the previous merit or\ndemerit of a being determines the specific quality of the actions which he\nperforms in his present existence, the Lord acting as the common cause only\n(as Par _g_ anya does).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 35](sbe34174.htm)\n\n'
