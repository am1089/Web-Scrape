(The soul passes through the stages of its descent) in a not very long\ntime; on account of the special statement.\n\nA doubt arises with reference to the period beginning with the soul's becoming\nether and extending up to its entering into rice, &c., viz. whether the soul\nremains a long time in the state of similarity to each of the stages of its\nway before it enters into similarity to the next one, or only a short time.--\nThe purvapakshin maintains that, on account of the absence of a definite text,\nno binding rule exists.--To this we reply that the souls remain in the state\nof similarity to ether. &c., for a short period only before they fall to the\nearth in raindrops. We infer this from the circumstance of the text making a\nspecial statement. For after having said that the souls enter into rice, &c.,\nit adds, 'From thence the escape is beset with more pain;' a statement\nimplying that the escape from the previous states was comparatively easy and\npleasant. Now this difference in point of pleasantness must be based on the\ncomparative shortness or length of the escape; for as, at that time, the body\nis not yet formed, enjoyment (in the ordinary sense) is not possible. Hence we\nconclude that, up to the moment when the souls enter into rice, &c., their\ndescent is accomplished in a short time.\n\np. 129\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 24](sbe38100.htm)\n\n"
