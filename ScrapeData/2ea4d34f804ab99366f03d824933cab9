Parmenides.--The opportunity here presents itself to point to the\nsingularly close parallel between Upanishadic thought and the doctrines of the\nearly Eleatic philosophers, and especially Parmenides, who may well have been\ncontemporary with the authors of some of the most important Upanishads.\nFollowing Xenophanes, who had defined God as eternal, one, and neither in\nmotion nor immobile, Parmenides asserts a single universal Being which is\nidentical with thought. Existence is a whole indivisible in space and time;\nnon-being does not exist. "Thus there remains but one way to tell of, namely\nthat Being _is._ There are many tokens to show that it is unborn and\nimperishable, whole, only-begotten, unshakeable, and endless. Never _was_ it\nnor _will_ it be, for it exists entirely in present time, one and indivisible\xe2\x80\xa6\nThus it must exist either absolutely or not at all. The power of belief can\nnever admit that from non-being anything else (but non-being) could arise\xe2\x80\xa6 And\nit (viz., being) is not divisible, for it is identical throughout; nor is\nthere any higher (being) that could prevent its uniformity, nor any less; it\nis entirely full of being. So it is wholly uniform, for being unites with\nbeing. But it is immobile in the limitations of mighty bonds, beginningless\n\np. 35\n\nand endless; for birth and destruction have been driven very far away, right\nconviction has rejected them. It abides the same in the same and by itself,\nand thus remains constantly in its place\xe2\x80\xa6 Thought and the object of thought\nare the same, for you cannot find thought without the existent thing in which\nit is expressed. There is and can be nothing except being, for fate has bound\nit down to be whole and immobile. Thus all (ideas) that men have set up,\nbelieving them to be true--birth and death, being and non-being, change of\nplace, and alteration of bright hue--are mere words" (fragment 8, ed. Diels);\ncf. fragment 5, "thought (of being) and being are the same," fragment 6,\n"speech and thought must be real, for being exists and a naught does not\nexist," fragment 7, "non-being can never be proved to exist." Except in his\nview of Being as a sphere, Parmenides is in perfect accord with the Ved\xc4\x81nta.\nThe similarity of Plato\'s doctrines is well known.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Phases of the Self](brk18.htm)\n\n'
