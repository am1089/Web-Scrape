To him the Vedas yield no more milk, he has no luck in what he has learnt\n(from his Guru); he does not know the path of virtue.\n\n2\\. This has also been declared by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. X, 71, 6):--\n\n3\\. 'He who has forsaken the friend (the Veda), that knows his friends, in his\nspeech there is no luck. Though he hears, he hears in vain, for he does not\nknow the path of virtue.'\n\n4\\. Here it is clearly said that he has no luck in what he has learnt, and\nthat he does not know the path of virtue.\n\n5\\. Therefore let no one who knows this, lay the sacrificial fire (belonging\nto the Mahavrata) for another, let him not sing the Samans of the Mahavrata\n\np. 261\n\nfor another, let him not recite the Sastras of that day for another.\n\n6\\. However, let him willingly do this for a father or for an \xc3\x82 _k_ arya; for\nthat is done really for himself.\n\n7\\. We have said that the incorporeal conscious self and the sun are one 1.\nWhen these two become separated 2, the sun is seen as if it were the moon 3;\nno rays spring from it; the sky is red like madder; the patient cannot retain\nthe wind, his head smells bad like a raven's nest:--let him know then that his\nself (in the body) is gone, and that he will not live very long 4.\n\n8\\. Then whatever he thinks he has to do,. let him do it, and let him recite\nthe following hymns: Yad anti ya _k_ _k_ a durake (Rv. IX, 67, 21-27); Ad it\npratnasya retasa _h_ (Rv. VIII, 6, 30); Yatra brahma pavamana (Rv. IX, 113,\n6-11); Ud vaya _m_ tamasas pari (Rv. I, 50, 10).\n\n9\\. Next, when the sun is seen pierced, and seems like the nave of a cart-\nwheel, when he sees his own shadow pierced, let him know then that it is so\n(as stated before, i. e. that he is going to die soon).\n\n10\\. Next, when he sees himself in a mirror or in the water with a crooked\nhead, or without a head 5, or when his pupils are seen inverted 6 or not\nstraight, let him know then that it is so.\n\np. 262\n\n11\\. Next, let him cover his eyes and watch, then threads are seen as if\nfalling together 1. But if he does not see them, let him know then that it is\nso.\n\n12\\. Next, let him cover his ears and listen, and there will be a sound as if\nof a burning fire or of a carriage 2. But if he does not hear it, let him know\nthen that it is so.\n\n13\\. Next, when fire looks blue like the neck of a peacock 3, or when he sees\nlightning in a cloudless sky, or no lightning in a clouded sky, or when he\nsees as it were bright rays in a dark cloud, let him know then that it is so.\n\n14\\. Next, when he sees the ground as if it were burning, let him know that it\nis so.\n\n15\\. These are the visible signs (from 7-14).\n\n16\\. Next come the dreams 4.\n\n17\\. If he sees a black man with black teeth, and that man kills him; or a\nboar kills him; a monkey jumps on 5 him; the wind carries him along quickly;\nhaving swallowed gold he spits it out 6; he eats honey; he chews stalks; he\ncarries a red lotus; he drives with asses and boars; wearing a wreath of red\nflowers (naladas) he drives a black cow with a black calf, facing the south 7,\n\n18\\. If a man sees any one of these (dreams), let\n\np. 263\n\nhim fast, and cook a pot of milk, sacrifice it, accompanying each oblation\nwith a verse of the Ratri hymn (Rv. X, 12 7), and then, after having fed the\nBrahma _n_ as, with other food (prepared at his house) eat himself the (rest\nof the) oblation.\n\n19\\. Let him know that the person within all beings, not heard here 1, not\nreached, not thought, not subdued, not seen, not understood, not classed, but\nhearing, thinking, seeing, classing, sounding, understanding, knowing, is his\nSelf.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[261:1](sbe01236.htm#fr_663) Ait. \xc3\x82r.
