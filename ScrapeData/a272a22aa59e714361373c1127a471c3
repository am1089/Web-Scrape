[1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n11:1:1\n\np. 1\n\n# _S_ ATAPATHA-BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n## ELEVENTH K\xc3\x82 _N_ _D_ A.\n\n#### THE FULL AND NEW-MOON SACRIFICE.\n\n### FIRST ADHY\xc3\x82YA. FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n11:1:1:11\\. Verily, Pra _g_ apati, the Sacrifice, is the Year: the night of\nnew moon is its gate, and the moon itself is the bolt of the gate.\n\n11:1:1:22\\. And when one lays down the two fires at new moon 1,--even as one\nwould enter a stronghold by the gate, when the gate is open, and would thence\nreach the world of heaven, so it is when one lays down the fires at new moon.\n\n11:1:1:32\\. And if one lays down the fires under a (special) asterism 2,--just\nas if one tried to enter a stronghold, when the gate is closed, in some other\nway than through the gate, and failed to get inside the stronghold, so it is\nwhen one lays down the fires under an asterism: let him therefore not lay down\nthe fires under an asterism.\n\n11:1:1:44\\. On the same day on which that one (the moon) should not be seen\neither in the east or in the west,\n\np. 2\n\nlet him fast, for it is then that he (the moon) comes to this world 1, and on\nthat (day) he abides here (on the sacrificial ground).\n\n11:1:1:55\\. And all the gods abide (here), all the spirits, all the deities,\nall the seasons, all the Stomas (hymn-forms), all the P _ri_ sh _th_ as 2, and\nall the metres.\n\n11:1:1:66\\. And, verily, it is for all the gods, for all spirits, for all\ndeities, for all seasons, for all Stomas, for all P _ri_ sh _th_ as, and for\nall metres that the fires of him are laid down who lays them down at new moon:\nhe should therefore lay them down at new moon.\n\n11:1:1:77\\. He may lay down the fires on the new moon which falls in the\n(month) Vai _s_ akha, for that coincides with the Rohi _n_ i (asterism); for\nthe Rohi _n_ i means the self, offspring and cattle 3: he thus becomes\nestablished in a self, in offspring and cattle. But, indeed, the new moon is\nthe form of the Agnyadheya: let him therefore lay down the fires at new\nmoon;--let him perform the preliminary ceremony 4 at full moon, and the\ninitiation ceremony at new moon.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](sbe44003.htm#fr_69) For the performance of the Agnyadhana, or setting up\nthe sacrificial fires, see part i, p. 274 seqq.\n\n[1:2](sbe44003.htm#fr_70) For the Nakshatras, or lunar mansions, under which\nthe Agnyadhana may be performed, see II, 1, 2, 1 seqq., and especially II, 1,\n2, 19, where the practice of regulating the time of the ceremony by the\nNakshatras is discouraged.\n\n[2:1](sbe44003.htm#fr_71) See I, 6, 4, 5.\n\n[2:2](sbe44003.htm#fr_72) For the six P _ri_ sh _th_ a-samans, see part iii,\nintrod., p. xx seqq.\n\n[2:3](sbe44003.htm#fr_73) See II, 1, 2, 6. 7.\n\n[2:4](sbe44003.htm#fr_74) For the Anvarambha _n_ iya-ish _t_ i, lit.
