Praise of an amulet derived from the parna-tree, designed to\nstrengthen royal power.\n\n1\\. Hither hath come this amulet of parna-wood, with its might mightily\ncrushing the enemy. (It is) the strength of the gods, the sap of the waters:\nmay it assiduously enliven me with energy!  \n2\\. The power to rule thou shalt hold fast in me, O amulet of parna-wood;\nwealth (thou shalt hold fast) in me! May I, rooted in the domain of royalty,\nbecome the chief!  \n3\\. Their very own amulet which the gods deposited secretly in the tree, that\nthe gods shall give us to wear, together with life!  \n4\\. The parna has come hither as the mighty strength of the soma, given by\nIndra, instructed by Varuna. May I, shining brilliantly, wear it, unto long\nlife, during a hundred autumns!  \n5\\. The amulet of parna-wood has ascended upon me unto complete exemption from\ninjury, that I may rise superior (even) to friends and alliances!  \n6\\. The skilful builders of chariots, and the ingenious workers of metal, the\nfolk about me all, do thou, O parna, make my aids!  \n7\\. The kings who (themselves) make kings, the charioteers, and leaders of\nhosts, the folk about me all, do thou, O parna, make my aids!  \n8\\. Thou art the body-protecting parna, a 'liero, brother of me, the hero.\nAlong with the brilliancy of the year do I fasten thee on, O amulet!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 22.
