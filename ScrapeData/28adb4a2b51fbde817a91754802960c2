A merchant's prayer.\n\n1\\. Indra, the merchant, do I summon: may he come to us, may he be our van;\ndriving away the demon of grudge, the waylayers, and wild beasts, may he, the\npossessor, bestow wealth upon me!  \n2\\. May the many paths, the roads of the gods, which come together between\nheaven and earth, c,ladden me with milk and ghee, so that I may gather in\nwealth from my purchases!  \n3\\. Desirous do I, O Agni, with firewood and ghee offer oblations (to thee),\nfor success and strength; according to ability praising (thee) with my prayer,\ndo I sing this divine song, that I may gain a hundredfold!  \n4\\. (Pardon, O Agni, this sin of ours [incurred upon] the far road which we\nhave travelled!) May our purchases and our sales be successful for us; may\nwhat I get in barter render me a gainer! May ye two (Indra and Agni) in accord\ntake pleasure in this oblation! May our transactions and the accruing gain be\nauspicious to us!  \n5\\. The wealth with which I go to purchase, desiring, ye gods, to gain wealth\nthrough wealth, may that grow more, not less! Drive away, O Agni, in return\nfor the oblation, the gods who shut off gain!  \n6\\. The wealth with which I go to purchase, desiring, ye gods, to gain wealth\nthrough wealth, may Indra, Pragapati, Savitar, Soma, Agni, place lustre into\nit for me!  \n7\\. We praise with reverence thee, O priest (Agni) Vaisvdnara. Do thou over\nour children, selves, cattle, and life's breath watch!  \n8\\. Daily, never failing, shall we bring (oblations to thee), O Gatavedas, (as\nif fodder) to a horse standing (in the stable). In growth of wealth and\nnutriment rejoicing, may we, O Agni, thy neighbours, not take harm!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 38. A. Prayer for success in gambling](av178.htm)\n\n"
