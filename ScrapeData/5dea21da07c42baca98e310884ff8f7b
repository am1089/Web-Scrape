Not in the symbol; for (the symbol) is not that one (i.e. the Self of the\nDevotee).\n\n'Let a man meditate on mind as Brahman ' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 18, 1); 'He who\nmeditates on name as Brahman' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, l5)--with regard to these and\nsimilar meditations on outward symbols (pratika) of Brahman there arises a\ndoubt, viz. whether in them the symbols are to be thought of as of the nature\nof Self or not. The Purvapakshin\n\np. 719\n\nholds the former view. For, he says, in form those injunctions do not differ\nfrom other injunctions of meditation on Brahman, and Brahman, as we have seen,\nconstitutes the Self of the meditating Devotee.--This view the Sutra sets\naside. A pratika cannot be meditated on as being of the nature of Self; for\nthe pratika is not the Self of the meditating Devotee. What, in those\nmeditations, is to be meditated upon is the pratika only, not Brahman: the\nlatter enters into the meditation only as qualifying its aspect. For by a\nmeditation on a pratika we understand a meditation in which something that is\nnot Brahman is viewed under the aspect of Brahman, and as the pratika--the\nobject of meditation--is not the Self of the Devotee it cannot be viewed under\nthat form.--But an objection is raised here also, it is Brahman which is the\nreal object of meditation; for where Brahman _may_ be viewed as the object of\nmeditation, it is inappropriate to assume as objects non-sentient things of\nsmall power such as the mind, and so on. The object of meditation therefore is\nBrahman viewed under the aspect of mind, and so on.--This objection the next\nSutra disposes of.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 5.
