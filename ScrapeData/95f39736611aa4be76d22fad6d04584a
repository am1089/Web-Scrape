( _cont_.)\n\n101\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CI.\n\nFor these two last portions he makes the indication of the deity.\n\n101c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nWith the earlier portions, there is a rule which of two gods should have the\nfirst or the second portion. With the last couple, however, the priest may\nhimself assign whichever portion he likes to one or the other god. The\ncommentary says, svayam eva idam asya iti sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpayet.\n\n102\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CII.\n\nWhen there is a number of _K_ arus and Puro _d_ a _s_ as, one separates what\nbelongs to the _K_ arus and what belongs to the Puro _d_ a _s_ as, before the\nstrewing.\n\n102c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nPrag adhivapanat, before the strewing, is explained by prag adhivapanarthak\n_ri_ sh _n_ a _g_ inadanat, before one takes the black skin which is used for\nthe strewing.\n\n103\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CIII.\n\nOne then marks the two (the materials for the Karus and the Puro _d_ a _s_ as)\naccording to the deities (for whom they are intended).\n\n104\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CIV.\n\nLet the word idam be the rule.\n\n104c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThis means that the offering (havis) intended for each deity should be pointed\nout by the words idam, this, Agne _h_ , is for Agni, &c. Thus we read with\nregard to the offerings intended for certain gods and goddesses: ida _m_\nDhatur, idam Anumatya, Rakaya _h_ Sinivalya _h_ , Kuhva _h_.\n\np. 344\n\n105\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CV.\n\nAll this applies also to _K_ arus and Puro _d_ a _s_ as which are separated.\n\n105c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe commentary explains vyatishikta by anyonya _m_ vyavahita, though it is\ndifficult to see how it can have that meaning. It is said that in the Vai _s_\nvadeva the _K_ arus and Puro _d_ a _s_ as are vyatishikta, but that they also\nhave to be divided before the adhivapana, and to be marked for each deity.\nThus we read: Idam Agne _h_ , Savitu _h_ , Push _n_ o, Maruta _m_ , Dyavap\n_ri_ thivyo _h_ , &c.\n\n106\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CVI.\n\nAt the time when the Kapalas are put on the fire, one puts on the karu with\nthe first kapala verse.\n\n106c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nKaru is here used for the vessel for boiling the _k_ aru, the _k_ arusthali.\nThe first of these verses is dh _ri_ sh _t_ ir asi. Kapalas are the jars in\nwhich the rice is cooked.\n\n107\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CVII.\n\nThe verse is adapted and changed to dhruvo\xe0\xa4\xbdsi.\n\n107c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nSa _m_ nama means the same as uha, i.e. the modification of a verse so as to\nadapt it to the object for which it is used. In our case, _k_ aru, being a\nmasculine, dh _ri_ sh _t_ i, a feminine, is replaced by dhruva, a masculine.\n\n108\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CVIII.\n\nAt the time when the meal is to be cleansed, one cleanses the grains.\n\n108c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThis takes place after the _k_ aru-pot has been put on. The ta _n_ _d_ ulas\nare the unhusked grains, pish _t_ a is the\n\np. 345\n\nground flour. In Sanskrit a distinction is made between _s_ asya, the corn in\nthe field, dhanya, corn with the husk, ta _n_ _d_ ula, grains without husks,\nanna, roasted grains.\n\n109\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CIX.\n\nAt the time of cooking (adhi _s_ rapa _n_ a) one throws the grains in with the\ncooking verse.\n\nCommentary. This verse is gharmo\xe0\xa4\xbdsi.\n\n110\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CX.\n\nWithout taking the _k_ aru (out of the sthali) one puts it down.\n\n111\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXI.\n\nAt the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa sacrifices there are fifteen Samidhenis.\n\n111c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nSamidhenis are particular verses recited while the fire is being kindled. The\nfirst and last verses are repeated thrice, so as to make fifteen in all.\n\n112\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CII.\n\nAt the Ish _t_ i and Pa _s_ ubandha sacrifices there are seventeen Samidhenis,\nwhen they are so handed down.\n\n113\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXIII.\n\nWhen it is said that wishful ish _t_ is are performed in a murmur, this means\nthat the names of the chief deities are pronounced in a murmur (likewise the\nya _g_ ya and anuvakya).\n\n114\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXIV.\n\nThe Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa sacrifice is the Prak _ri_ ti or norm for all ish\n_t_ is.\n\np. 346\n\n114c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe Sutras, in describing the performance of certain sacrifices, treat some of\nthem in full detail. These are called prak _ri_ ti. Prak _ri_ yante\xe0\xa4\xbdsmin\ndharma iti prakara _n_ am prak _ri_ ti _h_. They form the type of other\nsacrifices, which are therefore looked upon as mere modifications, vik _ri_\nti, and in describing them those points only are fully described in which they\ndiffer from their prak _ri_ ti. A sacrifice which is a vik _ri_ ti, may again\nbecome the prak _ri_ ti of another sacrifice. This system is no doubt\ncompendious, but it is not free from difficulty, and, in some cases, from\nuncertainty. It shows how much system there is in the Indian sacrifices, and\nhow fully and minutely that system must have been elaborated, before it\nassumed that form in which we find it in the Brahma _n_ as and Sutras. It must\nnot be supposed that the sacrifices which serve as prak _ri_ ti, are therefore\nhistorically the most ancient.\n\n115\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXV.\n\nIt is also the norm for the Agnishomiya Pa _s_ u, the animal sacrifice for\nAgni-Shomau.\n\n116\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXVI.\n\nAnd this is the norm for the Savaniya.\n\n117\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXVII.\n\nAnd the Savaniya is the norm for the Aikada _s_ inas.\n\n118\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXVIII.\n\nAnd the Aikada _s_ inas are the norm for the Pa _s_ uga _n_ as.\n\n118c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe rules for the Pa _s_ uga _n_ as are therefore to be taken over from the\nAikada _s_ inas, the Savaniya, the Agnishomiya-pa _s_ u, and the Dar _s_ a-pur\n_n_ amasa, so far as they have been modified in each particular case, and are\n\np. 347\n\nfinally determined by the rules of each Pa _s_ uga _n_ a, as, for instance,\nthe \xc3\x82ditya-pa _s_ u.\n\n119\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXIX.\n\nThe Vai _s_ vadeva is the norm for the Varu _n_ a-praghasa, Sakamedha, and\nSira.\n\n119c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe Vai _s_ vadeva, beginning, like the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa, with an\n\xc3\x82gneya ash _t_ akapala, takes certain rules from the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa,\nand transfers these, together with its own, as, for instance, the nine praya\n_g_ as, to the Varu _n_ a-praghasa, &c.\n\n120\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXX.\n\nThe Vai _s_ vadevika Ekakapala is the norm for all Ekakapalas.\n\n120c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe Ekakapala is a puro _d_ a _s_ a cake, baked in one kapala. It is fully\ndescribed in the Vai _s_ vadeva, and then becomes the norm of all Ekakapalas.\nAn ekakapala cake is not divided.\n\n121\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXI.\n\nThe Vai _s_ vadevi \xc3\x82miksha is the norm for the \xc3\x82mikshas (a preparation of\nmilk).\n\n122\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXII.\n\nHere the Vikara, the modification, is perceived from similarity.\n\n122c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIf it has once been laid down that the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa is the prak\n_ri_ ti or norm for all ish _t_ is, then similarity determines the\nmodification in all details, such as the offerings and the gods to whom\nofferings are made. Thus Karu, being a vegetable offering, would rank as a\nvikara of puro _d_ a _s_ a, which occurs in the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa\nsacrifice, and is likewise vegetable. Honey and water\n\np. 348\n\nwould be looked upon as most like the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya in the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa.\n\xc3\x82miksha, a preparation of milk, would come nearest to the Sa _m_ nayya, which\nis a mixture of sour and sweet milk.\n\n123\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXIII.\n\nOfferings for one deity are vikaras of the \xc3\x82gneya.\n\n123c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIn the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa, which is the prak _ri_ ti of the ish _t_ is,\nthe puro _d_ a _s_ a for Agni is meant for one deity. Hence all offerings to\none deity in the vik _ri_ tis follow the general rules of the \xc3\x82gneya puro _d_\na _s_ a, as described in the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa, for instance, the karu\nfor Surya, the Dvada _s_ a-kapala for Savitri.\n\n124\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXIV.\n\nOfferings for two deities are vikaras of the Agnishomiya.\n\n124c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThey must, however, be vegetable offerings, because the puro _d_ a _s_ a for\nAgni-Shomau is a vegetable offering. As an instance, the \xc3\x82gnavaish _n_ ava\nEkada _s_ akapala is quoted. Agnishomiya has a short a, but the first a in\nagnavaish _n_ ava is long.\n\n125\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXV.\n\nOfferings for many deities are vikaras also of the Aindragna.\n\n125c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe _k_ a in bahudevata _s_ _k_ a is explained by the commentary as intended\nto include the \xc3\x82gnavaish _n_ ava also. Any offering intended for more than one\ndeity may be considered as intended for many deities.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sutras 126-150](sbe30124.htm)\n\n"
