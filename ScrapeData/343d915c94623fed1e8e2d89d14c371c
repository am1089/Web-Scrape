Allow  \nMy husband to complete his vow;  \nLet us returning, I entreat,  \nKaus\'alya and Sumitra meet.\'  \nThen with her hands together placed  \nAround the tree she duly paced.  \nWhen Rama saw his blameless spouse  \nA suppliant under holy boughs,  \nThe gentle darling of his heart,  \nHe thus to Lakshman spake apart:  \n\'Brother, by thee our way be led;  \nLet Sita close behind thee tread:  \nI, best of men, will grasp my bow,  \nAnd hindmost of the three will go.  \nWhat fruits soe\'er her fancy take,  \nOr flowers half hidden in the brake,  \nFor Janak\'s child forget not thou  \nTo gather from the brake or bough."  \n\nThus on they fared. The tender dame  \nAsked Rama, as they walked, the name  \nOf every shrub that blossoms bore,  \nCreeper, and tree unseen before:  \nAnd Lakshman fetched, at Sita\'s prayer,  \nBoughs of each tree with clusters fair.  \nThen Janak\'s daughter joyed to see  \nThe sand-discoloured river flee,  \nWhere the glad cry of many a bird,  \nThe sa\'ras and the swan, was heard.  \nA league the brothers travelled through  \nThe forest noble game they slew:  \nBeneath the trees their meal they dressed  \nAnd sat them down to eat and rest.  \nA while in that delightful shade  \nWhere elephants unnumbered strayed.  \nWhere peacocks screamed and monkeys played.  \n\np. 161  \n\n   They wandered with delight.  \nThen by the river\'s side they found  \nA pleaaant spot of level ground,  \nWhere all was smooth and fair around,  \n   Their lodging for the night.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[160:1](ry133.htm#fr_330) Another name of the Jumna, daughter of the Sun.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LVI.: Chitrakuta.](ry134.htm)\n\n'
