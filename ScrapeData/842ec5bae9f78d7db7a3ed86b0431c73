Foisoned (sic) the fields;  \nLonely and rich the forests and the swaying  \nOf those unnumbered tops affected men  \nWith thoughts to their vast music kin. Undammed  \nThe virgin rivers moved towards the sea,  \nAnd mountains yet unseen and peoples vague  \nWinged young imagination like an eagle  \nTo strange beauty remote. And Ruru felt  \nThe sweetness of the early earth as sap  \nAll through him, and short life an aeon made p. 2  \nBy boundless possibility, and love,  \nSweetest of all unfathomable love,  \nA glory untired. As a bright bird comes flying  \nFrom airy extravagance to his own home,  \nAnd breasts his mate, and feels her all his goal,  \nSo from boon sunlight and the fresh chill wave  \nWhich swirled and lapped between the slumbering fields,  \nFrom forest pools and wanderings mid leaves  \nThrough emerald ever-new discoveries,  \nMysterious hillsides ranged and buoyant-swift  \nRaces with our wild brothers in the meads,  \nCame Ruru back to the white-bosomed girl,  \nStrong-winged to pleasure. She all fresh and new  \nRose to him, and he plunged into her charm.  \nFor neither to her honey and poignancy  \nArtlessly interchanged, nor any limit  \nTo the sweet physical delight of her  \nHe found. Her eyes like deep and infinite wells  \nLured his attracted soul, and her touch thrilled  \nNot lightly, though so light; the joy prolonged  \nAnd sweetness of the lingering of her lips  \nWas every time a nectar of surprise  \nTo her lover; her smooth-gleaming shoulder bared  \nIn darkness of her hair showed jasmine-bright,  \nWhile her kissed bosom by rich tumults stirred  \nWas a moved sea that rocked beneath his heart,  \nThen when her lips had made him blind, soft siege  \nOf all her unseen body to his rule  \nBetrayed the ravishing realm of her white limbs,  \nAn empire for the glory of a God.  \nHe knew not whether he loved most her smile,  \nHer causeless tears or little angers swift,  \nWhether held wet against him from the bath  \nAmong her kindred lotuses, her cheeks  \nSoft to his lips and dangerous happy breasts  \nThat vanquished all his strength with their desire,  \nMeeting his absence with her sudden face,  \nOr when the leaf-hid bird at night complained  \nNear their wreathed arbour on the moonlit lake,  \nSobbing delight out from her heart of bliss, p. 3  \nOr in his clasp of rapture laughing low  \nOf his close bosom bridal-glad and pleased  \nWith passion and this fiery play of love,  \nOr breaking off like one who thinks of grief,  \nWonderful melancholy in her eyes  \nGrown liquid and with wayward sorrow large,  \nThus he in her found a warm world of sweets,  \nAnd lived of ecstasy secure, nor deemed  \nAny new hour could match that early bliss.  \nBut Love has joys for spirits born divine  \nMore bleeding-lovely than his thornless rose.  \nThat day he had left, while yet the east was dark,  \nRising, her bosom and into the river  \nSwam out, exulting in the sting and swift  \nSharp-edged desire around his limbs, and sprang  \nWet to the bank, and streamed into the wood.  \nAs a young horse upon the pastures glad  \nFeels greensward and the wind along his mane  \nAnd arches as he goes his neck, so went  \nIn an immense delight of youth the boy  \nAnd shook his locks, joy-crested. Boundlessly  \nHe revelled in swift air of life, a creature  \nOf wide and vigorous morning. Far he strayed  \nTempting for flower and fruit branches in heaven,  \nAnd plucked, and flung away, and brighter chose,  \nSeeking comparisons for her bloom; and followed  \nNew streams, and touched new trees, and felt slow beauty  \nAnd leafy secret change; for the damp leaves,  \nGrey-green at first, grew pallid with the light  \nAnd warmed with consciousness of sunshine near;  \nThen the whole daylight wandered in, and made  \nHard tracts of splendour, and enriched all hues.  \nBut when a happy sheltered heat he felt  \nAnd heard contented voice of living things  \nHarmonious with the noon, he turned and swiftly  \nWent homeward yearning to Priyumvada,  \nAnd near his home emerging from green leaves  \nHe laughed towards the sun: "O father Sun,"  \nHe cried, "how good it is to live, to love!  \nSurely our joy shall never end, nor we p. 4  \nGrow old, but like bright rivers or pure winds  \nSweetly continue, or revive with flowers,  \nOr live at least as long as senseless trees."  \nHe dreamed, and said with a soft smile: "Lo, she!  \nAnd she will turn from me with angry tears  \nHer delicate face more beautiful than storm  \nOr rainy moonlight. I will follow her,  \nAnd soothe her heart with sovereign flatteries;  \nOr rather all tyranny exhaust and taste  \nThe beauty of her anger like a fruit,  \nVexing her soul with helplessness; then soften  \nEasily with quiet undenied demand  \nOf heart insisting upon heart; or else  \nWill reinvest her beauty bright with flowers,  \nOr with my hands her little feet persuade.  \nThen will her face be like a sudden dawn,  \nAnd flower compelled into reluctant smiles."  \nHe had not ceased when he beheld her. She,  \nTearing a jasmine bloom with waiting hands,  \nStood drooping, petulant, but heard at once  \nHis footsteps and before she was aware,  \nA sudden smile of exquisite delight  \nLeaped to her mouth, and a great blush of joy  \nSurprised her cheeks. She for a moment stood  \nBeautiful with her love before she died;  \nAnd he laughed towards her. With a pitiful cry  \nShe paled; moaning, her stricken limbs collapsed.  \nBut petrified, in awful dumb surprise,  \nHe gazed; then waking with a bound was by her,  \nAll panic expectation. As he came,  \nHe saw a brilliant flash of coils evade  \nThe sunlight, and with hateful gorgeous hood  \nDarted into green safety, hissing, death.  \nVoiceless he sank beside her and stretched out  \nHis arms and desperately touched her face,  \nAs if to attract her soul to live, and sought  \nBeseeching with his hands her bosom. O, she  \nWas warm, and cruel hope pierced him; but pale  \nAs jasmines fading on a girl\'s sweet breast  \nHer cheek was, and forgot its perfect rose. p. 5  \nHer eyes that clung to sunlight yet, with pain  \nWere large and feebly round his neck her arms  \nShe lifted and, desiring his pale cheek  \nAgainst her bosom, sobbed out piteously,  \n"Ah, love!" and stopped heart-broken; then, "O Love!  \nAlas the green dear home that I must leave  \nSo early! I was so glad of love and kisses,  \nAnd thought that centuries would not exhaust  \nThe deep embrace. And I have had so little  \nOf joy and the wild day and throbbing night,  \nLaughter, and tenderness, and strife and tears.  \nI have not numbered half the brilliant birds  \nIn one green forest, nor am familiar grown  \nWith sunrise and the progress of the eves,  \nNor have with plaintive cries of birds made friends,  \nCuckoo and rainlark and love-speak-to-me.  \nI have not learned the names of half the flowers  \nAround me; so few trees know me by my name;  \nNor have I seen the stars so very often  \nThat I should die. I feel a dreadful hand  \nDrawing me from the touch of thy warm limbs  \nInto some cold vague mist, and all black night  \nDescends towards me. I no more am thine,  \nBut go I know not where, and see pale shapes  \nAnd gloomy countries and that terrible stream.  \nO Love, O Love, they take me from thee far,  \nAnd whether we shall find each other ever  \nIn the wide dreadful territory of death,  \nI know not. Or thou wilt forget me quite,  \nAnd life compel thee into other arms.  \nAh, come with me! I cannot bear to wander  \nIn that cold cruel country all alone,  \nHelpless and terrified, or sob by streams  \nDenied sweet sunlight and by thee unloved."  \nSlower her voice came now, and over her cheek  \nDeath paused; then, sobbing like a little child  \nToo early from her bounding pleasures called,  \nThe lovely discontented spirit stole  \nFrom her warm body white. Over her leaned  \nRuru, and waited for dead lips to move. p. 6  \nStill in the greenwood lay Priyumvada,  \nAnd Ruru rose not from her, but with eyes  \nEmptied of glory hung above his dead,  \nOnly, without a word, without a tear.  \nThen the crowned wives of the great forest came,  \nThey who had fed her from maternal breasts,  \nAnd grieved over the lovely body cold,  \nAnd bore it from him; nor did he entreat  \nOne last look nor one kiss, nor yet denied  \nWhat he had loved so well. They the dead girl  \nInto some distant greenness bore away.\n\nBut Ruru, while the stillness of the place  \nRemembered her, sat without voice. He heard  \nThrough the great silence that was now his soul,  \nThe forest sounds, a squirrel\'s leap through leaves,  \nThe cheeping of a bird just overhead,  \nA peacock with his melancholy cry  \nComplaining far away, and tossings dim  \nAnd slight unnoticeable stir of trees.  \nBut all these were to him like distant things  \nAnd he alone in his heart\'s void. And yet  \nNo thought he had of her so lately lost,  \nRather far pictures, trivial incidents  \nOf that old life before her delicate face  \nHad lived for him, dumbly distinct like thoughts  \nOf men that die, kept with long pomps his mind  \nExcluding the dead girl. So still he was,  \nThe birds flashed by him with their swift small wings,  \nFanning him. Then he moved, then rigorous  \nMemory through all his body shuddering  \nAwoke, and he looked up and knew the place,  \nAnd recognised greenness immutable,  \nAnd saw old trees and the same flowers still bloom.  \nHe felt the bright indifference of earth  \nAnd all the lonely uselessness of pain.  \nThen lifting up the beauty of his brow  \nHe spoke, with sorrow pale: "O grim cold Death!  \nBut I will not like ordinary men  \nSatiate thee with cries, and falsely woo thee, p. 7  \nAnd make my grief thy theatre, who lie  \nProstrate beneath thy thunderbolts and make  \nNight witness of their moans, shuddering and crying  \nWhen sudden memories pierce them like swords,  \nAnd often starting up as at a thought  \nIntolerable, pace a little, then  \nSink down exhausted by brief agony.  \nO secrecy terrific, darkness vast,  \nAt which we shudder! Somewhere, I know not where,  \nSomehow, I know not how, I shall confront  \nThy gloom, tremendous spirit, and seize with hands  \nAnd prove what thou art and what man." He said,  \nAnd slowly to the forests wandered. There  \nLong months he travelled between grief and grief,  \nReliving thoughts of her with every pace,  \nMeasuring vast pain in his immortal mind.  \nAnd his heart cried in him as when a fire  \nRoars through wide forests and the branches cry  \nBurning towards heaven in torture glorious.  \nSo burned, immense, his grief within him; he raised  \nHis young pure face all solemnised with pain,  \nVoiceless. Then Fate was shaken, and the Gods  \nGrieved for him, of his silence grown afraid.  \nTherefore from peaks divine came flashing down  \nImmortal Agni and to the Uswuttha-tree  \nCried in the Voice that slays the world: "O tree  \nThat liftest thy enormous branches able  \nTo shelter armies, more than armies now  \nShelter, be famous, house a brilliant God.  \nFor the grief grows in Ruru\'s breast up-piled,  \nAs wrestles with its anguished barricades  \nIn silence an impending flood, and Gods  \nImmortal grow afraid. For earth alarmed  \nShudders to bear the curse lest her young life  \nPale with eclipse and all-creating love  \nBe to mere pain condemned. Divert the wrath  \nInto thy boughs, Uswuttha--thou shalt be  \nMy throne--glorious, though in eternal pain,  \nYet worth much pain to harbour divine fire."  \nSo ended the young pure destroyer\'s voice, p. 8  \nAnd the dumb god consented silently.  \nIn the same noon came Ruru; his mind had paused,  \nLured for a moment by soft wandering gleams  \nInto forgetfulness of pain; for thoughts  \nGentle and near-eyed whispering memories  \nSo sweetly came, his blind heart dreamed she lived.  \nSlow the Uswuttha-tree bent down its leaves,  \nAnd smote his cheek, and touched his heavy hair.  \nAnd Ruru turned illumined. For a moment,  \nOne blissful moment he had felt \'twas she.  \nSo had she often stolen up and touched  \nHis curls with her enamoured fingers small,  \nLingering, while the wind smote him with her hair  \nAnd her quick breath came to him like spring. Then he,  \nTurning, as one surprised with heaven, saw  \nReady to his swift passionate grasp her bosom  \nAnd body sweet expecting his embrace.  \nOh, now saw her not, but the guilty tree  \nShrinking; then grief back with a double crown  \nArose and stained his face with agony.  \nNor silence he endured, but the dumb force  \nAscetic and inherited, by sires  \nFierce-musing earned, from the boy\'s bosom blazed.  \n"O Uswuttha-tree, wantonly who hast mocked  \nMy anguish with the wind, but thou no more  \nHave joy of the cool wind nor green delight,  \nBut live thy guilty leaves in fire, so long  \nAs Aryan wheels by thy doomed shadow vast  \nThunder to war, nor bless with cool wide waves  \nLyric Saruswathi nations impure."  \nHe spoke, and the vast tree groaned through its leaves,  \nRecognising its fate; then smouldered; lines  \nOf living fire rushed up the girth and hissed  \nSerpentine in the unconsuming leaves;  \nLast, all Hutashan in his chariot armed  \nSprang on the boughs and blazed into the sky,  \nAnd wailing all the great tormented creature  \nStood wide in agony; one half was green  \nAnd earthly, the other a weird brilliance  \nFilled with the speed and cry of endless flame. p. 9  \nBut he, with the fierce rushing-out of power  \nShaken and that strong grasp of anguish, flung  \nHis hands out to the sun; "Priyumvada!"  \nHe cried, and at that well-loved sound there dawned  \nWith overwhelming sweetness miserable  \nUpon his mind the old delightful times  \nWhen he had called her by her liquid name,  \nWhere the voice loved to linger. He remembered  \nThe chompuc bushes where she turned away  \nHalf-angered, and his speaking of her name  \nMasterfully as to a lovely slave  \nRebellious who has erred; at that the slow  \nYielding of her small head, and after a little  \nHer sliding towards him and beautiful  \nPropitiating body as she sank down  \nWith timid graspings deprecatingly  \nIn prostrate warm surrender, her flushed cheeks  \nUpon his feet and little touches soft;  \nOr her long name uttered beseechingly,  \nAnd the swift leap of all her body to him,  \nAnd eyes of large repentance, and the weight  \nOf her wild bosom and lips unsatisfied;  \nOr hourly call for little trivial needs,  \nOr sweet unneeded wanton summoning,  \nDaily appeal that never staled nor lost  \nIts sudden music, and her lovely speed,  \nSedulous occupation left, quick-breathing,  \nWith great glad eyes and eager parted lips;  \nOr in deep quiet moments murmuring  \nThat name like a religion in her ear,  \nAnd her calm look compelled to ecstasy;  \nOr to the river luring her, or breathed  \nOver her dainty slumber, or secret sweet  \nBridal outpantings of her broken name.  \nAll these as rush unintermitting waves  \nUpon a swimmer overborne, broke on him  \nRelentless, things too happy to be endured,  \nTill faint with the recalled felicity  \nLow he moaned out: "O pale Priyumvada!  \nO dead fair flower! yet living to my grief! p. 10  \nBut I could only slay the innocent tree,  \nPowerless when power should have been. Not such  \nWas Bhrigu from whose sacred strength I spring,  \nNor Bhrigu\'s son, my father, when he blazed  \nOut from Puloma\'s side, and burning, blind,  \nFell like a tree the ravisher unjust.  \nBut I degenerate from such sires. O Death  \nThat showest not thy face beneath the stars,  \nBut comest masked, and on our dear ones seizing  \nFearest to wrestle equally with love!  \nNor from thy gloomy house any come back  \nTo tell thy way. But O, if any strength  \nIn lover\'s constancy to torture dwell  \nEarthward to force a helping god and such  \nAscetic force be born of lover\'s pain,  \nLet my dumb pangs be heard. Whoe\'er thou art,  \nO thou bright enemy of Death descend  \nAnd lead me to that portal dim. For I  \nHave burned in fires cruel as the fire  \nAnd lain upon a sharper couch than swords."  \nHe ceased, and heaven thrilled, and the far blue  \nQuivered as with invisible downward wings.\n\nBut Ruru passioned on, and came with eve  \nTo secret grass and a green opening moist  \nIn a cool lustre. Leaned upon a tree  \nThat bathed in faery air and saw the sky  \nThrough branches, and a single parrot loud  \nScreamed from its top, there stood a golden boy,  \nHalf-naked, with bright limbs all beautiful--  \nDelicate they were, in sweetness absolute:  \nFor every gleam and every soft strong curve  \nMagically compelled the eye, and smote  \nThe heart to weakness. In his hands he swung  \nA bow--not such as human archers use:  \nFor the string moved and murmured like many bees,  \nAnd nameless fragrance made the casual air  \nA peril. He on Ruru that fair face  \nTurned, and his steps with lovely gesture chained.  \n"Who art thou here, in forests wandering,p. 11  \nAnd thy young exquisite face is solemnised  \nWith pain? Luxuriously the Gods have tortured  \nThy heart to see such dreadful glorious beauty  \nAgonize in thy lips and brilliant eyes:  \nAs tyrants in the fierceness of others\' pangs  \nJoy and feel strong, clothing with brilliant fire,  \nTyrants in Titan lands. Needs must her mouth  \nHave been pure honey and her bosom a charm,  \nWhom thou desirest seeing not the green  \nAnd common lovely sounds hast quite forgot."  \nAnd Ruru, mastered by the God, replied:  \n"I know thee by thy cruel beauty bright,  \nKama, who makest many worlds one fire.  \nAh, wherefore wilt thou ask of her to increase  \nThe passion and regret? Thou knowest, great love!  \nThy nymph her mother, if thou truly art he  \nAnd not a dream of my disastrous soul."  \nBut with the thrilled eternal smile that makes  \nThe spring, the lover of Rathi golden-limbed  \nReplied to Ruru, "Mortal, I am he;  \nI am that Madan who inform the stars  \nWith lustre and on life\'s wide canvas fill  \nPictures of light and shade, of joy and tears,  \nMake ordinary moments wonderful  \nAnd common speech a charm: knit life to life  \nWith interfusions of opposing souls  \nAnd sudden meetings and slow sorceries:  \nWing the boy bridegroom to that panting breast,  \nSmite Gods with mortal faces, dreadfully  \nAmong great beautiful kings and watched by eyes  \nThat burn, force on the virgin\'s fainting limbs  \nAnd drive her to the one face never seen,  \nThe one breast meant eternally for her.  \nBy me come wedded sweets, by me the wife\'s  \nBusy delight and passionate obedience,  \nAnd loving eager service never sated,  \nAnd happy lips, and worshipping soft eyes:  \nAnd mine the husband\'s hungry arms and use  \nUnwearying of old tender words and ways,  \nJoy of her hair, and silent pleasure felt p. 12  \nOf nearness to one dear familiar shape.  \nNor only these, but many affections bright  \nAnd soft glad things cluster around my name.  \nI plant fraternal tender yearnings, make  \nThe sister\'s sweet attractiveness and leap  \nOf heart towards imperious kindred blood,  \nAnd the young mother\'s passionate deep look,  \nEarth\'s high similitude of One not earth,  \nTeach filial heart-beats strong. These are my gifts  \nFor which men praise me, these my glories calm:  \nBut fiercer shafts I can, wild storms blown down  \nShaking fixed minds and melting marble natures,  \nTears and dumb bitterness and pain unpitied,  \nRacked thirsting jealousy and kind hearts made stone:  \nAnd in undisciplined huge souls I sow  \nDire vengeance and impossible cruelties,  \nCold lusts that linger and fierce fickleness,  \nThe loves close kin to hate, brute violence  \nAnd mad insatiable longings pale,  \nAnd passion blind as death and deaf as swords.  \nO mortal, all deep-souled desires and all  \nYearnings immense are mine, so much I can."  \nSo as he spoke, his face grew wonderful  \nWith vast suggestion, his human-seeming limbs  \nBrightened with a soft splendour: luminous hints  \nOf the concealed divinity transpired.  \nBut soon with a slight discontented frown:  \n"So much I can, as even the great Gods learn.  \nOnly with death I wrestle in vain, until  \nMy passionate godhead all becomes a doubt.  \nMortal, I am the light in stars, of flowers  \nThe bloom, the nameless fragrance that pervades  \nCreation: but behind me, older than me,  \nHe comes with night and cold tremendous shade.  \nHard is the way to him, most hard to find,  \nHarder to tread, for perishable feet  \nAlmost impossible. Yet, O fair youth,  \nIf thou must needs go down, and thou art strong  \nIn passion and in constancy, nor easy  \nThe soul to slay that has survived such grief p. 13  \nSteel then thyself to venture, armed by Love.  \nYet listen first what heavy trade they drive  \nWho would win back their dead to human arms."  \nSo much the God; but swift, with eager eyes  \nAnd panting bosom and glorious flushed face,  \nThe lover: "O great Love! O beautiful Love!  \nBut if by strength is possible, of body  \nOr mind, battle or spirit or moving speech,  \nSweet speech that makes even cruelty grow kind,  \nOr yearning melody--for I have heard  \nThat when Saruswathi in heaven her harp  \nHas smitten, the cruel sweetness terrible  \nCoils taking no denial through the soul,  \nAnd tears burst from the hearts of Gods--then I,  \nMaking great music, or with perfect words,  \nWill strive, or staying him with desperate hands  \nMatch human strength \'gainst formidable Death.  \nBut if with price, ah God! what easier! Tears  \nDreadful, innumerable I will absolve,  \nOr pay with anguish through the centuries,  \nSoul\'s agony and torture physical,  \nSo her small hands about my face at last  \nI feel, close real hair sting me with life,  \nAnd palpable breathing bosom on me press."  \nThen with a lenient smile the mighty God:  \n"O ignorant fond lover, not with tears  \nShalt thou persuade immitigable Death.  \nHe will not pity all thy pangs: nor know  \nHis stony eyes with music to grow kind,  \nNor lovely words accepts. And how wilt thou  \nWrestle with that grim shadow, who canst not save  \nOne bloom from fading? A sole thing the Gods  \nDemand from all men living, sacrifice:  \nNor without this shall any crown be grasped.  \nYet many sacrifices are there, oxen,  \nAnd prayers, and Soma wine, and pious flowers,  \nBlood and the fierce expense of mind, and pure  \nIncense of perfect actions, perfect thoughts,  \nOr liberality wide as the sun\'s,  \nOr ruthless labour or disastrous tears,p. 14  \nExile or death or pain more hard than death,  \nAbsence, a desert, from the faces loved;  \nEven sin may be a sumptuous sacrifice  \nAcceptable for unholy fruits. But none  \nOf these the inexorable shadow asks:  \nAlone of gods Death loves not gifts: he visits  \nThe pure heart as the stained. Lo, the just man  \nBowed helpless over his dead, nor all his virtues  \nShall quicken that cold bosom: near him the wild  \nMarred face and passionate and will not leave  \nKissing dead lips that shall not chide him more.  \nLife the pale ghost requires: with half thy life  \nThou mayst protract the thread too early cut  \nOf that delightful spirit--half sweet life.  \nO Ruru, lo, thy frail precarious days,  \nAnd yet how sweet they are! simply to breathe  \nHow warm and sweet! And ordinary things  \nHow exquisite, thou then shalt learn when lost,  \nHow luminous the daylight was, mere sleep  \nHow soft and friendly clasping tired limbs,  \nAnd the deliciousness of common food.  \nAnd things indifferent thou then shalt want,  \nRegret rejected beauty, brightnesses  \nBestowed in vain. Wilt thou yield up, O lover,  \nHalf thy sweet portion of this light and gladness,  \nThy little insufficient share, and vainly  \nGive to another? She is not thyself:  \nThou dost not feel the gladness in her bosom,  \nNor with the torture of thy body will she  \nThrob and cry out: at most with tender looks  \nAnd pitiful attempt to feel move near thee,  \nAnd weep how far she is from what she loves.  \nMen live like stars that see each other in heaven,  \nBut one knows not the pleasure and the grief  \nThe others feel: he lonely rapture has,  \nOr bears his incommunicable pain.  \nO Ruru, there are many beautiful faces,  \nBut one thyself. Think then how thou shalt mourn  \nWhen thou hast shortened joy and feelst at last  \nThe shadow that thou hadst for such sweet store." p. 15  \nHe ceased with a strange doubtful look. But swift  \nCame back the lover\'s voice, like passionate rain.  \n"O idle words! For what is mere sunlight?  \nWho would live on into extreme old age,  \nBurden the impatient world, a weary old man,  \nAnd look back on a selfish time ill-spent  \nExacting out of prodigal great life  \nSmall separate pleasures like an usurer,  \nAnd no rich sacrifice and no large act  \nFinding oneself in others, nor the sweet  \nExpense of Nature in her passionate gusts  \nOf love and giving, first of the soul\'s needs?  \nWho is so coldly wise, and does not feel  \nHow wasted were our grandiose human days  \nIn prudent personal unshared delights?  \nWhy dost thou mock me, friend of all the stars?  \nHow canst thou be love\'s god and know not this,  \nThat love burns down the body\'s barriers cold  \nAnd laughs at difference--playing with it merely  \nTo make joy sweeter? O too deeply I know,  \nThe lover is not different from the loved,  \nNor is their silence dumb to each other. He  \nContains her heart and feels her body in his,  \nHe flushes with her heat, chills with her cold.  \nAnd when she dies, oh! when she dies, oh me,  \nThe emptiness, the maim! the life no life,  \nThe sweet and passionate oneness lost! And if  \nBy shortening of great grief won back, O price  \nEasy! O glad briefness, aeons may envy!  \nFor we shall live not fearing death, nor feel  \nAs others yearning over the loved at night  \nWhen the lamp flickers, sudden chills of dread  \nTerrible; nor at short absence agonise,  \nWrestling with mad imagination. Us  \nSerenely when the darkening shadow comes,  \nOne common sob shall end and soul clasp soul,  \nLeaving the body in a long dim kiss.  \nThen in the joys of heaven we shall consort,  \nAmid the gladness often touching hands  \nTo make bliss sure; or in the ghastly stream p. 16  \nIf we must anguish, yet it shall not part  \nOur passionate limbs inextricably locked  \nBy one strong agony, but we shall feel  \nHell\'s pain half joy through sweet companionship.  \nGod Love, I weary of words. O wing me rather  \nTo her, my eloquent princess of the spring,  \nIn whatsoever wintry shores she roam."  \nHe ceased with eager forward eyes; once more  \nA light of beauty immortal through the limbs  \nGleaming of the boy-god and soft sweet face,  \nGlorifying him, flushed, and he replied:  \n"Go then, O thou dear youth, and bear this flower  \nIn thy hand warily. For thou shalt come  \nTo that high meeting of the Ganges pure  \nWith vague and violent Ocean. There arise  \nAnd loudly appeal my brother, the wild sea."  \nHe spoke and stretched out his immortal hand,  \nAnd Ruru\'s met it. All his young limbs yearned  \nWith dreadful rapture shuddering through them. He  \nFelt in his fingers subtle uncertain bloom,  \nA quivering magnificence, half fire,  \nWhose petals changed like flame, and from them breathed  \nDangerous attraction and alarmed delight,  \nAs at a peril near. He raised his eyes,  \nBut the green place was empty of the God.  \nOnly the faery tree looked up at heaven  \nThrough branches, and with recent pleasure shook.  \nThen over fading earth the night was lord.\n\nBut from Shatudru and Bipasha, streams  \nOnce holy, and loved Iravathi and swift  \nClear Chandrabhaga and Bitosta\'s toil  \nFor man, went Ruru to bright sumptuous lands  \nBy Aryan fathers not yet paced, but wild,  \nBut virgin to our fruitful human toil,  \nWhere nature lay reclined in dumb delight  \nAlone with woodlands and the voiceless hills.  \nHe with the widening yellow Ganges came,  \nAmazed, to trackless countries where few tribes,  \nKirath and Poundrian, warred, worshipping trees p. 17  \nAnd the great serpent. But robust wild earth,  \nBut forests with their splendid life of beasts  \nSavage mastered those strong inhabitants.  \nThither came Ruru. In a thin soft eve  \nGanges spread far her multitudinous waves,  \nA glimmering restlessness with voices large,  \nAnd from the forests of that half-seen bank  \nA boat came heaving over it, white-winged,  \nWith a sole silent helmsman marble-pale.  \nThen Ruru by his side stepped in; they went  \nDown the mysterious river and beheld  \nThe great banks widen out of sight. The world  \nWas water and the skies to water plunged.  \nAll night with a dim motion gliding down  \nHe felt the dark against his eyelids; felt,  \nAs in a dream more real than daylight,  \nThe helmsman with his dumb and marble face  \nNear him and moving wideness all around,  \nAnd that continual gliding dimly on,  \nAs one who on a shoreless water sails  \nFor ever to a port he shall not win.  \nBut when the darkness paled, he heard a moan  \nOf mightier waves and had the wide great sense  \nOf ocean and the depths below our feet.  \nBut the boat stopped; the pilot lifted on him  \nHis marble gaze cheval with the stars.  \nThen in the white-winged boat the boy arose  \nAnd saw around him the vast sea all grey  \nAnd heaving in the pallid dawning light.  \nLoud Ruru cried across the murmur: "Hear me,  \nO inarticulate grey Ocean, hear.  \nIf any cadence in thy infinite  \nRumour was caught from lover\'s moan, O Sea,  \nOpen thy abysses to my mortal tread.  \nFor I would travel to the despairing shades,  \nThe spheres of suffering where entangled dwell  \nSouls unreleased and the untimely dead  \nWho weep remembering. Thither, O guide me,  \nNo despicable wayfarer, but Ruru,  \nBut son of a great Rishi, from all men p. 18  \nOn earth selected for peculiar pangs,  \nSpecial disaster. Lo, this petalled fire,  \nHow freshly it blooms and lasts with my great pain!"  \nHe held the flower out subtly glimmering.  \nAnd like a living thing the huge sea trembled,  \nThen rose, calling, and filled the sight with eaves,  \nConverging all its giant crests; towards him  \nInnumerable waters loomed and heaven  \nThreatened. Horizon on horizon moved  \nDreadfully swift; then with a prone wide sound  \nAll Ocean hollowing drew him swiftly in,  \nCurving with monstrous menace over him.  \nHe down the gulf where the loud waves collapsed  \nDescending, saw with floating hair arise  \nThe daughters of the sea in pale green light,  \nA million mystic breasts suddenly bare,  \nAnd came beneath the flood and stunned beheld  \nA mute stupendous march of waters race  \nTo reach some viewless pit beneath the world.  \nGanges he saw, as men predestined rush  \nUpon a fearful doom foreseen, so ran,  \nAlarmed, with anguished speed, the river vast.  \nVeiled to his eyes the triple goddess rose.  \nShe with a sound of water cried to him,  \nA thousand voices moaning with one pain:  \n"Lover, who fearedst not sunlight to leave,  \nWith me thou mayst behold that helpless spirit  \nLost in the gloom, if still thy burning bosom  \nHave courage to endure great Nature\'s night  \nIn the dire lands where I, a goddess, mourn  \nHurting my heart with my own cruelty."  \nShe darkened to the ominous descent,  \nUnwilling, and her once so human waves  \nSent forth a cry not meant for living ears.  \nAnd Ruru chilled; but terrible strong love  \nWas like a fiery finger in his breast  \nPointing him on; so he through horror went  \nConducted by inexorable sound.  \nFor monstrous voices to his ear were close,  \nAnd bodiless terrors with their dimness seized him p. 19  \nIn an obscurity phantasmal. Thus  \nWith agony of soul to the grey waste  \nHe came, glad of the pain of passage over,  \nAs men who through the storms of anguish strive  \nInto abiding tranquil dreariness  \nAnd draw sad breath assured; to the grey waste,  \nHopeless Patal, the immutable  \nCountry, where neither sun nor rain arrives,  \nNor happy labour of the human plough  \nFruitfully turns the soil, but in vague sands  \nAnd indeterminable strange rocks and caverns  \nThat into silent blackness huge recede,  \nDwell the great serpent and his hosts, writhed forms,  \nSinuous, abhorred, through many horrible leagues  \nCoiling in a half darkness. Shapes he saw,  \nAnd heard the hiss and knew the lambent light  \nLoathsome, but passed compelling his strong soul.  \nAt last through those six tired hopeless worlds,  \nToo hopeless far for grief, pale he arrived  \nInto a nether air by anguish moved,  \nAnd heard before him cries that pierced the heart,  \nHuman, not to be borne, and issued shaken  \nBy the great river accursed. Maddened it ran,  \nAnguished, importunate, and in its waves  \nThe drifting ghosts their agony endured.  \nThere Ruru saw pale faces float of kings  \nAnd grandiose victors and revered high priests  \nAnd famous women. Now rose from the wave  \nA golden shuddering arm and now a face.  \nTorn piteous sides were seen and breasts that quailed.  \nOver them moaned the penal waters on,  \nAnd had no joy of their fierce cruelty.  \nThen Ruru, his young cheeks with pity wan,  \nHalf moaned: "O miserable race of men,  \nWith violent and passionate souls you come  \nForedoomed upon the earth and live brief days  \nIn fear and anguish, catching at stray beams  \nOf sunlight, little fragrances of flowers,  \nThen from your spacious earth in a great horror  \nDescend into this night, and here too soon p. 20  \nMust expiate your few inadequate joys.  \nO bargain hard! Death helps us not. He leads  \nAlarmed, all shivering from his chill embrace,  \nThe naked spirit here. Oh my sweet flower,  \nArt thou too whelmed in this fierce wailing flood?  \nAh me! But I will haste and deeply plunge  \nInto its hopeless pools and either bring  \nThy old warm beauty back beneath the stars,  \nOr find thee out and clasp thy tortured bosom  \nAnd kiss thy sweet wrung lips and hush thy cries.  \nLove shall draw half thy pain into my limbs;  \nThen we shall triumph glad of agony."  \nHe ceased and one replied close by his ear:  \n"O thou who troublest with thy living eyes  \nEstablished death, pass on. She whom thou seekest  \nRolls not in the accursed tide. For late  \nI saw her mid those pale inhabitants  \nWhom bodily anguish visits not, but thoughts  \nSorrowful and dumb memories absolve,  \nAnd martyrdom of scourged hearts quivering."  \nHe turned and saw astride the dolorous flood  \nA mighty bridge paved with mosaic fire,  \nAll restless, and a woman clothed in flame,  \nWith hands calamitous that held a sword,  \nStood of the quaking passage sentinel.  \nMagnificent and dire her burning face.  \n"Pass on," she said once more, "O Bhrigu\'s son;  \nThe flower protects thee from my hands." She stretched  \nOne arm towards him and with violence  \nMajestic over the horrid arch compelled.  \nUnhurt, though shaking from her touch, alone  \nHe stood upon an inner bank with strange  \nBlack dreary mosses covered and perceived  \nA dim and level plain without one flower.  \nOver it paced a multitude immense  \nWith gentle faces occupied by pain;  \nStrong men were there and grieving mothers, girls  \nWith early beauty in their limbs and young  \nSad children of their childlike faces robbed.  \nNaked they paced with falling hair and gaze p. 21  \nDrooping upon their bosoms, weak as flowers  \nThat die for want of rain unmurmuring.  \nAlways a silence was upon the place.  \nBut Ruru came among them. Suddenly  \nOne felt him there and looked, then as a wind  \nMoves over a still field of patient corn,  \nAnd the ears stir and shudder and look up  \nAnd bend innumerably flowing, so  \nAll those dumb spirits stirred and through them passed  \nOne shuddering motion of raised faces; then  \nThey streamed towards him without sound and caught  \nWith desperate hands his robe or touched his hair  \nOr strove to feel upon them living breath.  \nPale girls and quiet children came and knelt  \nAnd with large sorrowful eyes into his looked.  \nYet with their silent passion the cold hush  \nMoved not; but Ruru\'s human heart half burst  \nWith burden of so many sorrows; tears  \nWelled from him; he with anguish understood  \nThat terrible and wordless sympathy  \nOf dead souls for the living. Then he turned  \nHis eyes and scanned their lovely faces strange  \nFor that one face and found it not. He paled,  \nAnd spoke vain words into the listless air:  \n"O spirits once joyous, miserable race,  \nHappier if the old gladness were forgot!  \nMy soul yearns with your sorrow. Yet ah! reveal  \nIf dwell my love in your sad nation lost.  \nWell may you know her, O wan beautiful spirits!  \nBut she most beautiful of all that died,  \nBy sweetness recognisable. Her name  \nThe sunshine knew." Speaking his tears made way:  \nBut they with dumb lips only looked at him,  \nA vague and empty mourning in their eyes.  \nHe murmured low: "Ah, folly! were she here,  \nWould she not first have felt me, first have raised  \nHer lids and run to me, leaned back her face  \nOf silent sorrow on my breast and looked  \nWith the old altered eyes into my own  \nAnd striven to make my anguish understand? p. 22  \nOh joy, had she been here! for though her lips  \nOf their old excellent music quite were robbed,  \nYet her dumb passion would have spoken to me;  \nWe should have understood each other and walked  \nSilently hand in hand, almost content."  \nHe said and passed through those untimely dead.  \nSpeechless they followed him with clinging eyes.  \nThen to a solemn building weird he came  \nWith grave colossal pillars round. One dome  \nRoofed the whole brooding edifice, like cloud,  \nAnd at the door strange shapes were pacing, armed.  \nThen from their fear the sweet and mournful dead  \nDrew back, returning to their wordless grief.  \nBut Ruru to the perilous doorway strode,  \nAnd those disastrous shapes upon him raised  \nTheir bows and aimed; but he held out Love\'s flower,  \nAnd with stern faces checked they let him pass.  \nHe entered and beheld a silent hall  \nDim and unbounded; moving then like one  \nWho up a dismal stair seeks ever light,  \nAttained a dais brilliant doubtfully  \nWith flaming pediment and round it coiled  \nPython and Naga monstrous, Joruthcaru,  \nTuxuc and Vasuki himself, immense,  \nMagic Carcotaca all flecked with fire;  \nAnd many other prone destroying shapes  \nCoiled. On the wondrous dais rose a throne,  \nAnd he its pedestal whose lotus hood  \nWith ominous beauty crowns his horrible  \nSleek folds, great Mahapudma; high displayed  \nHe bears the throne of Death. There sat supreme  \nWith those compassionate and lethal eyes,  \nWho many names, who many natures holds;  \nYama, the strong pure Hades sad and subtle,  \nDharma, who keeps the laws of old untouched,  \nCritanta, who ends all things and at last  \nHimself shall end. On either side of him  \nThe four-eyed dogs mysterious rested prone,  \nWatchful, with huge heads on their paws advanced;  \nAnd emanations of the godhead dim p. 23  \nMoved near him, shadowy or serpentine,  \nVast Time and cold irreparable Death.  \nThen Ruru came and bowed before the throne;  \nAnd swaying all those figures stirred as shapes  \nUpon a tapestry moved by the wind,  \nAnd the sad voice was heard: "What breathing man  \nBows at the throne of Hades? By what force,  \nSpiritual or communicated, troubles  \nHis living beauty the dead grace of Hell?"  \nAnd one replied who seemed a neighbouring voice:  \n"He has the blood of Gods and Titans old.  \nAn Apsara his mother liquid-orbed  \nBore to the youthful Chyavan\'s strong embrace  \nThis passionate face of earth with Eden touched.  \nChyavan was Bhrigu\'s child, Puloma bore,  \nThe Titaness,--Bhrigu, great Brahma\'s son.  \nLove gave the flower that helps by anguish; therefore  \nHe chilled not with the breath of Hades, nor  \nThe cry of the infernal stream made stone."  \nBut at the name of Love all hell was moved.  \nDeath\'s throne half faded into twilight; hissed  \nThe phantoms serpentine as if in pain,  \nAnd the dogs raised their dreadful heads. Then spoke  \nYama: "And what needs Love in this pale realm,  \nThe warm great Love? All worlds his breath confounds,  \nMars solemn order and old steadfastness.  \nBut not in hell his legates come and go;  \nHis vernal jurisdiction to bare Hell  \nExtends not. This last world resists his power  \nYouthful, anarchic. Here will he enlarge  \nTumult and wanton joys?" The voice replied:  \n"Menaca momentary on the earth,  \nHeaven\'s Apsara by the fleeting hours beguiled  \nPlayed in the happy hidden glens; there bowed  \nTo yoke of swift terrestrial joys she bore,  \nImmortal, to that fair Gundhurva king  \nA mortal blossom of delight. That bloom  \nYoung Ruru found and plucked, but her too soon  \nThy fatal hooded snake on earth surprised,  \nAnd he through gloom now travels armed by Love." p. 24  \nBut then all Hades swaying towards him cried:  \n"O mortal, O misled! But sacrifice  \nIs stronger, nor may law of Hell or Heaven  \nIts fierce effectual action supersede.  \nThy dead I yield. Yet thou bethink thee, mortal,  \nNot as a tedious evil nor to be  \nLightly rejected gave the gods old age,  \nBut tranquil, but august, but making easy  \nThe steep ascent to God. Therefore must Time  \nStill batter down the glory and form of youth  \nAnd animal magnificent strong ease,  \nTo warn the earthward man that he is spirit  \nDallying with transience, nor by death he ends,  \nNor to the dumb warm mother\'s arms is bound,  \nBut called unborn into the unborn skies.  \nFor body fades with the increasing soul  \nAnd wideness of its limit grown intolerant  \nReplaces life\'s impetuous joys by peace.  \nYouth, manhood, ripeness, age, four seasons  \nTwixt its return and pale departing life  \nDescribes, O mortal,--youth that forward bends  \nMidst hopes, delights and dreamings; manhood deepens  \nTo passions, toils and thoughts profound; but ripeness  \nFor large reflective gathering-up of these,  \nAs on a lonely slope whence men look back  \nDown towards the cities and the human fields  \nWhere they too worked and laughed and loved; next age,  \nWonderful age with those approaching skies.  \nThat boon wilt thou renounce? Wherefore? To bring  \nFor a few years--how miserably few!--  \nHer sunward who must after all return.  \nAh, son of Rishis, cease, Lo, I remit  \nHell\'s grasp, not oft-relinquished, and send back  \nThy beautiful life unborrowed to the stars.  \nOr thou must render to the immutable  \nTotal all thy fruit-bearing years; then she  \nReblossoms." But the Shadow antagonist:  \n"Let him be shown the glory he would renounce."  \nAnd over the flaming pediment there moved,  \nAs on a frieze a march of sculptures, carved p. 25  \nBy Phidias for the Virgin strong and pure,  \nMost perfect once of all things seen in earth  \nOr Heaven, in Athens on the Acropolis,  \nBut now dismembered, now disrupt! or as  \nIn Buddhist cavern or Orissan temple,  \nLarge aspirations architectural,  \nWarrior and dancing-girl, adept and king,  \nAnd conquering pomps and daily peaceful groups  \nDream delicately on, softening with beauty  \nGreat Bhuvanayshwar, the Almighty\'s house,  \nWith sculptural suggestion so were limned  \nScenes future on a pediment of fire.  \nThere Ruru saw himself divine with age,  \nA Rishi to whom infinity is close,  \nRejoicing in some green song-haunted glade  \nOr boundless mountain-top where most we feel  \nWideness, not by small happy things disturbed.  \nAround him, as around an ancient tree  \nIts seedlings, forms august or flame-like rose;  \nThey grew beneath his hands and were his work;  \nGreat kings were there whom time remembers, fertile  \nDeep minds and poets with their chanting lips  \nWhose words were seed of vast philosophies  \nThese worshipped; above this earth\'s half-day he saw  \nAmazed the dawn of that mysterious Face  \nAnd all the universe in beauty merge.  \nMad the boy thrilled upwards, then spent ebbed back.  \nOver his mind, as birds across the sky  \nSweep and are gone, the vision of those fields  \nAnd drooping faces came; almost he heard  \nThe burdened river with human anguish wail.  \nThen with a sudden fury gathering  \nHis soul he hurled out of it half its life,  \nAnd fell, like lightning, prone. Triumphant rose  \nThe Shadow chill and deepened giant night.  \nOnly the dais flickered in the gloom,  \nAnd those snake-eyes of cruel fire subdued.  \nBut suddenly a bloom, a fragrance. Hell  \nShuddered with bliss: resentful, overborne,  \nThe world-besetting Terror faded back p. 26  \nLike one grown weak by desperate victory,  \nAnd a voice cried in Ruru\'s tired soul:  \n"Arise! the strife is over, easy now  \nThe horror that thou hast to face, the burden  \nNow shared." And with a sudden burst like spring  \nLife woke in the strong lover over-tired.  \nHe rose and left dim Death. Twelve times he crossed  \nBoithorini, the river dolorous,  \nTwelve times resisted Hell and hurried down  \nInto the ominous pit where plunges black  \nThe vast stream thundering, saw, led puissantly  \nFrom night to unimaginable night,  \nAs men oppressed in dreams, who cannot wake,  \nBut measure penal visions,--punishments  \nWhose sight pollutes, unheard-of tortures, pangs  \nMonstrous, intolerable mute agonies,  \nTwisted unmoving attitudes of pain,  \nLike thoughts inhuman in statuary. A fierce  \nAnd iron voicelessness had grasped those worlds.  \nNo horror of cries expressed their endless pain,  \nNo saving struggle, no breathings of the soul.  \nAnd in the last hell irremediable  \nWhere Ganges clots into that fatal pool,  \nAppalled he saw her; pallid, listless, bare--  \nO other than that earthly warmth and grace  \nIn which the happy roses deepened and dimmed  \nWith come-and-go of swift enamoured blood!  \nDumb drooped she; round her shapes of anger armed  \nStood dark like thunder-clouds. But Ruru sprang  \nUpon them, burning with the admitted God.  \nThey from his touch like ineffectual fears  \nVanished; then sole with her, trembling he cried  \nThe old glad name and crying bent to her  \nAnd touched, and at the touch the silent knots  \nOf Hell were broken and its sombre dream  \nOf dreadful stately pains at once dispersed.  \nThen as from one whom a surpassing joy  \nHas conquered, all the bright surrounding world  \nStreams swiftly into distance, and he feels  \nHis daily senses slipping from his grasp, p. 27  \nSo that unbearable enormous world  \nWent rolling mighty shades, like the wet mist  \nFrom men on mountain-tops; and sleep outstretched  \nRising its soft arms towards him and his thoughts,  \nAs on a bed, sank to ascending void.\n\nBut when he woke, he heard the koil insist  \nOn sweetness and the voice of happy things  \nContent with sunlight. The warm sense was round him  \nOf old essential earth, known hues and custom  \nFamiliar tranquillising body and mind,  \nAs in its natural wave a lotus feels.  \nHe looked and saw all grass and dense green trees,  \nAnd sunshine and a single grasshopper  \nNear him repeated fierily its note.  \nThrilling he felt beneath his bosom her;  \nOh, warm and breathing were those rescued limbs  \nAgainst the greenness, vivid, palpable, white,  \nWith great black hair and real and her cheek\'s  \nOld softness and her mouth a dewy rose.  \nFor many moments comforting his soul  \nWith all her jasmine body sun-ensnared  \nHe fed his longing eyes and, half in doubt,  \nWith touches satisfied himself of her.  \nHesitating he kissed her eyelids. Sighing  \nWith a slight sob she woke and earthly large  \nHer eyes looked upward into his. She stretched  \nHer arms up, yearning, and their souls embraced;  \nThen twixt brief sobbing laughter and blissful tears,  \nClinging with all her limbs to him, "O love,  \nThe green green world! the warm sunlight!" and ceased,  \nFinding no words; but the earth breathed round them,  \nGlad of her children and the koil\'s voice  \nPersisted in the morning of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
