After having performed the Upakarma for studying the Veda on the full moon\nof the month\' Srava _n_ a (July-August), he shall for one month not study in\nthe evening. 1\n\np. 33\n\n2\\. On the full moon of the month of Pausha (December-January), or under the\nconstellation Rohini, he shall leave off reading the Veda. 2\n\n3\\. Some declare, (that he shall study) for four months and a half. 3\n\n4\\. He shall avoid to Study the Veda on a high-road. 4\n\n5\\. Or he may study it (on a high-road), after having smeared (a space) with\ncowdung.\n\n6\\. He shall never study in a burial-ground nor anywhere near it within the\nthrow of a Samya. 6\n\n7\\. If a village has been built over (a burial ground) or its surface has been\ncultivated as a field, the recitation of the Veda (in such a place) is not\nprohibited.\n\n8\\. But if that place is known to have been a burial-ground he shall not study\n(there). 8\n\np. 34\n\n9\\. A _S_ udra and an outcast are (included by the term) burial-ground, (and\nthe rule given, Sutra 6, applies to them). 9\n\n10\\. Some declare, that (one ought to avoid only, to study) in the same house\n(where they dwell).\n\n11\\. But if (a student and) a _S_ udra woman merely look at each other, the\nrecitation of the Veda must be interrupted,\n\n12\\. Likewise, if (a student and) a woman, who has had connexion with a man of\na lower caste, (look at each other).\n\n13\\. If he, who is about to study the Veda, wishes to talk to a woman during\nher courses, he shall first speak to a Brahma _n_ a and then to her, then\nagain speak to a Brahma _n_ a, and afterwards study. Thereby the children (of\nthat woman) will be blessed. 13\n\n14\\. (He shall not study in a village) in which a corpse lies; 14\n\n15\\. Nor in such a one where Kandalas live.\n\n16\\. He shall not study whilst corpses are being carried to the boundary of\nthe village,\n\n17\\. Nor in a forest, if (a corpse or _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala) is within sight.\n\n18\\. And if outcasts have entered the village, he shall not study on that day,\n18\n\np. 35\n\n19\\. Nor if good men (have come). 19\n\n20\\. If it thunders in the evening, (he shall not study) during the night. 20\n\n21\\. If lightning is seen (in the evening, he shall not study during that\nnight), until he has slept.\n\n22\\. If lightning is seen about the break of dawn, or at the time when he may\ndistinguish at the distance of a Samya-throw, whether (a cow) is black or red,\nbe shall not study during that day, nor in the following evening.\n\n24\\. If it thunders in the second part of the third watch of the night, (he\nshall not study during the following day or evening).\n\n24\\. Some (declare, that this rule holds good, if it thunders), after the\nfirst half of the night has passed.\n\n25\\. (Nor shall he study) whilst the cows are prevented from leaving (the\nvillage on account of thieves and the like),\n\n26\\. Nor (on the imprisonment of criminals) whilst they are being executed.\n\n27\\. He shall not study whilst he rides on beasts (of burden). 27\n\n28\\. At the new moon, (he shall not study) for two days and two nights. 28\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[32:1](sbe0212.htm#fr_245) **9**. The Upakarma is the ceremony which is\nperformed every year at the beginning of the course of study. It is in fact\nthe solemn opening of the Brahmanic term. \'Because \xc3\x82pastamba uses the word\nevening (i.e. first part of the night) it is not sinful to study later in the\nnight.\'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 95; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 142, 143; Weber, Ind. Stud. X.\n130 and 134.\n\n[33:2](sbe0212.htm#fr_246) The term lasts therefore for five months; (i.e.\nlatter half of, Srava _n_ a, Bharapada, \xc3\x82 _s_ vina, Karttika, Margasirsha, and\nthe first half of Pausha.) The Rohini-day of Pausha is meant.\n\n[33:3](sbe0212.htm#fr_247) \'According to this latter opinion the Upakarma\nshould be performed on the full moon of Bhadrapada, as has been taught in\nanother work (Manu IV, 95); the (time of the) Utsargana, (the solemn closing\nof the term) should be advanced; and after the Utsargana has been performed,\none may study the Veda during the light nights of each month until the full\nmoon of Srava _n_ a, in order to fix in one\'s mind the part learned already;\nand in the dark fortnight of each month one may study the Veda\xe1\xb9\x85gas, i.e.\ngrammar and the rest (Manu IV, 98). On the full moon of Srava _n_ a the\nUpakarma should be performed once more, and that part of the Veda should be\nstudied which has not yet been learned.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[33:4](sbe0212.htm#fr_248) Nigarnah, \'high-roads,\' are squares and the like.--\nHaradatta.\n\n[33:6](sbe0212.htm#fr_249) The Samya is either the pin in the bullock\'s yoke\nor the round stick, about a foot and a half in length, which is used for the\npreparation of the Vedi. Manu IV, 116; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 148.\n\n[33:8](sbe0212.htm#fr_250) \'Nor anywhere near it within the throw of a Samyi.\'\nThis must be understood from. Sutra 6.\n\n[34:9](sbe0212.htm#fr_251) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 148.\n\n[34:13](sbe0212.htm#fr_252) The last part of the Sutra may also be\ninterpreted: \'Thus she will be blessed with children.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[34:14](sbe0212.htm#fr_253) Manu IV, 108; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 148.\n\n[34:18](sbe0212.htm#fr_254) Haradatta explains Bahya, \'outcasts,\' by \'robbers,\nsuch as Ugras and Nishadas.\' But, I think, it means simply such outcasts as\nlive in the forest or outside the village in the Vadi, like the Dhers, Mahars,\nMangs of the present day. Most of these tribes however, are or were given to\nthieving. See Kulluka on Manu X, 2 9, and the Petersburg Dict. s. v.\n\n[35:19](sbe0212.htm#fr_255) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 150.\n\n[35:20](sbe0212.htm#fr_256) Manu IV, 106; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 145. This rule refers\nto the rainy season. (For thunder) at other (seasons) he orders below a longer\n(cessation).\'--Haradatta.\n\n[35:27](sbe0212.htm#fr_257) Manu IV, 120; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 151.\n\n[35:28](sbe0212.htm#fr_258) \'"For two days," i.e. on the day of the new moon\nand the preceding one, the fourteenth of the half month.\'--Haradatta. Manu IV,\n113; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 146.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 3, Kha _n_ _d_ a 10](sbe0213.htm)\n\n'
