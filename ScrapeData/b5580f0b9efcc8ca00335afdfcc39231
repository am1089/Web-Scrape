Now (follows) the Upakara _n_ a (i.e. the ceremony by which the annual\ncourse of study is opened).\n\n2 2. When the herbs appear, under the Nakshatra Hasta or _S_ rava _n_ a,\n\n3\\. Let him make oblations of the flour of fried barley and of grains, mixed\nwith curds and ghee, with the (whole) Veda, verse by verse: thus say some\n(teachers).\n\n4 4. Or with the first verses of the Suktas and Anuvakas.\n\n5\\. With the first verses of the Adhyayas and of the sections belonging to the\n(different) _Ri_ shis, according to Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya.\n\n6\\. But Kaushitaki has said:\n\n7\\. 'I praise Agni the Purohita' (Rig-veda I, 1, 1), this one verse,\n\n8\\. 'The Kushumbhaka (mungoose?) has said it;' 'If thou criest, O bird,\nannounce luck to us;' 'Sung by _G_ amadagni;' 'In thy abode the whole world\nrests;'\n\np. 113\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Come to our sacrifice, O you that are worthy of\nsacrifice, with care;' 'Whosoever, be he ours, be he alien;' 'Look on, look\nabout;' 'Come here, Agni, the Maruts\xc2\x92 friend;' 'The oblation, O king, cooked\nfor thee:' each time two verses,\n\n9 9. 'That blessing and bliss we choose'\xc2\x97this one verse (the first and last\nverse of each Ma _n_ _d_ ala).\n\n10\\. (Taking something) of the remnants of the sacrificed (food) they partake\nof that sacrificial food with this (verse), 'I praised Dadhikravan' (Rig-veda\nIV, 39, 6).\n\n11\\. They sip water, sit down,\n\n12\\. Murmur the Mahavyah _ri_ tis, the Savitri, and the auspicious hymns\ncommencing from the beginning of the Veda,\n\n13\\. And cause the teacher to pronounce auspicious wishes.\n\np. 114\n\n14\\. Of this (ceremony) it is also said,\n\n15\\. 'Desirous (of acquiring) for the hymns inexhaustible vigour, reverence,\nand also soundness, the _Ri_ shis, by the power of their austerities, have\ndiscovered the Upakarman.\n\n16 16. 'Therefore a constant performer of the six kinds of works should, in\norder that his Mantras might be successful, perform the Upakarman\xc2\x97so they\nsay\xc2\x97if he wishes for success of his (holy) works.\n\n17 17. 'At the time of the Upakarman and of the Utsarga an interruption (of\nthe Veda-study) shall take place for (three days and) three nights, likewise\nat the Ash _t_ akas for one day and one night, and so on the last night of\neach season.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[112:1](sbe29067.htm#fr_252) 5, 1. As to the Upakara _n_ a, see the statements\nof Professor Weber in his second article on the Nakshatras, Abhandlungen der\nBerliner Akademie, 1861, p. 338, and of Professor Buhler in his notes on\n\xc3\x82pastamba, S.B.E., II, pp. 110, 111.\n\n[112:2](sbe29067.htm#fr_253) The Nakshatra _S_ rava _n_ a is evidently\nconsidered as particularly fit for this occasion because of its name\ncontaining an allusion to _s_ ruti, &c.\n\n[112:4](sbe29067.htm#fr_254) I have followed Naraya _n_ a, but perhaps I ought\nto have translated, 'Suktas or Anuvakas,' and in the fifth Sutra, 'Adhyayas or\nthe sections, &c.'\n\n[113:9](sbe29067.htm#fr_255) According to Kaushitaki, the oblations are made\nwith the first and last _ri_ _k_ as of each Ma _n_ _d_ ala. The last _ri_ _k_\nof the tenth Ma _n_ _d_ ala quoted here, ta _k_ _kh_ a _m_ yor a v _ri_ _n_\nimahe, is different from the verse with which our Sa _m_ hita (the _S_ akala\nSa _m_ hita of the Rig-veda) closes. It is well known that ta _k_ _kh_ a _m_\nyor a v _ri_ _n_ imahe is the last verse in the Bashkala _S_ akha which was\nadopted by the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana school (comp. Indische Studien, IV, 431; Weber,\nVerzeichniss der Berliner Sanskrit-Handschriften, p. 314, &c.; Indische\nLiteraturgeschichte, second edition, Nachtrag, p. 2). It was also known long\nsince that the Bashkala Sakha of the Rig-veda contains eight hymns more than\nthe _S_ akala _S_ akha. The _K_ ara _n_ avyuha Bhashya (comp. Dr. von\nSchroeder's Introduction to his excellent edition of the Maitraya _n_ i Sa _m_\nhita, vol. i, p. xxiv), known to me through the kindness of Professor Weber,\ntells which eight hymns these are. There it is said (folio 22 of Professor\nWeber's MS.) that in the Bashkala Sa _m_ hita there followed after VIII, 48\nthe first two of the Valakhilya hymns, after VIII, 94 the Valakhilya hymns\n3-7, and at the end of the whole collection the so-called sa _m_ _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana\nhymn (see Professor Max Muller's edition, vol. vi, p. 32), which ends with the\nvery verse quoted in our Sutra, ta _k_ _kh_ a _m_ yor a v _ri_ _n_ imahe.\n\n[114:16](sbe29067.htm#fr_256) The six kinds of works are, performing\nsacrifices (ya _g_ ana), officiating at the sacrifices of others (ya _g_ ana),\nstudying the Veda (adhyayana), teaching the Veda to others (adhyapana), giving\n(dana), and accepting gifts (pratigraha). Naraya _n_ a.\n\n[114:17](sbe29067.htm#fr_257) Concerning the Utsarga, see chap. 6. This _S_\nloka occurs also Manu IV, 119 with the reading kshepa _n_ am instead of kshapa\n_n_ am ('kshapa _n_ a _m_ _kh_ andasa _m_ virama anadhyaya _h_ ,' Naraya _n_\na). Kshapa _n_ am is correct.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 6](sbe29068.htm)\n\n"
