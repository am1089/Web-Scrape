I, 12 a): 'Purifiers (or strainers, pavitra) are ye, and belonging to Vish\n_n_ u!' For Vish _n_ u is the sacrifice; so that he thereby says, 'You belong\nto the sacrifice.'\n\n1:1:3:22\\. Two there are of them: for means of cleansing (pavitra) is this\n(wind) which here ventilates (pavate); and this, it is true, ventilates as one\nonly; but on entering into man, it becomes a forward and a backward one, and\nthey are these two, to wit, the pra _n_ a (breathing out) and the udana\n(breathing up or in)  2. And as this (clarifying process) takes place\n\np. 20\n\nin accordance with the measure of that (process of breathing), therefore there\nare two (strainers).\n\n1:1:3:33\\. There may also be three: for the vyana (or pervading vital air) 1\nis a third (kind of breathing); but in reality there are only two. Having then\nstrained the sprinkling water 2 with these two (strainers), he sprinkles with\nit. The reason why he strains it with the two (strainers) is this:\n\n1:1:3:44\\. V _ri_ tra in truth lay covering all this (space) which here\nextends between heaven and earth, And because he lay covering (v _ri_ ) all\nthis, therefore his name is V _ri_ tra.\n\n1:1:3:55\\. Him Indra slew. He being slain flowed forth stinking in all\ndirections towards the water; for in every direction lies the ocean. And in\nconsequence of this, some of the waters became disgusted, and, rising higher\nand higher, flowed over: whence (sprung) these grasses (of which the strainers\nare made; for they represent the water which was not putrified. With the other\n(water), however, some\n\np. 21\n\nmatter has become mixed up, inasmuch as the putrid V _ri_ tra flowed into it.\nThis he now removes from it by means of these two strainers; whereupon he\nsprinkles with the (sacrificially) pure water. This is the reason why he\nstrains it through them.\n\n1:1:3:66\\. He strains it, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 12 b) 'By the impulse\nof Savit _ri_ I purify thee with this flawless purifier (or ventilator,\npavitra), with the rays of the sun!' For Savit _ri_ is the impeller (prasavit\n_ri_ ) of the gods, so that he strains this (water) as one impelled by Savit\n_ri_. 'With this flawless purifier (ventilator, pavitra),' he says, because\nthis (wind) which here ventilates (or purifies, pavate) is a flawless\npurifier. 'With the rays of the sun,' he says, because they, the rays of the\nsun, are certainly purifying; and for this reason he says, 'With the rays of\nthe sun.'\n\n1:1:3:77\\. Having taken it (the water with the ladle) in his left hand, he\nmakes it spirt upwards with his right hand, and eulogises and glorifies it,\nwith the text (Va _g_. S. I, 12 c): 'Shining (or divine) waters! ye the first-\ngoing, the first-drinking 1 ones!' For the waters are shining; and for this\nreason he says, 'Shining waters!' 'First-going,' he calls them, because they\nflow towards the sea and are therefore going in front (or forwards). 'First-\ndrinking,' he calls them, because they are the first that drink of king Soma 2\nand are therefore 'drinking first.' And further: 'Forward now lead this\nsacrifice 3,\n\np. 22\n\nforward the Lord of Sacrifice, the liberal, god-loving Lord of Sacrifice!'\nwhereby he says, 'Well (lead) the sacrifice, well the sacrificer!'\n\n1:1:3:88\\. And further (Va _g_. S. I, 13 a): 'You Indra chose (for his\ncompanions) in the battle against V _ri_ tra!' For Indra, when he was battling\nwith V _ri_ tra, did choose them (the waters) and with their help he killed\nhim; and for this reason he says, 'You Indra chose in the battle against V\n_ri_ tra!'\n\n1:1:3:99\\. 'You chose Indra in the battle against V _ri_ tra!' for they, too,\nchose Indra when he was battling with V _ri_ tra, and with them he killed him:\ntherefore he says, 'You chose Indra in the battle against V _ri_ tra!'\n\n1:1:3:1010\\. And further (Va _g_. S. I, 13 d): 'Consecrated by sprinkling are\nye!' With these words he makes amends to them 1. He then sprinkles the (first)\noblation 2. One and the same meaning applies to the (whole process of)\nsprinkling, viz. he thereby makes sacrificially pure that (which he\nsprinkles).\n\n1:1:3:1111\\. He sprinkles, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 13 e): 'Thee,\nagreeable to Agni, I sprinkle!' Thus for whichever deity the oblation is\nintended, for that one he thereby renders it sacrificially pure. When he has\nin the same way as before sprinkled (all) the oblations,--\n\n1:1:3:1212\\. He then sprinkles the sacrificial vessels 3,\n\np. 23\n\nwith the text (Va _g_. S. I, 13 g), 'Be ye pure for the divine work, for the\nsacrifice to the gods!' for it is for the divine work, the sacrifice to the\ngods, that he consecrates them. 'Whatever, that belongs to you, the impure\nhave defiled by touching, that I hereby purify for you!' For whatever\nbelonging to them some impure one--either a carpenter or some other impure\nperson--has on this occasion desecrated by touching, that he thereby renders\nsacrificially pure for them by means of the water; and therefore he says,\n'Whatever, that belongs to you, the impure have defiled by touching, that I\nhereby purify for you [1](sbe1206.htm#fn_120)!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[19:1](sbe1205.htm#fr_110) These strainers (or clarifiers) are to consist of\ntwo blades of Ku _s_ a grass, with unbroken or undecayed tops, and without\nbuds on them; and they must be severed from their roots by means of other Ku\n_s_ a blades, so as to be of equal length (viz. one prade _s_ a, or span of\nthumb and fore-finger, long). Katy. Sr. II, 3, 31.\n\n[19:2](sbe1205.htm#fr_111) Thus Saya _n_ a here takes the terms pra _n_ a (i\n_d_ api\xe1\xb9\x85galadina _d_ idvara bahir nirga _k_ _kh_ an pra _n_ a _h_ pra\xe1\xb9\x85) and\nudana (tathaiva dvara punar anta _h_ pravi _s_ an pratya\xe1\xb9\x85). In Ait. Br. II,\n29, and _Kh_ and. Up. I, 3, 3, pra _n_ a, apana, and vyana are mentioned as\nthe p. 20 three vital airs; where pra _n_ a is taken by Professors Haug and\nMuller as 'in-breathing' ('respiration' or 'expiration,' Roer), and apana as\n'out-breathing' ('inspiration,' Roer). Five vital airs are generally\nenumerated ( _S_ at. Br. IX, 2, 2, 5); but theological speculation evidently\nconsidered these bodily processes a very convenient source of symbolism, as we\nfind mention made in the _S_ at. Br. of six (XIV, 1, 3, 32); seven (III, 1, 3,\n21; XIII, 1, 7, 2); nine (I, 5, 2, 5); and ten (XI, 6, 3, 7) breaths or vital\nairs.\n\n[20:1](sbe1205.htm#fr_112) 'A combination of the out-breathing and in-\nbreathing;' but as there is no distinction between this kind of breath and the\nothers (combined), two must be considered as the normal number of strainers.\nSchol.\n\n[20:2](sbe1205.htm#fr_113) He pours water into the Agnihotra ladle (in which\nsome of the awn of the rice remains), and after cleaning it with the two\nstrainers, he sprinkles with it. Katy. II, 3, 33 seq. The details of this\nprocess are given in par. 6 seq.\n\n[21:1](sbe1205.htm#fr_114) Agrepuva _h_ ; Mahidhara allows to it the\nalternative meaning first-purifying:\n\n[21:2](sbe1205.htm#fr_115) 'Because, for the sake of extracting the juice from\nthe Soma-plants, water is poured on them, so that the water drinks of the\njuice before the gods do.' Say.\n\n[21:3](sbe1205.htm#fr_116) I, e. 'carry the sacrifice through without\nhindrance.' Mahidh.\n\n[22:1](sbe1205.htm#fr_117) He, in the first place, sprinkles the sprinkling\nwater in the ladle with itself; and the guilt incurred in the act of\nconsecrating it with itself, that is, with something unconsecrated, is made\namends for by the accompanying formula, Say. Similarly Mahidhara: 'The\nunconsecrated (water) cannot consecrate other (water).'\n\n[22:2](sbe1205.htm#fr_118) Before doing so he asks the Brahman's permission\n(cf. [p. 7](sbe1203.htm#page_7), note [1](sbe1203.htm#fn_90)), 'O Brahman!\nshall I sprinkle the oblation?' when the latter, after muttering the mantra,\n'Sprinkle the sacrifice! gladden the deities,' &c., gives the permission by\n'\xc3\x95m! sprinkle!' Paddh. on Katy. II, 3, 36.\n\n[22:3](sbe1205.htm#fr_119) According to some authorities the vessels are\nplaced together p. 23 on one heap, and are then consecrated together by one\nsprinkling. According to others, each vessel must be consecrated separately.\nKaty. _S_ r. II, 3, 39.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe1206.htm)\n\n"
