Thou art an Angiras, O gangida, a protector art thou, O gangida. All two-\nfooted and four-footed creatures that belong to us the gangida shall protect!  \n2\\. The sorceries fifty-three in number, and the hundred performers of\nsorcery, all these having lost their force, the gangida shall render bereft of\nstrength!  \n3\\. Bereft of strength is the gotten-up clamour, bereft of strength are the\nseven debilitating (charms). Do thou, O gangida, hurl away from here poverty,\nas an archer an arrow!  \n4\\. This gangida is a destroyer of witchcraft, and also a destroyer of hostile\npowers. May then the powerful gangida extend far our lives!  \n5\\. May the greatness of the gangida protect us about on all sides, (the\ngreatness) with which he has overcome the vishkandha (and) the samskandha,\n(overcoming the powerful (disease) with power!  \n6\\. Thrice the gods begot thee that hast grown up upon the earth. The\nBrahmanas of yore knew thee here by the name of Angiras.  \n7\\. Neither the plants of olden times, nor they of recent times, surpass thee;\na fierce slayer is the gahaida, and a happy refuge.  \n8 And when, O gangida of boundless virtue, thou didst spring up in the days of\nyore, O fierce (plant), Indra at first placed strength in thee.  \n9\\. Fierce Indra, verily, put might into thee, O lord of the forest!\nDispersing all diseases, slay thou the Rakshas, O plant!  \nI o. The breaking disease and the tearing disease, the balasa, and the pain in\nthe limbs, the takman that comes every autumn, may the gangida render devoid\nof force!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIX, 35.
