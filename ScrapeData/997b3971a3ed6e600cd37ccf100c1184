They desire\nabove all things that, in their humble way, these books shall be the\nambassadors of good-will and understanding between East and West--the old\nworld of Thought and the new of Action. In this endeavour, and in their own\nsphere, they are but followers of the highest example in the land. They are\nconfident that a deeper knowledge of the great ideals and lofty philosophy of\nOriental thought may help to a revival of that true spirit of Charity which\nneither despises nor fears the nation of another creed and colour.\n\nL.
