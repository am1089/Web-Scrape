Having before the sacrifice gone round the fire, so that their right sides\nare turned towards it,\n\n2. 2 They sit down in their former position, and while she takes hold of him, he offers the oblations (indicated by the) next (Mantras), with (the Mantras), \'To Soma, the acquirer of a wife, Svaha!\' (M. I, 4, I-16), one oblation with each Mantra.\n\n3. 3 He then causes her, to the north of the fire, to tread with her right foot on a stone, with (the verse), \'Tread\' (M. I, 5, 1).\n\n4\\. Having \'spread under\' \xc3\x82 _g_ ya into her joined hands, he pours roasted\ngrain twice (into them), and sprinkles \xc3\x82 _g_ ya over it.\n\n5\\. Some say that an uterine relation of hers pours the grain (into her\nhands).\n\n6. 6 He (?) sacrifices (that grain) with (the verse), \'This wife\' (M. I, 5, 2).\n\n7. 7 Having gone round the fire, with the right side turned towards it, with the next three (verses; M. I, 5, 3-5) he makes her tread on the stone as above (M. I, 5, 6).\n\n8\\. And the oblation (is performed) with the next (verse; M. I, 5, 7).\n\n9\\. (Then follow) again the circumambulation (M. I, 5, 8-10), the injunction\nto tread on the stone\n\np. 261\n\n[paragraph continues] (I, 5, 11), and the oblation with the next (verse; I, 5,\n12);\n\n10\\. (Then) the circumambulation again (I, 5, 13-15).\n\n11. 11 He enters upon the performance of the _G_ aya and following oblations.\n\n12. 12 Having performed (the rites) down to the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire), and having untied the rope with the next two verses (I, 5, 16. 17), he should then make her depart (from her father\'s house in a vehicle), or should have her taken away.\n\n13\\. Having put that fire (with which the marriage rites have been performed,\ninto a vessel), they carry it behind (the newly-married couple).\n\n14\\. It should be kept constantly.\n\n15\\. If it goes out, (a new fire) should be kindled by attrition,\n\n16\\. Or it should be fetched from the house of a _S_ rotriya.\n\n17\\. Besides, if (the fire) goes out, one of them, either the wife or the\nhusband, should fast.\n\n18\\. Or he may sacrifice with the next (verse; M. I, 5, 18), and not fast.\n\n19\\. The next (verse; M. I, 6, 1) is for putting the chariot (on which the\nyoung couple is to depart), in position;\n\n20\\. With the next two (verses; M. I, 6, 2. 3), he puts the two animals to the\nchariot;\n\n21\\. First the right one.\n\n22\\. When she mounts (the chariot), he recites over her the next (verses; M.\nI, 6, 4-7).\n\np. 262\n\n23\\. With the next (verse; M. I, 6, 8), he spreads out two threads in the\nwheel-tracks (in which the chariot is to go), a dark-blue one in the right\n(track), a red one in the left.\n\n24\\. With the next (verses; M. I, 6, 9-11), he walks on these (threads).\n\n25\\. And when they pass by bathing-places, posts, or cross-roads, let him\nmurmur the next (verse; M. I, 6, 12).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[260:2](sbe30098.htm#fr_735) 5, 2.
