Civilisation and religion are born amongst peasants, become\naggressive amongst sailors, and are passed from one to the other by the nomad\nraces of the desert strip.\n\nFor adequate culture-histories of Venice, Genoa, and the Crusades, the world\nis still waiting. When they are written, men will be astonished to learn both\nhow completely Europe is indebted to Asia, and also how far the Semitic races\nhave been in modern times the stewards of that debt.\n\nIt has been administered through the Jew as well as the Mussulman. But the Jew\nwas the spiritual heir of Egypt, and as such could not individualise the\ndesert pure and simple. His religious ideas were too complex, his social\nsystem too exclusive, his national sentiment too unfixed. When he ceased to be\na peasant in Syria, the world was before him as scholar and trader.\n\nTo the Arab, on the other hand, belonged the\n\np. 222\n\nshifting constancy of the desert sands. No luxury of cities could fire him\nwith ambition to leave home and kindred, the scanty fare and hardy contests of\nhis youth, that he might eat well and sleep soft amongst aliens. To this day\nthe seamen in the Red Sea or the Indian Ocean will pass those curious, square-\nsailed boats known as Arab dhows, and will carelessly shout their bearings in\nanswer to the inquiry of the navigators within, who are steering their way on\nthe ocean as they would across the desert, by the position of the sun. But\nthese boats are rude merchantmen merely, not emigrant vessels. They are going\nout, only that they may return and enrich their own people with the benefits\nof trade. When the Arab of old did set his eyes upon the capitals of the world\nit was to possess them. He went forth in his armies, taking his kindred with\nhim, and seated himself in their palaces, upon their thrones. And yet the city\nwhere that idea of his own solidarity was born which enabled the Mussulman to\nignore petty feuds for a great unifying idea, was the open port of its day and\nplace, and the Prophet himself was more travelled than most of his\ncontemporaries. It is always so. Behind the rise of a world-swaying idea there\nis always the sentiment of the advancement of truth, the impulse to assimilate\nall that is newest and best in foreign influences; there is always, too, the\npower of outlook in more than common degree. Mohammed had reached his burning\ntenderness for his own people, and his consciousness of a national perplexity,\nby direct contact with Syrian market-places and Byzantine townsfolk. Long\ntalks beside the caravan fires at night with men of many different nations,\nhad given him his education, setting dim thoughts and mighty longings vaguely\nastir within him. It is difficult for the modern world to realise the\nlargeness of primitive thought and personality. We\n\np. 223\n\nfeel that we have triumphed mightily in the invention of the steam-engine and\nthe railway train; and so, along one line, we have. We forget, however, that\nhenceforth the leader of our travel is to be a mere mechanic, managing a few\ncog-wheels, and superintending water and coal. Once upon a time, in the same\ncapacity, he was something of patriarch, savant, poet, and ship\'s captain all\nin one.\n\nSimilarly of the personal courage required in war, and the breadth of nature-\npainting in early literature. The progress of time and thought means the\ndeterioration of these qualities. No modern poet can speak of the sunset like\na Red Indian. No user of Maxim guns has the personal prowess of an old-time\npirate. Strong individuality is demanded by undeveloped, unregimented\nconditions, and later civilisation is only a specialisation upon this, growing\nby degrees more subtle and detailed, in which the man has often lost in\nproportion as the institution has gained.\n\nDepth of observation, vastness and nobility of hope, and wealth of assimilated\nexperience--all, in short, that constitutes essential education--are often but\ninversely proportioned to literacy. Therefore there is no room for the\nlibrary-and-museum learned of the twentieth century to refer to a camel-driver\nof the seventh as ignorant. The Prophet Mohammed can have been nothing of the\nsort. With rare beauty and sweetness of nature, he combined social and\npolitical genius, towering manhood, and an intellectual culture of no mean\nkind. As has so often been the case with the initiators of new faiths, he was\nin a special sense the blossom of the old, for not only were his family the\nguardians of the Kaabah, but his father had been intended in his childhood to\nbe a sacrifice to the gods, and Mohammed was an only son, early orphaned.\nIndeed, had he belonged to any city but Mecca, the pilgrim-centre of the\nArabian\n\np. 224\n\npeninsula, he could not possibly have seen the Islamising of the whole Arab\npeople within his single lifetime.\n\nWe think of the Prophet too much as the preacher of a religion, too little as\nthe maker of a nationality. We hear the Name of God so frequently that we\nforget the love of humanity that is taught. We fail, in short, to understand\nthe Asiatic character both of messenger and message.\n\nIn the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.\n\nBut the word that follows argues little enough, at least in early days, about\nthe Unity of God. After all, this is a fact that we recognise instinctively.\nNo man, least of all the dweller in the desert, in his heart believes that God\nis two. The Prophet\'s first task is to give life and vigour to this supreme\nintuition by making it only the starting-point of a searching appeal to\nconscience, an authoritative condemnation of insincerity and evil custom, and\nterrible pictures of judgment and hell-fire. In all this he must only have\nuttered what was already in the air. Social life in Arabia must have been ripe\nfor change. The sacredness of property, the protection of childhood, and the\nfixing of woman\'s status, had already doubtless been felt as necessities by\ngood men of all tribes and cities. But the gigantic power of conviction that\ncould use these very reforms as a means of welding the scattered and divided\nkinships into a single brotherhood, fired with a common purpose of\nrighteousness and armed with the mighty weapon of a divine mission--this was\nthe sole right of one whose boyhood had been spent among the sheepfolds, and\nwhose manhood had known the solitary watch, with the awful trance of\nrevelation, in the mountain caves.\n\nFrom one point of view, Islam represents a transition\n\np. 225\n\nbetween Asia and Europe. An Asiatic people takes on the consolidation, the\nmobility, and the militarism of a European State. It anticipates the West in\nso doing by many a century. It accomplishes the Napoleonic task of destroying\nthe Persian and Byzantine empires, and setting itself up in their place; and\nyet, inasmuch as it does all this in the strength of an idea, inasmuch as its\nsanction lies in one man\'s superconscious inspiration, it remains at heart\nprofoundly Asiatic.\n\nThe relation between the master and his disciples is always one of the most\nvital elements in the life of Asia. In this case, whole nations are the\ndisciples of a single man. They are taken into his kindred. They form his\nfamily. They strive to approximate to his method of life--in dress, food,\nmanners, even to some extent in language. Whenever they pray, they place\nthemselves mentally in Arabia. Such facts make religion in the East a matter\nof enormous social consequence. The convert in India immediately changes his\nstyle of cookery. One can eat a dinner in that country, Hindu, Mohammedan,\nParsi, Jain, Jewish, Christian or Buddhist in kind; but assuredly without\nchanging his food no man could be held to have sincerely changed his faith. It\nis inevitable, therefore, that communities which accept the creed of Islam\nshould become Arabised in every possible way.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that they should remake the desert. Mohammed\'s\nwhole polity made towards settled and industrial conditions. His last great\nspeech, in which he gathers all his people together, knowing not if he shall\never again address them, reminds them of the sacredness of private property,\nand the rights of women, slaves and children. Nor was there any barbarism\nabout the Mohammedan empires of the next six or seven centuries. Western Asia\ndid not fail to build itself\n\np. 226\n\nupon the arts of the Roman Empire, did not fail to assimilate Hellenic\nculture, and to display an original impetus in science, from the blending of\nGreek and Oriental elements: The history of the great Spanish schools is too\nwell known to need comment. The splendours of the Abbasside Caliphs at Baghdad\nwere well borne out by the Ommiades at Cordova, and an architecture that\ndeserves to be the wonder of the world was the fruit of Saracenic\ncivilisation. The blasting of Persia, Syria, and Asia Minor, would seem to\nhave been the work of the Mogul invasions of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane, in\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. These invasions sound through the\npages of history like irruptions of subterranean forces. They were similar to,\nbut incomparably vaster than, those which brought about the sack of Rome by\nAlaric and Genseric, and which left the city and Campagna, under the\nguardianship of monks, to the insidious decay of many centuries. The\ngeographical position of the Eternal City and her surroundings was, however,\nsome protection, whereas the Eastern provinces were exposed to the tramp and\nre-tramp of every hostile force. Gibbon says of Genghis Khan that he destroyed\nin four days what five hundred years had not sufficed to restore. The common\nstatement that the blighting of Asia Minor has been the work of Mohammedanism\nmay therefore be put down to historical ignorance and theological prejudice.\n\nThe utmost stigma that can attach to Saracenic governments has been that they\nhave not had the energy and patience to bend themselves in such cases to the\nincredible task of beginning all over again the work of civilisation and\npolity. But are they peculiar in this? Would France, England, or Italy--were\nthe past blotted out, and all sovereign and responsible persons removed, as at\na single\n\np. 227\n\nblow--show more courage, more persistence, than the Arab or the Turk? The very\ngrandeur of the cities that had vanished would add to the hopeless inactivity\nof the generations that found themselves orphaned and despoiled. An additional\nfactor in the case is--not the genius of Islam, whose purely destructive and\ndesolating tendencies may at least be questioned by those who have seen its\nwork in India, but--the nature of all conquests. The whole opportunity of a\nconqueror lies in the loyal submission of himself to the past of the\nconquered. Failing this, the structure that he rears must be, if not\ndestructive, at least evanescent. No power remains at its height for ever; and\nin this decline, the ability to guard with decency and stability what it has\ncreated, preserving the hope and possibility of resurrection, will depend\nexactly on the amount of force that was put into that creation.\n\nIt is a curious fact that from the Parthenon to the Taj Mahal, the appearance\nof a memorable national art has always been coeval with the existence of a\npowerful centralising consciousness. Pericles adorned Athens with the tribute\nof the Greek States. Ancient Rome was decorated with the trophies of the\nworld. Mediaeval cathedrals and town-halls grew out of the vigorous craft and\nmunicipal solidarity. Florence and the Vatican were the blossoms of the\nChurch. The commercial nexus of Venice was an empire wide as the planet. The\ndiggers of Buddhist cave-temples in India, and the builders of Indo-Saracenic\npalaces and tombs, alike worked under the shadow of imperial thrones, which\narticulated for them the enthusiasm of the wholeness of things.\n\nBut what of a flower without leaf, stem and root? Times of blossom are few and\nfar between, at least equally sacred and important is the task of maintaining\nand increasing the common life. Even so with\n\np. 228\n\nthe growth of nations. The humble, mole-like work of developing civilisation\nthrough the daily life and the simple home, is still more important than the\nephemeral glory of an age of exploitation, and the persistence of a\nnationality is assuredly proportionate to the degree in which it represents\nthe utmost of such unseen, steady, and joyous co-operation amongst its\nmembers.\n\nIt may be charged indeed against the flying squadrons of the desert that of\nsuch slow-accumulating toil they brought too little to the making of Baghdad,\nand the ruling of Damascus. It may be urged that in the stimulating union of\nChinese, Hindu, Persian and Hellenic elements, over which the Arab there\nreigned supreme, there was too little intensity of culture and research; that\nthe regal race was content to furnish its universities with translations only\nof the foreign texts on which so much of their learning was based; that there\nwas too marked a tendency to despise the associations of its subjects; too\ngreat a readiness to build its own mosques out of the ruins of their palaces;\nand finally, that to a struggle so easy, an end was inevitable, a decay as\nlong and inglorious as its triumph had been brilliant and short-lived. Such\narguments may be true, but their truth constitutes a reproach against all\nconquests, not a stain on the Arab faith.\n\nII\n\nNo one can stand and face the ruins behind the Kutb-Minar * at Delhi, no one\ncan realise, even dimly, the beauty of Persian poetry, without understanding\nthat Arab, Slav, Afghan, and Mogul came to India as the emissaries of a\nculture different\n\np. 229\n\nindeed from, but not less imposing than, that of the people of the soil. The\narches in the broken screen of Altamish, as it is called, which are all that\nremains of a mosque of the twelfth century, are as perfect in taste and\ndevotional feeling as anything in the Gothic. The complete building must have\nlacked somewhat in weight and solidity, but it was not the work of ruffians\nand barbarians, nor were the men who thronged to it for prayer, mere lovers of\nwanton destruction.\n\nA Hindu historian would have the first right to chant the pan of the Mussulman\nfaith, for it was upon Akbar, a sovereign of that creed, that the inspiration\ndawned to make a nation and a nationality out of the peoples of modern India.\n\nThe sixteenth century in Europe has been known as the era of great kings. Leo\nX. of the Papacy, Charles V. of the Empire, Henry IV. of France, and Elizabeth\nof England, are amongst the strongest personalities to whom thrones were ever\ngiven. And if we take the English Tudors alone, we shall find four notable\nfigures, with strong policies of their own, out of the five members of that\ndynasty. About the last two, there is, however, one peculiarity. Even those\nwho sympathise most strongly with the Catholic Queen would probably recognise\nthat it was well for the country that Elizabeth reigned after her, and not\nbefore. Few would dispute the greater statesmanship, and more synthetic\ncharacter of the policy, of the latter of these two sovereigns. Indeed the\nfact is well enough proved by the loyalty and enthusiasm with which her\nCatholic subjects united with the Protestant to repel the Spanish Armada.\n\nThe history of India, from the middle of the sixteenth to the end of the\nseventeenth centuries, displays a curious parallelism and contrast to this of\nEngland during the sixteenth. The reign of\n\np. 230\n\n[paragraph continues] Akbar was contemporary with that of Elizabeth, and, with\na still greater statesmanship and breadth of mind and heart, he undertook to\ninaugurate a vast national, as distinguished from a sectarian policy. Few\nindeed of the world\'s monarchs have ever used so marvellous an opportunity\nwith such wisdom and magnanimity as this Emperor of Delhi. An almost equal\nsympathy with the speculations of all religions, a deep understanding and\nadmiration of the old Indian system, with a desire only to complete and\nextend, never to nullify it; a love of everything that was national, with a\nhabit of striking swiftly and pardoning generously--all these qualities gave\nAkbar a place in the hearts of his subjects which makes "Secundra, the Great,"\na sufficient name for him to this day. He had been born in a Rajput household,\nand his greatest act, after the modelling of his administration on the ancient\n"dharmma," was the marrying of a Hindu princess, and making her the mother of\nthe heir-apparent. Aurungzeeb was the first of his successors who was not\nIndian in this complete sense, of having had a Mussulman father and a Hindu\nmother.\n\nAkbar\'s three immediate descendants--Jehangir, his son, Shah Jehan, his\ngrandson, and Aurungzeeb, his great-grandson--were all men of marked ability.\nThey retained intact the empire which his genius had consolidated. But\nunfortunately, of them all, Aurungzeeb\'s was the sectarian and somewhat\nnarrowly devotional temperament of the English Catholic queen, better fitted\nto make him a saint of Islam than welder of the Indian nationality; and Shah\nJehan alone had a genius of administration comparable to his grandfather\'s of\ninitiation. In other words, India had the misfortune in her own case to see\nElizabeth succeeded, not preceded by Mary.\n\nSuch were the four great Moguls, whose united\n\np. 231\n\nreigns began two years before the accession of Elizabeth, and ended at the\ndate of the Parliamentary union of England and Scotland, scarcely yet two\nhundred years ago. Their Tartar blood, for they came of the race of Tamerlane,\ngave them unflagging energy and perseverance. Their Mohammedan faith gave them\nstrength and simplicity of creed, unexhausted by the three hundred years\'\nadhesion of their tribes. Their soldierly origin gave them the power to adopt\nthe ruder side of military life at a moment\'s notice, while, at the same time,\nall their habits and associations imposed on them the power and means of\nunequalled splendour. Such were they all; but of them all, Akbar stands\nunrivalled in liberal statesmanship, and Shah Jehan in personal genius.\n\nIn the hands of this last monarch the unity of India became a visible fact,\nsymbolised by the dazzling beauty of his building, and even Leo X. must give\nway to him for taste. Now it was the Taj, raising its stately head above its\njewelled walls and lace-carved windows of white marble, in inconsolable love\nand sorrow. Again, it was the Pearl Mosque of Agra, vast in proportion and\nalmost unadorned, in severity of creamy stone, of sun-steeped court, and\nshadowed aisles and sanctuary. Yet once more some dainty palace or exquisite\noratory, the baths of an empress or the hall of audience of a king, testified\nto the fact that a lord of artists sat upon the throne. But it was not only in\nwhite marble that Shah Jehan gave the reins to his pride in the Indian soil\nand the Indian people. He built the modern Delhi, with her red walls, her\nbroad streets, and her magnificent fortress. He made the peacock throne, of\ngold and jewels, which was removed to Persia by Nadir Shah a hundred years\nlater. He and his court and household were collectors of choice hooks and\npictures. And, like all the\n\np. 232\n\n[paragraph continues] Moguls, he was himself a past master in the art of\nilluminating manuscripts.\n\nNot the least part of the beauty of his buildings lies in the acoustic\nproperties of their domes, which act as bells, taking up every whisper and\ngroan that may sound below them, and making it into music in the height above.\nThere is no voice so harsh or vulgar that it is not in their presence made\nrich and harmonious; and if any poor old Mussulman be asked why every mosque\nis domed, he will answer in bewilderment that he can only suppose that it is\nto make the name of Allah resound again and again.\n\nIn all this Shah Jehan proved himself the monarch, not of some section, but of\nall his subjects, and as such he is regarded by India to this day. He might\nnot be in active sympathy with every phase of the popular creeds, but there is\nnone who is cut off from sympathy with him. The enthusiasm that spoke in his\nworks is deeply understood. His addition of a third style to the architectural\nglories of the country is never forgotten. And it is still remembered by the\npeople that, according to the unanimous voice of history, India was never so\nwell administered as in his day.\n\nThe Mohammedan brought roses into India. "They are of the caste of the\nemperors," said a Hindu, sitting near, as two beggars came into my verandah in\na southern province and offered me these flowers, "they are of the caste of\nthe emperors. Even their begging is that of kings!"\n\nThe remark is significant of a liberalising influence upon social usage\nwherever the Mogul Empire has penetrated; for orthodox Hinduism is perhaps a\nlittle too barren of all luxury, a little too much hemmed-in by strict\nrequirements and consideration of the highest motives. "The West," it has been\nsaid, "has mastered the knowledge of the\n\np. 233\n\nways and means of life, and this the East may well accept from her."\nMohammedanism is much more than a half-way house towards the point at which\nsuch knowledge becomes possible. It is even said sometimes by Hindus that no\ngentleman can fulfil the requirements of modern life unless he have a\nMohammedan servant.\n\nThe very courtesy of Mohammedan bearing speaks of palaces and of military\nlife. Were India an independent country, her most important embassies would\ndoubtless be filled by Moslems. The act of salutation is almost as a devotion\namongst the sons and daughters of Islam. The pause of reverence, the evident\ndepth of feeling with which the hand of the elder is lifted by the younger to\nthe forehead and then kissed, the beautiful words, "Salaam alaikum!" ("Peace\nbe unto you!"), which accompany a bow--all these things are the tokens of a\nculture of humanity which produces a depth of sympathy and tenderness not\nunworthy of that Prophet whose burning love of God found no adequate\nexpression save in the love and service of man. It is a humanity in which\nstill breathes the fragrance of that great pastoral peace of desert and steppe\nwhich is the living force and unity of the whole Moslem world, however the\naccidents of time or place may seem to betray it. The patriarch seated at his\ntent door welcoming strangers, loving and just in his dealings with wives and\nkindred, trusted and revered by all his tribe, and giving his very heart, as\nis the fashion of the men of Islam, to little children, is an integral\nimagination of the race. There is nothing in the world so passionately tender\nas a Hindu mother, unless it be a Mohammedan father,\n\nIt is this human aspect of the Arab faith that prepares us for its\nproselytising power in India. It represents to the low-caste Hindu what the\nBuddhist\n\np. 234\n\norders once represented--a perfect democracy, in which stains of birth, of\nblood, of occupation, are all blotted out by the utterance of the formula of\nfraternity, "There is no God but God, and Mohammed is his Prophet." However\nlow and degraded was a man\'s past, he may now be and do whatever he desires\nand can. The word "Sheikh" prefixed to his name indicates that he comes of a\nfamily so adopted by conversion; and the vast majority of Mohammedan\ncultivators, boatmen, and builders in India, are thus Hindu by blood and\ninstinct, and Moslem by creed. The gods of the old faith become the saints or\n"pirs" of the new. They pray at their tombs _to_ the dead, as well as _for_\nthem, and are regarded indulgently by the orthodox and learned of their new\nfaith as illiterate, and therefore superstitious. That brotherhood which is\ntalked of by Christianity is realised by Islam. The message of the Prophet is\na message of humanity and freedom to the whole race of man.\n\nMost religions have two phases: one the Puritan, and the other the ornate. The\nPuritan side of Islam finds expression in the Sunni sect, and the ornate\naspect in the Shiah. It is the Shiahs who commemorate the Caliph Ali and the\ndeaths of Hassan and Hussain. They carry the tombs of the martyrs in\nprocession at the Mohurrum, and whenever they are bereaved they mourn for the\nfamily of Ali instead of for their own. Geographically, the Shiahs are\nPersian, and in India are most numerous in Bengal and round Lucknow. The\nsterner and narrower teachings of Sunni-ism formed the royal faith of Delhi\nand Hyderabad. Besides these, there is a third sect of Mohammedans in India,\nknown as the Wahabi. This is described somewhat satirically as the religion of\nthose who had one parent a Shiah, and the other a Sunni. It is in fact a\nmodern reform. As amongst Hindus, however, his particular\n\np. 235\n\nshade of religion is a matter of the individual\'s own choice, and the women\nare even more pronounced than the men, regarding personal doctrinal\nconviction.\n\nThe influence of the Indian environment is felt, further, in many of the\nsocial developments of the Islamic community. It is not unnatural that there\nshould be a great aptitude for the formation of castes, and a stern refusal to\nbreak bread with those who are not of the chosen group. In other directions\nalso there is an approximation of custom. Many Mussulman families in Bengal\nwould turn with horror from the eating of beef. The wife insists that her own\nhands and no others shall cook the food eaten by the husband. The re-marriage\nof widows is discountenanced by the highest standards of taste, and in the\nroyal family of Delhi the life of a widowed princess was spent exactly like\nthat of a Hindu woman who had lost her husband--in austerity, prayer, and\nstudy. Finally, that hymn to the Ganges which is among the first things learnt\nby a Hindu child, was written three or four centuries ago by a Mussulman.\n\nOn its divine side, ignoring those dim reaches of Sufi-ism which only the\nsaints attain, and where all saints, of all faiths, are at one, ignoring, too,\nall sectarian differences as between Sunnis and Shiahs, Islam stands in India\nas another name for _bhakti_ , or the melting love of God. In the songs of the\npeople the Hindu name of _Hari_ , and the Mohammedan _Allah_ are inextricably\nblended, and as one listens to the boatmen singing while they mend their nets,\none cannot distinguish the hymn from the poem of love.\n\nIt was Mohammed\'s realisation of God\'s love for man, however little he may\nhave put it into words, that thrilled through the Arab world, and drew the\ntribes as one man, to fight beneath his banner. His\n\np. 236\n\nwas no triumph of the fear and majesty of God. Five times every day, after his\nablutions, does the pious Mohammedan turn towards Mecca and say:\n\nPraise be to God, the Lord of the worlds,  \nThe compassionate, the merciful. King of the day of judgment!  \nThee we worship, and Thee we ask for help.  \nGuide us in the straight way,  \nThe way of those to whom Thou art gracious;  \nNot of those upon whom is Thy wrath, nor of the erring.\n\nAnd again:\n\nSay: He is one God;  \nGod the Eternal.  \nHe begetteth not, nor is begotten;  \nNor is there one like unto Him.\n\nThe prayer and creed, for all their ring of pride and awe, are not the words\nof beaten slaves, but of loved and loving children, confident of the depth of\nthat mercy whereto they appeal. Something there was indeed in the fierce\nethical passion of Mohammed, the basis of his piercing appeal to the\nconscience of his people, which might look like terrorism. If all men knew of\nhell and judgment, he said, what he did, there would be little laughter and\nmuch weeping amongst them. But all this is on behalf of conscience and the\nvoice of righteousness. A nature itself so radiant in compassion for women,\nfor the poor, for slaves, and for dumb beasts, could not long remain in\ncontemplation of the terrors of the Divine. Throughout the creation he sees\none law writ large, "Verily my compassion overcometh my wrath," and Mohammed,\nwho believes in austerity, but not in self-mortification, feels all the\npassion of the Flagellant, as he utters the word Islam, or uttermost surrender\nof self to the Truth that is in God.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[228:*](wil16.htm#fr_37) Kutb-Minar, a famous tower or minaret, about eleven\nmiles from Delhi.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XV.
