(Should it be said that distinction of pleasure, pain, &c., results) from\n(difference of) place; we say no, on account of the (Self's) being within (all\nthings).\n\nHere it might be objected that, although all Selfs are all-pervading, yet\ntheir conjunction with the internal organ which is seated in the body must\ntake place in that part of each Self which is limited by the body; and that\nthus there may result from difference of locality a limitative distinction of\nresolutions, &c., of the ad _ri_ sh _t_ a, and of pleasure and pain.--This\nalso, we reply, is not possible 'on account of the being within.' For, as\nbeing equally infinite, all Selfs are within all bodies. Thus the Vai _s_\neshikas have no right whatever to assume any part of the Self to be limited by\nthe body. And if they do assume such a part of the Self which in reality is\nwithout any parts, that part because merely assumptive will be incapable of\nlimiting a real effect. Moreover, it is impossible to limit the body which\noriginates in proximity to all (omnipresent) Selfs to one particular Self to\nthe exclusion of all others. Moreover, on the doctrine of limitation due\n\np. 72\n\nto difference of place, it would follow that sometimes two Selfs enjoying the\nsame pleasure or pain might effect their fruition by one and the same body,\nsince it may happen that the unseen principle of two Selfs occupies the same\nplace. For we may observe, e.g. that after Devadatta's body has moved away\nfrom a certain spot in which Devadatta had enjoyed a certain amount of\npleasure or pain, and the body of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ adatta has moved into that very\nsame place, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ adatta enjoys an equal amount of pleasure or pain; a\nthing which (on the theory discussed) could not happen if the unseen\nprinciples of the two men did not occupy the same place. From the doctrine\nthat the unseen principles occupy fixed places it would, moreover, follow that\nno enjoyment of the heavenly world, &c. can take place; for the ad _ri_ sh _t_\na is effected in definite places such as e.g. the body of a Brahma _n_ a, and\nthe enjoyment of the heavenly world is bound to a definite different place.--\nIt further 1 is impossible to maintain that there exist many all-pervading\nSelfs 2, as there are no parallel instances. Mention if you can a plurality of\nother things occupying the same place!--You will perhaps bring forward colour\nand so on 3. But we refuse to accept that instance as parallel, because\ncolour, &c., although non-different in so far as they are attributes of one\nsubstance, yet differ through their essential characteristics. On the other\nhand there is no difference of characteristics between your (alleged) many\nSelfs. If you say that a difference of characteristics can be established on\nthe ground of the ultimate special differences (of all substances), we point\nout that you implicate yourself in a logical circle as the assumption of\ndifference of characteristics and the assumption of ultimate differences\npresuppose each other.\n\np. 73\n\n[paragraph continues] Should you adduce as parallel instances the all-\npervadingness of ether, &c. (the '&c.' implying place and time), we reply that\ntheir all-pervadingness is not proved for him who holds the doctrine of\nBrahman and looks upon ether and so on as mere effects.\n\nAll which establishes the conclusion that the only doctrine not open to any\nobjections is the doctrine of the unity of the Self.\n\np. 74\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[72:1](sbe38054.htm#fr_48) And this is an attack on the basis of the position\nof the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khyas as well as of the Vai _s_ eshikas.\n\n[72:2](sbe38054.htm#fr_49) Which being equally omnipresent would all occupy\nthe same space.\n\n[72:3](sbe38054.htm#fr_50) Many attributes such as colour, smell, touch, &c.\nreside in one place as belonging to one material object.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 1](sbe38055.htm)\n\n"
