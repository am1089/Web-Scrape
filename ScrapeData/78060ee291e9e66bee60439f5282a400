In both cases also (in the cases of the ad _ri_ sh _t_ a inhering either\nin the atoms or the soul) action (of the atoms) is not (possible); hence\nabsence of that (viz. creation and pralaya).\n\nThe Sutrakara now proceeds to refute the doctrine of atoms being the cause of\nthe world.--This doctrine arises in the following manner. We see that all\nordinary substances which consist of parts as, for instance, pieces of cloth\noriginate from the substances connected with them by the relation of\ninherence, as for instance threads, conjunction co-operating (with the parts\nto form the whole). We thence draw the general conclusion that whatever\nconsists of parts has originated from those substances with which it is\nconnected by the relation of inherence, conjunction cooperating. That thing\nnow at which the distinction of whole and parts stops and which marks the\nlimit of division into minuter parts is the atom.--This whole world, with its\nmountains, oceans, and so on, is composed of parts; because it is composed of\nparts it has a beginning and an end  1; an effect may not be assumed without a\ncause; therefore the atoms are the cause of the world. Such is Ka _n_ ada's\ndoctrine.--As we observe four elementary substances consisting of parts, viz.\nearth, water, fire, and air (wind), we have to assume four different kinds of\natoms. These atoms marking the limit of subdivision into minuter parts cannot\n\np. 387\n\nbe divided themselves; hence when the elements are destroyed they can be\ndivided down to atoms only; this state of atomic division of the elements\nconstitutes the pralaya (the periodical destruction of the world). After that\nwhen the time for creation comes, motion (karman) springs up in the aerial\natoms. This motion which is due to the unseen principle  1 joins the atom in\nwhich it resides to another atom; thus binary compounds, &c. are produced, and\nfinally the element of air. In a like manner are produced fire, water, earth,\nthe body with its organs. Thus the whole world originates from atoms. From the\nqualities inhering in the atoms the qualities belonging to the binary\ncompounds are produced, just as the qualities of the cloth result from the\nqualities of the threads.--Such, in short, is the teaching of the followers of\nKa _n_ ada.\n\nThis doctrine we controvert in the following manner.--It must be admitted that\nthe atoms when they are in a state of isolation require action (motion) to\nbring about their conjunction; for we observe that the conjunction of threads\nand the like is effected by action. Action again, which is itself an effect,\nrequires some operative cause by which it is brought about; for unless some\nsuch cause exists, no original motion can take place in the atoms. If, then,\nsome operative cause is assumed, we may, in the first place, assume some cause\nanalogous to seen causes, such as endeavour or impact. But in that case\noriginal motion could not occur at all in the atoms, since causes of that kind\nare, at the time, impossible. For in the pralaya state endeavour, which is a\nquality of the soul, cannot take place because no body exists then. For the\nquality of the soul called endeavour originates when the soul is connected\nwith the internal organ which abides in the body. The same reason precludes\nthe assumption of other seen causes such as impact and the like. For they all\nare possible only after the creation of the world has taken place, and cannot\ntherefore be the\n\np. 388\n\ncauses of the original action (by which the world is produced).--If, in the\nsecond place, the unseen principle is assumed as the cause of the original\nmotion of the atoms, we ask: Is this unseen principle to be considered as\ninhering in the soul or in the atom? In both cases it cannot be the cause of\nmotion in the atoms, because it is non-intelligent. For, as we have shown\nabove in our examination of the Sa _n_ khya system, a non-intelligent thing\nwhich is not directed by an intelligent principle cannot of itself either act\nor be the cause of action, and the soul cannot be the guiding principle of the\nad _ri_ sh _t_ a because at the time of pralaya its intelligence has not yet\narisen  1. If, on the other hand, the unseen principle is supposed to inhere\nin the soul, it cannot be the cause of motion in the atoms, because there\nexists no connexion of it with the latter. If you say that the soul in which\nthe unseen principle inheres is connected with the atoms, then there would\nresult, from the continuity of connexion  2, continuity of action, as there is\nno other restricting principle.--Hence, there being no definite cause of\naction, original action cannot take place in the atoms; there being no action,\nconjunction of the atoms which depends on action cannot take place; there\nbeing no conjunction, all the effects depending on it, viz. the formation of\nbinary atomic compounds, &c., cannot originate.\n\nHow, moreover, is the conjunction of one atom with another to be imagined? Is\nit to be total interpenetration of the two or partial conjunction? If the\nformer, then no increase of bulk could take place, and consequently atomic\nsize only would exist; moreover, it would be contrary to what is observed, as\nwe see that conjunction takes place between substances having parts (prade _s_\na). If the latter, it would follow that the atoms are composed of parts.--Let\nthen the atoms be imagined to consist of parts.--If so, imagined things being\nunreal, the conjunction also of the atoms would be unreal and thus could not\nbe the noninherent\n\np. 389\n\ncause of real things. And without non-inherent causes effected substances such\nas binary compounds, &c. could not originate. And just as at the time of the\nfirst creation motion of the atoms leading to their conjunction could not take\nplace, there being no cause of such motion; thus at the time of a general\npralaya also no action could take place leading to their separation, since for\nthat occurrence also no definite seen cause could be alleged. Nor could the\nunseen principle be adduced as the cause, since its purport is to effect\nenjoyment (of reward and punishment on the part of the soul), not to bring\nabout the pralaya. There being then no possibility of action to effect either\nthe conjunction or the separation of the atoms, neither conjunction nor\nseparation would actually take place, and hence neither creation nor pralaya\nof the world.--For these reasons the doctrine of the atoms being the cause of\nthe world must be rejected.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[386:1](sbe34188.htm#fr_364) Like other things, let us say a piece of cloth,\nwhich consists of parts.\n\n[387:1](sbe34188.htm#fr_365) Or, more particularly, to the conjunction of the\natoms with the souls to which merit and demerit belong.--Ad _ri_ sh _t_\napeksham ad _ri_ sh _t_ avatkshetra _g \xc3\xb1_asa _my_ ogapeksham iti yavat. \xc3\x83n.\nGi.\n\n[388:1](sbe34188.htm#fr_366) According to the Vai _s_ eshikas intelligence is\nnot essential to the soul, but a mere adventitious quality arising only when\nthe soul is joined to an internal organ.\n\n[388:2](sbe34188.htm#fr_367) The soul being all-pervading.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 13](sbe34189.htm)\n\n"
