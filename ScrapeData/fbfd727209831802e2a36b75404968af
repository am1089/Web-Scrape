Relation of Universal to Individual Soul.--It is a first principle of\nthe Upanishads that the numberless individual souls are really one with the\nUniversal Self. But how is this relation conceivable? To this question no\nanswer is vouchsafed. The older texts instead give us\n\np. 41\n\ncosmogonic myths, which realistically depict a Universal Spirit creating the\nphenomenal world and then animating it as world-soul; and the latter they\nsimply identify with the self of the individual, sometimes more\npantheistically (Ch. VI. iii.), sometimes more idealistically (B.A.II. iv. 5,\nIII. iv. 1, v. 1, etc.). But why should there be this division between the one\nAbsolute Soul and the innumerable individual souls condemned to suffer the\nintellectual darkness and physical sorrows of embodied life? The Upanishads\nfind a solution in their theory of _karma,_ the acts done in previous births\nrequiring further embodiment to work away their influence upon the soul. This\nimplies a _regressus ad infinitum,_ as every act is the resultant of a former\nact; and this conclusion is cheerfully drawn by the later Ved\xc4\x81nta, which thus\navoids the necessity of explaining the "origin of evil." The older Upanishads,\nwhose cosmogonies contradict this theory, simply avoid the question.\n\nThe theory which begins to appear in a somewhat late Upanishad (the\nMaitr\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xabya), that the Soul conceives division and plurality in consequence\nof the delusive attractions of physical Nature, and hence assumes embodied\nform and comes under the influence of "works," is partly connected with the\ndualism of the S\xc4\x81nkhya school, and partly with the theory of "illusion"\ndeveloped in the later Ved\xc4\x81nta (see \xc2\xa7 16). \xc5\x9aankara generally regards the\nuniverse itself, i.e. the\n\np. 42\n\naggregate of subjects and objects of experience, as created in order to\nfurnish finite souls with experiences in recompense of previous "works"; but\nthe reason moving the Supreme Brahma to render himself an efficient and\nmaterial cause of a universe distinct from himself, says \xc5\x9aankara, can only be\nmotiveless _sport_ (see commentary on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra, II. i. 33).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Organism of Soul](brk21.htm)\n\n'
