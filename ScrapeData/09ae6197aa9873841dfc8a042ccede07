Suta said :-- \xc2\x93O Munis! seeing now the king lifeless, and his son a mere\nboy, the ministers themselves performed all his funeral ceremonies. First they\nburned the king on the banks of the Ganges without uttering any Mantra, as his\ndeath was an accidental one due to snake bite, afterwards they had an effigy\nof the king made of kus\xc2\x92a grass and placed it on a funeral pyre and burned it,\nwith sandal and scented wood. The priest then performed and completed his\nfuneral obsequies, repeating duly the Vedic mantras, and distributed various\nthings in charities to the Brahmi _n_ s, together with sufficient quantity of\ngold, and varieties of food and clothings so that the king may attain heaven.\n\n\n\n5-7. Next, on an auspicious moment, the ministers installed the boy prince on\nthe throne that gladdened the hearts of the subjects and all the popu-\n\n\n\np. 112\n\n\n\nlace of the city, towns, and villages acknowledged the boy prince Janamejaya,\nendowed with all royal qualities as their king. The Dhatreyi gave all\ninstructions to the king about his duties. The boy prince gradually grew in\nyears and became endowed with great intellect.\n\n\n\n8-15. When Janamejaya became eleven years old, the family priest initiated him\nduly with the Gayatri mantra and he also studied it duly. Then Kripa charya\ntaught him perfectly the science of archery (Dhanurveda) as Dronacharya taught\nArju _n_ a and Paras'urama taught Kar _n_ a. Janamejaya learnt by and by all\nthe sciences and became very powerful and indomitable to his enemies as he was\nskilled in the science of archery, he was similarly in the other branches of\nthe Vedas. Truthful, self-controlled, religious, the king Janamejaya acquired\nfull knowledge in the Dharmas'astras (philosophies and law books) and\nArthas'astras (economics) and governed his kingdom like the Dharma's son Yudhi\n_st_ hira.\n\n\n\nThe king of Kas'i gave his all-auspicious daughter Vapu _st_ ama in marriage\nto the king Janamejaya wearing golden coat of armour. The king Janamejaya,\nwith the beautiful Vapus'ama casting side-long looks, looked very happy as was\nthe king Vichitravirya, when he got for his wife the daughter of Kashiraj and\nalso when Arjuna got his Subhadra. Then the king began to enjoy his lotus-eyed\nVapustama in forest, and gardens like S\xc2\x92atakratu and S\xc2\x92achi. The able\nministers conducted satisfactorily the reins of government; and the subjects,\nwell governed passed away their time with cheerful hearts.\n\n\n\n16-32. In the meanwhile, a Muni, named Uttanka, being much troubled by Tak _s_\naka, thought who could help him in his taking revenge on Tak _s_ ak and,\nseeing the king Pariksit's son the king Janamejaya a proper person came to\nHastina to the king and spoke out thus :-- \xc2\x93O good king! Thou dost not know\nwhen to do a thing that ought to be done; Thou art doing at present what ought\nnot to be done; and thou art not doing what should be done now. There is\nnothing of anger or energy within Thee; Thou dost things as a child does; so\nThou dost not know the meaning of the S\xc2\x92astras nor dost Thou know Thy former\nenemy; so what shall I pray before Thee?\xc2\x94 Hearing this Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O\nhighly fortunate one! I do not know who is my enemy; what wrong is there to be\nredressed? please speak out what I am to do.\xc2\x94 Uttanka said :-- \xc2\x93O king! the\nwicked Tak _s_ ak killed Thy father; ask about the death of Thy father from\nThy councillors.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words, the king Janamejaya asked his\nministers; they replied \xc2\x93Thy father died out of the snake Tak _s_ aka's bite.\xc2\x94\nThen the king spoke :-- \xc2\x93The cause of my father's death is the Brahmi _n_ 's\ncurse; what is the fault of Tak _s_ aka in this matter; please say.\xc2\x94 Uttanka\nsaid :-- It was Tak _s_ aka that\n\n\n\np. 113\n\n\n\ngave abundance of wealth to Kas'yapa who was coming to cure Thy father of Tak\n_s_ aka's poison and made him desist from his purpose; so O king! Is not that\nTak _s_ aka, then, Thy father's great enemy and his slayer?\n\n\n\nO King! In former days, when Pramadvara, the dearest wife of the Muni Ruru,\ndied of snake bite in her unmarried state, Ruru made her alive again. But Ruru\nmade then the promise \xc2\x93whichever serpent will see, I will take away __ its\nlife by striking it with a club.\xc2\x94 O King! Thus making the resolve, he began to\nkill snakes wherever he found with his club, and thus, in his course of travel\nall round the earth, he saw within a forest an aged terrible water-snake (Dho\n_nd_ a serpent) and immediately lifted his club to kill it and angrily struck\na blow on it, when the snake replied :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_ a! Why are you striking\nme thus? I have not caused any offence to you.\xc2\x94 Ruru said :-- \xc2\x93O serpent! My\ndearest wife died of snake bite; since then I have made this resolve, under\ngreat provocation and sorrow, to kill snakes.\xc2\x94 Hearing thus, the water-snake\nDu _nd_ ubha replied :-- \xc2\x93I do not bite; those who bite are a different class\nof snakes; simply on account of my bearing a body similar to them that you\nwill strike me is not quite proper.\xc2\x94 Hearing these beautiful humane words from\nthe mouth of a serpent, Ruru asked :-- \xc2\x93Who are you? Why have you become this\nDu _nd_ ubha snake?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n33-45. The snake replied :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_ a! I was formerly a Brahma _n_ ;\nthere was a friend of mine named Khyas, very religious, truthful and self-\ncontrolled. Once he was staying in his Agnihotra room and I foolishly\nterrified him much by placing before him an artificial snake created by me of\nthe leaves of trees. He became so much bewildered with fear and shuddered so\nterribly that he at length cursed me saying :-- \xc2\x93O one of blunt intellect! As\nyou have terrified me by this snake, having no poison, so you better be a\nsnake of that type.\xc2\x94 Immediately I turned into a snake and when I much\nentreated that Brahma _n_ a, his anger abated a little and he said again :--\n\xc2\x93O snake! Pramati's son Ruru will no doubt free you of this curse.\xc2\x94 I am that\nsnake; and you are also that Ruru; now hear my words in conformity with\nDharma. The highest Dharma of the Brahma _n_ a, is non-killing. There is no\ndoubt in this. The wise Brahma _n_ as ought to show mercy to all. No harm or\nkilling is to he committed anywhere except in Yaj\xc3\xb1a (sacrifice); killing is\nonly allowed in a Yaj\xc3\xb1a; for at the sacrifice, the animal killed attains the\nhighest goal; hence killing in sacrifice is not reckoned as an act of killing.\nUttanka said :-- That Brahma _n_ a was then freed of the serpent body; and\nRuru, too, desisted from killing since then. O King! Ruru gave life back to\nthat girl and married her but even then, remembering the former enmity he\nkilled the snakes. But, O chief of Bharata's family! Thou art staying without\n\n\n\np. 114\n\n\n\nany care, without any anger to the snakes and without any revenge to the\nprevious wrong. O king of kings! Thy father died high up in the air without\nany bath or charity due to be done at the time of death. So rescue thy father\nby killing his enemies, the snakes. That son is dead, though living, who does\nnot consider the act of his father's enemy as inimical. Until Thou dost kill\nthe snakes, Thy father's enemies, Thy father's hell life will not be freed. O\nking! Now remember the wrong done to Thy father and perform the sacrifice to\nthe Great Mother, denominated as the Sarpa Yaj\xc3\xb1a (the sacrifice of snakes).\n\n\n\n46-55. Suta said :-- Hearing the words of Uttanka, the king Janamejaya sadly\nwept and shed tears, and thought within himself :-- \xc2\x93Alas! Fie to me! I am a\ngreat stupid; hence I feel myself proud but in vain. Where can his honour be\nwhose father, bitten by a snake, has gone down to hell. Now I will, no doubt,\ncommence the Sarpa Yaj\xc3\xb1a and ensure the destruction of all the snakes in the\nblazing sacrificial fire and thus deliver my father from hell.\xc2\x94 Thus coming to\na conclusion, he called all his ministers and said :-- \xc2\x93O ministers! Better\nmake arrangements duly for a great sacrifice. Have a suitable holy site on the\nbanks of the Ganges, selected and measured by the Brahma _n_ as and have a\nbeautiful sacrificial hall built up on one hundred pillars and prepare a\nsacrificial altar within this. O Ministers! When all these preliminaries will\nbe completed, I will commence with great eclat the great Sarpa Yaj\xc3\xb1a\n(sacrifice of snakes). In that Yaj\xc3\xb1a, the snake Tak _s_ ak will be the animal\nvictim; and Uttanka, the great Muni, will be the sacrificial priest; so invite\nearly the all-knowing Brahma _n_ as, versed in the Vedas. Thus at the command\nof the king, the able ministers collected all the materials of the sacrifice\nand prepared a big sacrificial altar. When the oblations were offered on the\nsacrificial fire, calling on the snakes, Tak _s_ ak became greatly distressed\nwith fear and took refuge of Indra saying \xc2\x93Save my life\xc2\x94. Indra, then, gave\nhopes to Tak _s_ aka, trembling with fear, and made him sit on his \xc3\x82sana,\nencouraged him with words \xc2\x93No fear\xc2\x94. O! snake do not fear any more.\n\n\n\n56-65. The Muni Uttanka, seeing that Tak _s_ ak had taken Indra's protection\nand that Indra had given him hopes of \xc2\x93no fear\xc2\x94, called on Tak _s_ aka with\nIndra to come to fire with an anxious heart; Tak _s_ ak, then, seeing no other\nway, took refuge of the greatly religious \xc3\x82stik, the son of the Muni Jarat\nKaru, born of the family of Yayavara. The Muni's son \xc3\x82stik came to the\nsacrificial hall and chanted hymns in praise of Janamejaya; the king, too,\nseeing the Muni boy greatly learned worshipped him and said :-- \xc2\x93What for have\nyou come? I will give you what you desire.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, \xc3\x82stika prayed :-- \xc2\x93O\nhighly enlightened one! Let you desist from this sacrifice.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 115\n\n\n\nThe truthful king, prayed thus again and again, stopped the Sarpa Yaj\xc3\xb1a to\nkeep the Muni's word. Vais'ampayana then recited the whole Mahabharata to the\nking to cheer up his heart. But the king, hearing the whole Mahabharata could\nnot find peace and asked Veda Vyasa \xc2\x93how can I get peace; my mind is\nconstantly being burned with sorrow; say what am I to do? I am very miserable;\nhence my father Pariksit the son of Abhimanyu has died an unnatural death. O\nlucky one! See that a K _s_ attriya's death in a deadly battlefield or in an\nordinary battle is praiseworthy; even his death in his own house, if followed\nup according to natural laws and Vidhis (rules) is commendable; but my father\ndid not die such a death; under the Brahma _n_ a's curse why did he, quite\nsenseless, quit his life high up in the air? O son of Satyavati! Now advise me\nso that my father who is now in hell can again go up to the heavens, and that\nmy heart may find its way to peace.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus ends the Eleventh Chapter of the Second Skandha on the \xc2\x93Sarpa Yaj\xc3\xb1a\xc2\x94 in\nthe Mahapura _n_ a S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 12](bk02ch12.htm)\n\n"
