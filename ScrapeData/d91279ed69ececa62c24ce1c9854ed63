He called\nhimself Basoodeo Pounrik, and caused himself to be worshipped by all men;\nwhatsoever Raja did not obey his order, he attacked him; and, having fought,\nreduced him to subjection.\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja!\nseeing and hearing of his practices, people began to say in every country,\ncity, village and house, "One Basoodeo has appeared in the country of Bruj, in\nthe family of Judoo, and he dwells in the city of Dwarka, another has now come\nto Kasee, which of the two shall we look upon and respect as the true one?"\nSuch was the talk in every country; when, having made some discovery, Basoodeo\nPounrik\n\np. 337\n\ncame one day into his own court, and said, "Who is Krishnu that lives at\nDwarka, whom the world calls Basoodeo? He has come upon the earth for the sake\nof his worshippers, and has there assumed an appearance like mine." Having\nthus spoken, he sent for a messenger; and, entering into very minute\nexplanations with him, despatched him to Dwarka to Shree Krishnu Chund Jee,\nsaying, "Tell all persons, who are wandering about in an appearance like mine,\nto relinquish that appearance and if they do not relinquish it, prepare to\nfight with them." On receiving the order the messenger, taking leave, started\nfrom Kasee, and arrived at the city of Dwarka; and appeared in the court of\nShree Krishnu Chund Jee. Krishnu asked him, "Who he was, and whence he had\ncome?" He replied, "I am a messenger of Raja Pounrik, of the city of Kasee, I\nam come to deliver a message to you from my master, which, with your\npermission, I will mention." Shree Krishnu Chund granted permission. When he\nhad done so, the messenger standing up with joined hands, began to say, "O\ngreat king! Basoodeo Pounrik says, \'That he is lord of the three worlds and\ncreator of the universe, and asks who you are, who having assumed his\nappearance, and fled from fear of Joorasindhoo, have come to live at Dwarka;\nyou must either immediately give over imitating him in outward appearance and\nseek his protection; or he will come and destroy you, together with all the\ndescendants of Judoo; and, having removed the burthens of the earth, will\ncherish his own worshippers, I am Pounrik, the unseen, the invisible, the\nwithout form; gods, sages, saints and men offer prayers, penance, sacrifice\nand gifts continually to me. I, as Bruhmu, am the creator, as Vishnu, the\npreserver, and as Shivu, the destroyer. In the form of a fish I rescued the\nsinking Vedas, in the form of a tortoise I supported a hill, as a boar I\nupheld the earth, descending upon the earth as half man and half lion, I\ndestroyed the demon Hirunkusyp, in the incarnation\n\np. 338\n\nof a dwarf, I deceived Bull, when I descended as Ram, I destroyed the great\ndevil, Rawun. This is my occupation, that, whenever demons vex my worshippers,\nI descend upon the earth, and remove its burthens.\'"\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O great king! the messenger of Basoodeo Pounrik was thus speaking,\nand Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy, seated on a jewelled throne amidst\nan assemblage of Judoos was listening and laughing, when one of the\ndescendants of Judoo exclaimed, "Has the regent of the dead come to take thee\naway, that thou speakest thus; we will kill thee, thou low wretch! Thou hast\ncome as the go-between of a deceitful man; if you were not an ambassador, we\nwould certainly put you to death, it is not right to kill a messenger."\n\nO great king! when the descendants of Judoo had thus spoken, Shree Krishnu\nJee, having called that messenger, explained to him and said, "Go and tell thy\nBasoodeo, that Krishnu says, that he is about to give up imitating thy\nappearance, and to seek an asylum with thee, be prepared."\n\nOn hearing these words the messenger made a salutation, and took leave; and\nShree Krishnu Chund Jee also set out with his army for the city of Kasee. The\nmessenger went and said to Basoodeo Pounrik, "O great king! I have been to\nDwarka, and delivered the whole of the message you charged me with to Shree\nKrishnu; and on hearing it he said, \'Go and tell thy master to be prepared, as\nI am about to give up imitating his appearance, and to seek an asylum with\nhim.\'"\n\nO great king! whilst the ambassador was still speaking, some one came and\nsaid, "O great king! why are you sitting thus unconcerned? Shree Krishnu has\nadvanced with his army." In hearing this, Basoodeo Pounrik came forth with his\nwhole army in his assumed appearance; and, proceeding onwards, came in front\nof Shree Krishnu Chund Jee. Another\n\np. 339\n\n[paragraph continues] Raja of Kasee came also with him; on both sides the\narmies were arranged in battle order: the warlike instruments began to sound,\nthe brave, the resolute and the heroical began to fight; and cowards, leaving\nthe field, to run for their lives; at that time Basoodeo Pounrik continuing to\nfight and being in the hands of death, went in his assumed form in front of\nShree Krishnu Chund Jee, and challenged him. On seeing him in that counterfeit\ndress, the descendants of Judoo said to Shree Krishnu Chund, "O great king!\nhow shall we kill him in this likeness?" Krishnu said, "It is no crime to kill\na deceitful man in that likeness."\n\nHaving thus spoken, Huri gave the order to the quoit, Soodursun, who went and\nplucked out his two wooden arms; the wooden sovereign of the feathered race\nwas broken at the same time, and the horse ran away; when Basoodeo Pounrik\nfell Soodursun cut off his head, and threw it away. On his head being cut off\nthe Raja Pounrik was released from existence; his head fell in the city of\nKasee, where his seraglio was, and his wives saw it; they wept and tore their\nhair, saying, "Who was the author of this deed? You were not subject to\ndecrepitude and were immortal. How has your soul departed in a second?"\n\nO great king! on hearing the lamentations of the Raja\'s wives, a son of his,\nnamed Soodukoch, came there, and seeing his father\'s head, which had been cut\noff, was greatly enraged and began to say, "I will not rest without revenging\nmyself on him who has slain my father."\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee, said,--O great\nking! having destroyed Basoodeo Pounrik, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee returned with\nall his army to Dwarka, and the Raja\'s son, with a view of revenging his\nfather\'s death, began to perform a very difficult penance to Muhadeo Jee. When\nhe had been engaged some days in this penance, Muhadeo Bholanath came one day\nhighly delighted, and said, "Ask a boon from me." The Raja\'s son said, "O\ngreat king! grant me this boon, that I may be revenged on\n\np. 340\n\n[paragraph continues] Shree Krishnu for my father\'s death." Shivu Jee replied,\n"Very good, if you desire revenge, adopt this plan." He said, "What plan?"\nShivu replied, "Offer a sacrifice, repeating the incantations of the Vedas\nbackwards, a female devil will come forth from the fire, who will do whatever\nyou tell her." When Shivu Jee had thus spoken, the Raja\'s son, O great king!\nsent for brahmins, and having built an altar, and taking sesamum, ghee,\nbarley, sugar and other requisites for the sacrifice and mixing them up\ntogether, began to offer sacrifice, repeating the incantations of the Vedas\nbackwards. At length, whilst he was engaged in the sacrifice, a female devil,\nnamed Kritya, came forth from the hole, in which the consecrated fire was\nreceived, who, burning all the cities and villages, and the whole country in\nrear of Shree Krishnu Jee, arrived at the city of Dwarka, and began to set the\ncity on fire. Seeing the city in flames, all the descendants of Judoo went in\nconsternation to Shree Krishnu. Chund Jee, and called out, "O great king! how\nshall we escape from this fire, it is burning down the whole city?" Krishnu.\nreplied, "Be not at all alarmed, this is a female devil, named Kritya, who has\ncome from Kasee, I will immediately make arrangements with regard to her."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, Shree Krishnu. Jee gave the order to the\nquoit, Soodursun, to attack and put her to flight, and to go at once, and set\nfire to the city of Kasee. On receiving Huri\'s order, the quoit, Soodursun,\nput to flight and destroyed Kritya, and went forthwith, and set Kasee on fire,\nThe inhabitants fled from place to place in great distress; and bitterly\nabused Soodukoch. The quoit returned, after having fired the city, and came,\nand told Krishnu.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXVIII](psa69.htm)\n\n'
