Near he drew  \nWith hands upraised in reverence due.  \nWith blessing first his king he hailed;  \nThen with a voice that well-nigh failed,  \nIn trembling accents soft and low  \nAddressed the monarch in his woe:  \n'The prince of men, thy Rama, waits  \nBefore thee at the palace gates.  \nHis wealth to Brahmans he has dealt,  \nAnd all whom in his home have dwelt.  \nAdmit thy son. His friends have heard  \nHis kind farewell and parting word,  \nHe longs to see thee first, and then  \nWill seek the wilds, O King of men.  \nHe, with each princely virtue's blaze,  \nShines as the sun engirt by rays.'  \n\nThe truthful King who loved to keep  \nThe law profound as Ocean's deep,  \nAnd stainless as the dark blue sky,  \nThus to Sumantra made reply:  \n\np. 135  \n\n'Go then, Sumantra, go and call  \nMy wives and ladies one and all.  \nDrawn round me shall they fill the place  \nWhen I behold my Rama's face.'  \n\n   Quick to the inner rooms he sped,  \nAnd thus to all the women said,  \n'Come, at the summons of the king:  \nCome all, and make no tarrying.'  \n\n   Their husband's word, by him conveyed,  \nSoon as they heard, the dames obeyed,  \nAnd following his guidance all  \nCame thronging to the regal hall.  \nln number half seven hundred, they,  \nAll lovely dames, in long array,  \nWith their bright eyes for weeping red,  \nTo stand round Queen Kaus'alya, sped.  \nThey gathered, and the monarch viewed  \nOne moment all the multitude,  \nThen to Sumantra spoke and said:  \n'Now let my son be hither led.'  \n\n   Sumantra went. Then Rama came,  \nAnd Lakshman, and the Maithil dame,  \nAnd, as he led them on, their guide  \nStraight to the monarch's presence hied.  \nWhen yet far off the father saw  \nHis son with raised palms toward him draw,  \nGirt by his ladies, sick with woes,  \nSwift from his royal seat he rose.  \nWith all his strength the aged man  \nTo meet his darling Rama ran,  \nBut trembling, wild with dark despair,  \nFell on the ground and fainted there.  \nAnd Lakshman, wont in cars to ride,  \nAnd Rama, threw them by the side  \nOf the poor miserable king,  \nHalf lifeless with his sorrow's sting.  \nThroughout the spacious hall up went  \nA thousand women's wild lament:  \n'Ah Rama!' thus they wailed and wept,  \nAnd anklets tinkled as they stepped.  \nAround his body, weeping, threw  \nTheir loving arms the brothers two,  \nAnd then, with Sita's gentle aid,  \nThe king upon a couch was laid.  \nAt length to earth's imperial lord,  \nWhen life and knowledge were restored,  \nThough seas of woe went o'er his head,  \nWith suppliant hand, thus Rama said:  \n'Lord ot us all, great King, thou art:  \nBid me farewell before we part,  \nTo Dandak wood this day I go:  \nOne blessing and one look bestow.  \nLet Lakshman my companion be,  \nAnd Sita also follow me.  \nWith truthful pleas I sought to bend  \nTheir purpose; but no ear they lend.  \nNow cast this sorrow from thy heart,  \nAnd let us all, great King, depart.  \nAs Brahma sends his children, so  \nLet Lakshman, me, and Sita go.'  \n\nHe stood unmoved, and watched intent  \nUntil the king should grant consent.  \nUpon his son his eyes he cast,  \nAnd thus the monarch spake at last:  \n'O Rama, by her arts enslaved,  \nI gave the boons Kaikeyi craved,  \nUnfit to reign, by her misled:  \nBe ruler in thy father's stead.'  \n\nThus by the lord of men addressed,  \nRama, of virtue's friends the best,  \nIn lore of language duly learned,  \nHis answer, reverent, thus returned:  \n'A thousand years, O King, remain  \nO'er this our city still to reign.  \nI in the woods my life will lead:  \nThe lust of rule no more I heed.  \nNine years and five I there will spend,  \nAnd when the portioned days shall end,  \nWill come, my vows and exile o'er,  \nAnd clasp thy feet, my King, once more.'  \n\nA captive in the snare of truth,  \nWeeping, distressed with woe and ruth,  \nThus spake the monarch, while the queen  \nKaikeyi urged him on unseen:  \n'Go then, O Rama, and begin  \nThy course unvext by fear and sin:  \nGo, my beloved son, and earn  \nSuccess, and joy, and safe return.  \nSo fast the bonds of duty bind.  \nO Raghu's son, thy truthful mind,  \nThat naught can turn thee back, or guide  \nThy will so strongly fortified.  \nBut 0, a little longer stay.  \nNor turn thy steps this night away,  \nThat I one little day--alas!  \nOne only--with my son may pass.  \nMe and thy mother do not slight,  \nBut stay, my son, with me to-night;  \nWith every dainty please thy taste,  \nAnd seek to-morrow morn the waste  \nHard is thy task, O Raghu's son,  \nDire is the toil thou wilt not shun,  \nFar to the lonely wood to flee,  \nAnd leave thy friends for love of me.  \nI swear it by my truth, believe,  \nFor thee, my son, I deeply grieve,  \nMisguided by the traitress dame  \nWith hidden guile like smouldering flame.  \nNow, by her wicked counsel stirred,  \nThou fain wouldst keep my plighted word.  \nNo marvel that my eldest born  \nWould hold me true when I have sworn.'  \n\nThen Rama having calmly heard  \nHis wretched father speak each word,  \nWith Lakshman standing br his side  \nThus, humbly, to the King replied:  \n'If dainties now my taste regale,  \nTo-morrow must those dainties fail.  \nThis day departure I prefer  \nTo all that wealth can minister.  \nO'er this fair land, no longer mine,  \nWhich I, with all her realms, resign,  \n\np. 136  \n\nHer multitudes of men, her grain,  \nHer stores of wealth, let Bharat reign.  \nAnd let the promised boon which thou  \nWast pleased to grant the queen ere now,  \nBe hers in full. Be true, O King,  \nKind giver of each precious thing.  \nThy spoken word I still will heed,  \nObeying all thy lips decreed:  \nAnd fourteen years in woods will dwell  \nWith those who live in glade and dell.  \nNo hopes of power my heart can touch,  \nNo selfish joys attract so much  \nAs son of Raghu, to fulfil  \nWith heart and soul my father's will.  \nDismiss, dismiss thy needless woe,  \nNor let those drowning torrents flow:  \nThe Lord of Rivers in his pride  \nKeeps to the banks that bar his tide.  \nHere in thy presence I declare;  \nBy thy good deeds, thy truth, I swear;  \nNor lordship, joy, nor lands I prize;  \nLife, heaven, all blessings I despise.  \nI wish to see thee still remain  \nMost true, O King, and free from stain.  \nIt must not, Sire, it must not be:  \nI cannot rest one hour with thee.  \nThen bring this sorrow to an end,  \nFor naught my settled will can bend.  \nI gave a pledge that binds me too,  \nAnd to that pledge I still am true.  \nKaikeyi bade me speed away:  \nShe prayed me, and I answered yea.  \nPine not for me, and weep no more;  \nThe wood for us has joy in store,  \nFilled with the wild deer's peaceful herds  \nAnd voices of a thousand birds.  \nA father is the God of each,  \nYea, e'en of Gods, so Scriptures teach:  \nAnd I will keep my sire's decree,  \nFor as a God I honour thee.  \nO best of men, the time is nigh,  \nThe fourteen years will soon pass by  \nAnd to thine eyes thy son restore:  \nBe comforted, and weep no more.  \nThou with thy firmness shouldst support  \nThese weeping crowds who throng the court;  \nThen why, O chief of high renown,  \nSo troubled, and thy soul cast down?'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXV.: Kaikeyi Reproached.](ry113.htm)\n\n"
