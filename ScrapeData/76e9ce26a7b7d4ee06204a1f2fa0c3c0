When he performs a twelve days' sacrifice with transposed metres\n(Dvada _s_ aha vyu _dh_ a _kh_ andas), then he (the Adhvaryu) transposes the\ngrahas (cups of Soma); and both the Udgat _ri_ and the Hot _ri_ transpose the\nmetres. Now there is first that normal Tryaha (triduum), with settled metres\n1: there he draws the cup beginning with the Aindravayava.\n\np. 419\n\n4:5:9:22\\. Then, on the fourth day, he transposes the grahas, and they\ntranspose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a,\n--for that fourth day is Pra _g_ apati's own; and the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a is the\nself, and Pra _g_ apati is the self: therefore he draws the cups beginning\nwith the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a.\n\n4:5:9:33\\. Having drawn that (\xc3\x82graya _n_ a) cup, he does not deposit it--the\ngrahas being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs 1; for he\nwould indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near\nholding that (cup) 2; and (the Adhvaryu) draws (the other) cups; and while he\ndraws the cups, then whenever the time of that cup (in the order of\nperformance comes), he utters 'Hi _m_ ' and deposits it. Then follows that\nnormal 3 fifth day; on that he draws the cups beginning with the Aindravayava.\n\n4:5:9:44\\. Thereupon, on the sixth day, he transposes the grahas, and they\ntranspose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the _S_ ukra; for\nthat sixth day is Indra's own, and the _S_ ukra (bright, clear) is he that\nburns yonder, and he (the sun) indeed is Indra: therefore he draws the cups\nbeginning with the _S_ ukra.\n\n4:5:9:55\\. Having drawn that (cup), he does not deposit it--the grahas being\nthe vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed\ndisorder the vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near\n\np. 420\n\nholding that (cup); and he draws (the other) cups; and while he draws the\ncups, then whenever the time of that (cup comes), he deposits it.\n\n4:5:9:66\\. Then, on the seventh day, he transposes the grahas, and they\ntranspose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the _S_ ukra cup;\nfor that seventh day belongs to the B _ri_ hati ('great' metre); for the _S_\nukra is he that burns yonder, and he indeed is great: therefore he draws the\ncups beginning with the _S_ ukra.\n\n4:5:9:77\\. Having drawn that (cup), he does not deposit it--the grahas being\nthe vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed\ndisorder the vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near holding that\n(cup); and he draws the (other) cups; and while he draws the cups, then\nwhenever the time of that (cup comes), he deposits it. Then follows that\nnormal eighth day: there he draws the cups beginning with the Aindravayava.\n\n4:5:9:88\\. Then, on the ninth day, he transposes the grahas, and they\ntranspose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a;\nfor that ninth day belongs to the _G_ agati (metre), and the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a is\nthe self, and the self (soul) is this whole world ( _g_ agat): therefore he\ndraws the cups beginning with the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a.\n\n4:5:9:99\\. Having drawn it, he does not deposit it--the grahas being the vital\nairs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed disorder the\nvital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near holding that (cup); and he\ndraws the (other) cups; and while he draws the cups, when the time of that\n(cup comes), he utters 'Hi _m_ ' and deposits it.\n\n4:5:9:1010\\. Now they say, He should not transpose the\n\np. 421\n\ncups--the cups being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs;\nfor he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to transpose them:\ntherefore he should not transpose (the cups).\n\n4:5:9:1111\\. But let him, nevertheless, transpose them; for the cups are the\nlimbs, and in sleeping one likes to turn 1 his limbs from one side to the\nother: therefore let him nevertheless transpose them.\n\n4:5:9:1212\\. Nevertheless, he should not transpose them--the cups being the\nvital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed\ndisorder the vital airs, were he to transpose (the cups): therefore let him\nnot transpose them.\n\n4:5:9:1313\\. What, then, is the Adhvaryu to do in that case, when both the\nUdgat _ri_ and Hot _ri_ transpose (change) the metres 2? In that, at the\nmorning pressing, he draws first the Aindravayava cup; and at the midday\npressing the _S_ ukra cup; and at the evening pressing the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a cup,--\nthereby forsooth the Adhvaryu transposes (the cups).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[418:1](sbe2668.htm#fr_976) That is, three days, on which the order of the\nAgnish _t_ oma is observed. Hence, having drawn the Upa _m_ _s_ u and\nAntaryama cups ([IV, 1, 1](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1) and [2](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2)),\nwhich must always be drawn first, he draws the Aindravayava cup ([IV, 1,\n3](sbe2642.htm#4:1:3)) and so on. The same order is preserved on the fifth,\neighth, and last three days. On the fourth and ninth days, on the other hand,\nhe follows up the Upa _m_ _s_ u and Antaryama by the grahas of the third\npressing, beginning with the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a ([IV, 3, 5,\n21](sbe2654.htm#4:3:5:21) seq.); these being then succeeded by those of the\nmorning and midday pressings; and on the sixth and seventh days the Upa _m_\n_s_ u and Antaryama cups are succeeded by the grahas of the midday pressing,\nbeginning with the _S_ ukra cup ([IV, 3, 3, 2](sbe2652.htm#4:3:3:2)). This\nchange of the proper order of performance, of course, involves a different\narrangement of the stotras and _s_ astras (or 'the metres,' as they are called\nin the texts). This dislocation of the three pressings is afterwards to be\nrectified by the various cups being 'deposited' on the khara in their normal\norder. In the [last two paragraphs](sbe2668.htm#4:5:9:12) of the present\nBrahma _n_ a the author, however, p. 419 discountenances this practice of\nchanging the natural order of drawing the cups.\n\n[419:1](sbe2668.htm#fr_977) For this construction see [p.\n15](sbe2605.htm#page_15), note [3](sbe2605.htm#fn_55).\n\n[419:2](sbe2668.htm#fr_978) 'Having given it to some one else (to hold), he\ndraws the other cups.' Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[419:3](sbe2668.htm#fr_979) Or, that 'known' fifth day, i.e. performed in the\nmanner known, or explained before (viz. at the Agnish _t_ oma).\n\n[421:1](sbe2668.htm#fr_980) In the text our subordinate clause is, as usual,\nthe principal clause: 'one sleeps in turning his limbs from one side to the\nother.'\n\n[421:2](sbe2668.htm#fr_981) The chanters and the Hot _ri_ in any case use\ndifferent metres, as the principal ones, at different pressings.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV. 5, 10.
