When the gods had performed the guest-offering, discord befell\nthem. They separated into four different parties, unwilling to yield to each\nother's excellence,--Agni, with the Vasus, Soma with the Rudras, Varu _n_ a\nwith the \xc3\x82dityas, and Indra with the Maruts. B _ri_ haspati with the All-gods,\nsay some 2, but, indeed, those who separated into four parties were 'all the\ngods.' When they were separated, the Asura-Rakshas came after them and entered\nbetween them.\n\n3:4:2:22\\. They became aware of it,--'Forsooth, we are in an evil plight, the\nAsura-Rakshas have come in between us: we shall fall a prey to our enemies.\nLet us come to an agreement and yield to the excellence of one of us!' They\nyielded to the excellence of Indra; wherefore it is said, 'Indra is all the\ndeities, the gods have Indra for their chief.'\n\n3:4:2:33\\. For this reason let not kinsmen fall out, for any (enemy) of\ntheirs, be he ever so far away, steps in between them; they do what pleases\ntheir enemies and fall a prey to their enemies: therefore let them not fall\nout. For he who, knowing this, quarrels not, does what displeases his enemies\nand\n\np. 94\n\nfalls not a prey to his enemies: let him therefore not quarrel.\n\n3:4:2:44\\. They said, 'Well then, let us contrive so that this (concord) of\nours shall be for ever imperishable!'\n\n3:4:2:55\\. The gods laid down together 1 their favourite forms and desirable\npowers 2, one after another, and said, 'Thereby he shall be away from us, he\nshall be scattered to the winds, whosoever shall transgress this (covenant) of\nours!'--'Whose (is it) as witness 3?'--'Tanunapat, the mighty!'--Now the\nmighty Tanunapat indeed is yonder blowing (wind), he is the witness of living\nbeings, entering thus as the in-breathing and out-breathing.\n\n3:4:2:66\\. Wherefore they say, 'The gods know the mind of man.' In his mind he\nproposes; it passes on to the breath, and the breath to the wind, and the wind\ntells the gods what the mind of man is.\n\n3:4:2:77\\. Hence it was in regard to this what was said by the _Ri_ shi, 'In\nhis mind he proposeth, and it goeth on to the wind 4; and the wind telleth the\ngods what thy mind is, O man.'\n\n3:4:2:88\\. The gods laid down together their favourite forms and desirable\npowers, and said, 'Thereby he shall be away from us, he shall be scattered to\nthe winds, whosoever shall transgress this (covenant) of ours!' And even now\nthe gods do not transgress that (covenant), for how would they fare, were they\n\np. 95\n\nto transgress it?--they would speak untruth, and verily there is one law which\nthe gods do keep, namely, the truth. It is through this that their conquest,\ntheir glory is unassailable: and so, forsooth, is his conquest, his glory\nunassailable whosoever, knowing this, speaks the truth. Now, the Tanunaptra is\nreally that same (covenant of the gods).\n\n3:4:2:99\\. The gods laid down together their favourite forms and desirable\npowers. Now it is by taking portions of butter that they (the priests) lay\ndown together the desirable forms and favourite powers. Let him, then, not\ncovenant with any one and every one, lest his favourite forms and desirable\npowers should be mixed up (with those of others). But let him not deceive one\nwith whom he makes a covenant; for thus it is said, 'Let there be no deceiving\nof him with whom one has made the covenant of Tanunapat.'\n\n3:4:2:1010\\. In the first place he takes (butter) therefrom 1, with the text\n(Va _g_. S. V, 5), 'For him that rushes onward, for him that rushes about, I\ntake thee.' He that blows yonder (the wind) does indeed rush onward and rush\nabout; and it is for him that he takes (the butter): therefore he says, 'for\nhim that rushes onward, for him that rushes about, I take thee.'\n\n3:4:2:1111\\. 'For Tanunapat, the mighty.' The mighty Tanunapat truly is yonder\nblowing (wind), and it is for him that he takes (the butter): therefore he\nsays, 'For Tanunapat, the mighty.'\n\np. 96\n\n3:4:2:1212\\. 'For the powerful, the most strong!' He is indeed powerful and\nmost strong; and for him he takes it: therefore he says, 'For the powerful,\nthe most strong.'\n\n3:4:2:1313\\. They then touch it at the same time. Now the gods were fully\nagreed on this point, 'Verily, so and thus shall he of us fare who shall\ntransgress this (covenant) of ours!' And so are these (priests and sacrificer)\nnow agreed on this,--'Verily, so and thus shall he of us fare who shall\ntransgress this (covenant) of ours!'\n\n3:4:2:1414\\. They touch it simultaneously, with the text, 'Thou art the\nstrength of the gods, unassailed and unassailable; for the gods were indeed\nunassailed and unassailable while being together, and speaking with one accord\nand holding together.' 'The strength of the gods' doubtless means the\nfavourite forms and desirable powers of the gods, 'uncursed, curse-averting,\nuncursable,' for the gods have overcome every curse;--'May I straightway go to\nthe truth!' whereby he means to say, 'May I speak the truth, may I not\ntransgress this (covenant);'--'Establish me in welfare!' for in welfare the\ngods indeed established themselves by speaking the truth, by performing the\ntruth: therefore he says, 'Establish me in welfare!'\n\n3:4:2:1515\\. Now those favourite forms and desirable powers which the gods put\ntogether, they then deposited in Indra 1;--Indra verily is he that burns\nyonder (the sun); but he indeed did not burn in the beginning, but as now\neverything else is dark, so was he then; and it is by that very energy\n(derived\n\np. 97\n\nfrom those divine objects) that he burns. Hence, if many persons perform the\nconsecration 1, let it (the Tanunaptra butter), after pouring the fast-milk to\nit, be handed only to the master of the house, since he, among them, is the\nrepresentative of Indra. And if he perform the consecration by means of an\n(offering) with a dakshi _n_ a, let them hand it (the butter) to the\nsacrificer, after pouring the fast-milk to it, for thus it is said,--'The\nSacrificer is Indra.'\n\n3:4:2:1616\\. Now what favourite forms and desirable powers the gods then laid\ntogether, all that was wrought together and became the Saman: wherefore they\nsay, 'The Saman is the truth, the Saman is born of the gods.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[93:1](sbe2616.htm#fr_248) The Tanunaptra is a solemn covenant made by the\nsacrificer and his priests, in the name of Tanunapat, and while touching\nsacrificial butter; thereby pledging themselves not to injure each other.\n\n[93:2](sbe2616.htm#fr_249) Thus Ait.
