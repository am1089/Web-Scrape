There are both an animal and a sacrificial stake, for never do they\nimmolate an animal without a stake. And as to why this is so:--well, animals\ndid not at first submit thereto that they should become food, as they are now\nbecome food; for just as man here walks two-footed and erect, so did they walk\ntwo-footed and erect.\n\n3:7:3:22\\. Then the gods perceived that thunderbolt, to wit, the sacrificial\nstake; they raised it, and from fear thereof they (the animals) shrunk\ntogether and thus became four-footed, and thus became food, as they are now\nbecome food, for they submitted thereto: wherefore they immolate the animal\nonly at a stake and never without a stake.\n\n3:7:3:33\\. Having driven up the victim, and churned the fire, he binds it (to\nthe stake). And as to why this is so:--well, animals did not at first submit\nthereto that they should become sacrificial food, as they are now become\nsacrificial food and are offered up in the fire. The gods secured them: even\nthus secured they did not resign themselves.\n\n3:7:3:44\\. They spake, 'Verily, these (animals) know not the manner of this,\nthat it is in fire that sacrificial food is offered, nor (do they know) that\nsecure resort (the fire): let us offer fire into the fire after securing the\nanimals and churning the fire, and they will know that this truly is the\nmanner of sacrificial food,\n\np. 179\n\nthis its resort; that it is truly in fire that sacrificial food is offered:\nand accordingly they will resign themselves, and will be favourably disposed\nto the slaughtering.'\n\n3:7:3:55\\. Having, then, first secured the animals, and churned the fire, they\noffered fire into the fire; and then they (the animals) knew that this truly\nis the manner of sacrificial food, this its resort; that it is truly in fire\nthat sacrificial food is offered. And accordingly they resigned themselves,\nand became favourably disposed to the slaughtering.\n\n3:7:3:66\\. And in like manner does he now offer fire into the fire, after\nsecuring the animal and churning the fire. It (the animal) knows that this\ntruly is the manner of sacrificial food, this its resort; that it is truly in\nfire that sacrificial food is offered; and accordingly it resigns itself and\nbecomes favourably disposed to the slaughtering. Therefore having driven up\nthe victim and churned the fire, he binds it (to the stake).\n\n3:7:3:77\\. As to this they say, 'Let him not drive up (the victim), nor churn\nthe fire; but having taken the rope and straightway gone thither and put (the\nrope) round it, let him bind it.' Let him, however, not do this; for it would\nbe as if he intended to commit secretly some lawless action. Let him therefore\ngo round there.\n\n3:7:3:88\\. Then, taking a straw, he drives it up, thinking, 'having a\ncompanion, I will secure it;' for he who has a companion is strong.\n\n3:7:3:99\\. He takes the straw with (Va _g_. S. VI, 7), 'Thou art a cheerer!'\nfor a companion does cheer one: therefore he says, 'Thou art a cheerer.' 'The\ncelestial hosts have approached the gods;'\n\np. 180\n\nthe celestial hosts, forsooth, are those beasts: 'they have submitted to the\ngods' he means to say, when he says, 'The celestial hosts have approached the\ngods.'\n\n3:7:3:1010\\. 'The considerate 1, best of leaders;' for the gods are wise:\ntherefore he says, 'The considerate, best of leaders.'\n\n3:7:3:1111\\. 'O divine Tvash _t_ _ri_ , settle the wealth!' for Tvash _t_ _ri_\nis lord of beasts (cattle), and wealth means cattle, it is with regard to\nthose which did not submit that the gods then said to Tvash _t_ _ri_ , 'Quiet\nthem,' when he says, 'O divine Tvash _t_ _ri_ , settle the wealth!'\n\n3:7:3:1212\\. 'May the offerings be relished by thee!' Since they themselves\nsubmitted thereto that they should become sacrificial food, therefore he says,\n'May the offerings be relished by thee!'\n\n3:7:3:1313\\. 'Rejoice, ye prosperous!' for cattle are prosperous: therefore he\nsays, 'Rejoice ye prosperous.' 'O Lord of prayer, preserve our goods!' The\nLord of prayer, forsooth, is the Brahman; and goods mean cattle: those, which\ndid not submit, the gods on that occasion enclosed with the Brahman on the\nfarther side, and they did not pass over it. And in like manner does he now\nenclose them with the Brahman on the farther side, and they do not pass over\nit: therefore he says, 'O Lord of prayer, preserve our goods!' Having made a\nnoose he throws it over (the victim) 2. Now then as to the binding itself.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[180:1](sbe2629.htm#fr_456) U _s_ i _g_ rather means 'willing, loving,\ndevoted.'\n\n[180:2](sbe2629.htm#fr_457) According to the Taitt. authorities (Saya _n_ a on\nTaitt. S. I, 3, 8), the rope is wound round the right fore-leg and then passed\nupwards p. 181 to the head. From Katy. VI, 3, 27, on the other hand, it would\nseem that the rope is passed either between the horns (and under the neck?),\nor round the horns.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 7, 4.
