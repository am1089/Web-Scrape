Sitting; on account of possibility.\n\nIt has been shown that that special form of cognitional activity which the\nVedanta-texts set forth as the means of accomplishing final Release and which\nis called meditation (dhyana; upasana) has to be frequently repeated, and is\nof the nature of continued representation. A question now arises as to the way\nin which it has to be carried on.--There being no special restrictive rule,\nthe Purvapakshin holds that the Devotee may carry it on either sitting or\nlying down or standing or walking.--This view the Sutra sets aside. Meditation\nis to be carried on by the Devotee in a sitting posture, since in that posture\nonly the needful concentration of mind can be reached. Standing and walking\ndemand effort, and lying down is conducive to sleep. The proper posture is\nsitting on some support, so that no effort may be required for holding the\nbody up.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8. And on account of meditation](sbe48505.htm)\n\n'
