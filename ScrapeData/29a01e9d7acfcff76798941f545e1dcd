Now we will explain the rule for entering the order of ascetics (sa _m_\nnyasa).\n\n2\\. Some (teachers say), 'He who has finished his studentship may become an\nascetic immediately on (the completion of) that.' 2\n\n3\\. But (according to others, asceticism is befitting) for Salinas and\nYayavaras who are childless; 3\n\n4\\. Or a widower (may become an ascetic). 4\n\n5\\. (In general) they prescribe the profession of asceticism after the\ncompletion of the seventieth year and after the children have been firmly\nsettled in (the performance of) their sacred duties.\n\n6\\. Or a hermit in the woods (may become an 6\n\np. 274\n\nascetic) on finishing the (special) ceremonies (prescribed for him).\n\n7\\. 'That eternal greatness of the Brahma _n_ a is neither increased nor\ndiminished by works. The soul knows the nature of that (greatness). He who\nknows that, is not stained by evil deeds.' 7\n\n8\\. 'It leads to the cessation of births.'\n\n9\\. 'The eternal one leads (him) to glory.' The greatness (of asceticism is\ndeclared by these passages).\n\n10\\. After having caused the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his\nbody, and his nails to be cut, he prepares\n\n11\\. Sticks, a rope, a cloth for straining water, a water vessel, and an alms-\nbowl. 11\n\n12\\. Taking these (implements, let him go) to the extremity of the village, or\nto- the extremity of the boundary (of the village), or to the house where the\nsacred fires are kept, partake of a threefold (mixture of) clarified butter,\nmilk, (and) sour milk, and (afterwards) fast;\n\n13\\. Or (he may partake of) water.\n\n14\\. (Saying), 'Om, Bhu _h_ , I enter the Savitri, tat savitur vare _n_ yam;\nOm, Bhuva _h_ , I enter the Savitri, bhargo devasya dhimahi; Om, I enter the\nSavitri, dhiyo yo na _h_ pr.akodayat;' (he shall recite the Savitri) foot by\nfoot, half-verse by half-verse, (and finish by repeating) the whole or the\nparts (of the verse). 14\n\np. 275\n\n15\\. It is declared in the Veda, 'Entering order after order, (man) becomes\n(one with) Brahman.'\n\n16\\. Now they quote also (the following verse) 'He who has passed from order\nto order, has offered burnt oblations and kept his organs in subjection,\nbecomes afterwards, tired with (giving) alms and (making) offerings, an\nascetic.' 16\n\n17\\. Such an ascetic (becomes one with) the infinite (Brahman).\n\n18\\. Before the sun sets, he heaps fuel on the Garhapatya fire, brings the\nAnvaharyapa _k_ ana fire (to the spot), takes the flaming \xc3\x82havaniya. fire out\n(of the Garhapatya), melts butter on the Garhapatya fire, cleanses it (with Ku\n_s_ a grass), takes four times (portions of it) in the sacrificial spoon\n(called Sru _k_ ), and offers in the \xc3\x82havaniya fire on which sacred fuel has\nbeen heaped, (four times) a full oblation, (saying), 'Om, Svaha!' 18\n\n19\\. It is declared in the Veda that this (offering is) the Brahmanvadhana\n(putting fuel on the sacred fires for the sake of the universal soul).\n\n20\\. Now in the evening, after the Agnihotra has been offered, he scatters\ngrass to the north of the Garhapatya fire, places the sacrificial vessels in\npairs, the upper part turned downwards, on it, strews Darbha grass to the\nsouth of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire on the seat destined for the Brahman priest,\ncovers\n\np. 276\n\nit with the skin of a black antelope, and remains awake during that night.\n\n21\\. A Brahma _n_ a who, knowing this, dies after fasting during the night of\nBrahman and repositing within himself the sacred fires, conquers all guilt,\neven (that of) killing a Brahma _n_ a. 21\n\n22\\. Then he rises in the muhurta sacred to Brahman, and offers the early\nAgnihotra just at the (appointed) time.\n\n23\\. Next, after covering the (part of the altar called) P _ri_ sh _th_ ya and\nbringing water, he prepares (an offering) to (Agni) Vai _s_ vanara (which is\ncooked) in twelve potsherds. That (well-)known Ish _t_ i is the last (which he\nperforms).\n\n24\\. Afterwards he throws the sacrificial vessels, which are neither made of\nearth nor of stone, into the \xc3\x82havaniya fire,\n\n25\\. (And) throwing the two Ara _n_ is into the Garhapatya fire (with the\nwords), 'May ye be of one mind with us,' he reposits the sacred fires in\nhimself. 25\n\n26\\. (Reciting the sacred text), 'O Fire, that body of thine, which is fit for\nthe sacrifice,' he inhales the smell of (the smoke of) each fire thrice three\ntimes.\n\n27\\. Then, standing within the sacrificial enclosure, (he says) thrice in a\nlow voice and thrice aloud, 'Om, Bhu _h_ , Bhuva _h_ , Sva _h_ , I have\nentered the order of ascetics, I have entered the order of ascetics, I have\nentered the order of ascetics,'\n\np. 277\n\n28\\. It is declared in the Veda, 'The gods are trebly true.' 28\n\n29\\. (Finally) he pours out as much water as will fill his joined hands,\n(saying), 'I promise not to injure any living being.' 29\n\n30\\. Now they quote also (the following verse) An ascetic who roams about\nafter having given a promise of safety to all living beings, is not threatened\nwith danger by any creature.' 30\n\n31\\. (Henceforth) he must restrain his speech. 31\n\n32\\. He grasps his staff, (saying), '(Thou art my) friend, protect me.'\n\n33\\. He takes the rope, (reciting the verse), 'The brilliant light,' &c. 33\n\n34\\. He takes the cloth for straining water, (reciting the text), 'With which\nmeans of purification the gods,' &c.\n\n35\\. He takes the waterpot, (reciting the verse), Through that light, by which\nthe gods rose on high,' &c. 35\n\n36\\. He takes the alms-bowl, (reciting the Vyah _ri_ tis).\n\n37\\. Taking with him the staves, the rope, the 37\n\np. 278\n\ncloth for straining water, the waterpot, (and) the alms-bowl, he goes where\nwater (is to be obtained), bathes, sips water, (and) washes himself, (reciting\nthe verses called) Surabhimati, Abli\xe1\xb9\x85gas, Varu _n_ is, Hira _n_ yavar _n_ as,\nand Pavamanis. Entering the water, he performs sixteen suppressions of the\nbreath, (mentally repeating) the Aghamarsha _n_ a hymn, ascends the bank,\nwrings out his dress, puts on another pure dress, sips water, takes the cloth\nfor straining, (saying), 'Om, Bhu _h_ , Bhuva _h_ , Sva _h_ ,' and performs\nthe Tarpa _n_ a (with the following texts), 'Om, Bhu _h_ , I satiate,' 'Om,\nBhuva _h_ \\--, Om, Sva _h_ \\--, Om, Maha _h_ \\--, Om, Gana _h_ \\--, Om, Tapa\n_h_ \\--, Om, Satyam --.'\n\n38\\. He takes up as much water as his joined hands will hold for the manes,\n(and satiates them 38\n\nwith it) exactly in the same manner as the gods, (saying), 'Om, Bhu _h_\nSvadha, Om, Bhuva _h_ Svadha,' &c.\n\n39\\. Then he worships the sun, (reciting) the two verses (which begin), 'Ud u\ntya _m_ _k_ itram,' &c. 40\n\n40\\. (Saying), 'Om, this (syllable Om), forsooth, is Brahman; this (syllable)\nwhich sheds warmth is light; this which gives warmth is the Veda; this must be\nknown as that which sheds warmth;' he thus satiates the soul (and afterwards)\nworships the soul (with these texts), 'The soul (is) Brahman, (is) light.'\n\np. 279\n\n41\\. Let him repeat the Savitri one thousand times, or one hundred times, or\nan unlimited number of times.\n\n42\\. (Saying), 'Bhu _h_ , Bhuva _h_ , Suva _h_ ,' he takes up the cloth for\nstraining, (and) fetches water.\n\n43\\. Let him not, (at any period) after that (moment), sip water which has not\nbeen drawn up (from a well and the like), which has not been strained, and\nwhich has not been completely cleansed. 43\n\n44\\. Let him not wear any longer a white dress.\n\n45\\. (He may carry) one staff or three staves.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[273:2](sbe1471.htm#fr_1293) **17**. Gautama III, 1.\n\n[273:3](sbe1471.htm#fr_1294) Regarding the two terms Salina and Yayavara, see\nbelow, III, I, 3.4.\n\n[273:4](sbe1471.htm#fr_1295) Vidhura, translated, according to Govinda's\nexplanation, by 'widower,' perhaps includes all persons who have been\nseparated from their families.\n\n[273:6](sbe1471.htm#fr_1296) Regarding the ceremonies to be performed by\nhermits in the wood, see above, II, 6, 11, 15, and below, III, 3.\n\n[274:7](sbe1471.htm#fr_1297) See above, II, 6, 11, 30.\n\n[274:11](sbe1471.htm#fr_1298) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 58-60.\n\n[274:14](sbe1471.htm#fr_1299) This part of the ceremony is called Savitriprave\n_s_ a, 'entering the Savitri: According to the Dharmasindhu, fol. 84 a, 1. 8,\nthe last Mantra is 'Om, Bhu _h_ , Bhuva _h_ , Sva _h_ , I enter the Savitri;\nwe meditate on that adorable light of divine Savit _ri_ , who may impel our\nthoughts.'\n\n[275:16](sbe1471.htm#fr_1300) Manu VI, 34.\n\n[275:18](sbe1471.htm#fr_1301) Anvaharyapa _k_ ana is another name of the so-\ncalled Dakshi _n_ agni, in which the sacrificial viands are cooked. The\ncleansing of the butter (utpavana) is performed by taking hold of the ends of\nblades of Ku _s_ a grass and dipping the bent middle part into the melted\nbutter and then drawing it upwards. A full burnt oblation (pur _n_ ahuti)\nconsists of a whole spoonful. As four spoonfuls are to be taken out, it\nfollows that four oblations are to be offered.\n\n[276:21](sbe1471.htm#fr_1302) The night during which the ascetic keeps watch\nnear the fires is called 'the night of Brahman.'\n\n[276:25](sbe1471.htm#fr_1303) The Ara _n_ is are the two pieces of wood used\nfor producing fire by friction, Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita I, 3, 7, 1-2.\n\n[277:28](sbe1471.htm#fr_1304) Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka II, 18, 6.\n\n[277:29](sbe1471.htm#fr_1305) All gifts must be confirmed by a libation of\nwater, which ii other cases is poured into the hand of the recipient. The\nceremony proves more clearly even than the numerous other passages of the Sm\n_ri_ tis, in which ascetic, are exhorted to abstain from injuring living\nbeings, that the so-called ahi _m_ sa doctrine is not of Buddhistic, but of\nBrahmanical origin.\n\n[277:30](sbe1471.htm#fr_1306) Vasish _th_ a X, 1-2.\n\n[277:31](sbe1471.htm#fr_1307) Gautama III, 27.\n\n[277:33](sbe1471.htm#fr_1308) Taittiriya Brahma _n_ a III, 7, 8, 1.\n\n[277:35](sbe1471.htm#fr_1309) Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita V, 7, 2, 2,\n\n[277:37](sbe1471.htm#fr_1310) The Surabhimati occurs Taittiriya Brahma _n_ a\nIII, 9, 7, 5. For the other texts named, see above, II, 4, 7, 2. The Tarpa _n_\na has been fully described above, II, 5, 9-20.\n\n[278:38](sbe1471.htm#fr_1311) 'In he same manner as the gods,' i.e. without\npassing the sacred string over the right shoulder.--Govinda.\n\n[278:40](sbe1471.htm#fr_1312) The Gu _g_ arat and Dekhan MSS., including K.,\nplace after the first Om two additional Mantras, 'Brahman (is) Om; this\nuniverse (is) Om.' The object of the Mantras given in the Madras MSS. is to\nidentify the Pra _n_ ava with the Brahman, the sun, and the Veda.\n\n[279:43](sbe1471.htm#fr_1313) Manu VI, 46. Apariputabhi _h_ , 'which has not\nbeen completely cleansed,' probably refers to the so-called d _ri_ sh _t_ ya\nparipavana, 'carefully looking at it in order to see if any living being\nremains in it.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Adhyaya 10, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 18](sbe1472.htm)\n\n"
