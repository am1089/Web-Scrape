The seven Pavamanis are seven verses which\noccur Rig veda IX, 67, 21-27. Ya _g_ ushpavitra = Taitt. Sa _m_ h. I, 2, 1, 1.\nThe Samapavitra is found Sama-veda I, 2, 2, 3, 5. \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasapavitra = _Ri_ _g_\n-veda IV, 40, 5.\n\n[6:10](sbe0205.htm#fr_132) The commentator observes that for those whose\ngreat-great-grandfather or remoter ancestors were not initiated, no penance is\nprescribed, and that it must be fixed by those who know the law.\n\n[7:11](sbe0205.htm#fr_133) Manu II, 164.\n\n[7:12](sbe0205.htm#fr_134) Manu III, 1, and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 36; Weber, Ind.\nStud. X, 125.\n\n[7:16](sbe0205.htm#fr_135) The commentator declares that in Manu III, 1, the\nexpression until he has learnt it,' must be understood in this sense, that the\npupil may leave his teacher, if he has learnt the Veda, after twelve years'\nstudy, never before. But compare also \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_. Su. I, 22, 3.\n\n[7:17](sbe0205.htm#fr_136) The commentator states that this rule refers only\nto a temporary, not to a professed student (naish _th_ ika). He also gives an\nentirely different explanation to the Sutra, which, according to some, means,\n'A student who learns the sacred science shall not fast in order to obtain\nheaven.' This rendering also is admissible, as the word para may mean either a\n'stranger' or 'heaven' and upavasa, 'dwelling' or 'fasting.'\n\n[7:19](sbe0205.htm#fr_137) Regarding the crimes which cause loss of caste\n(pataniya), see below, I, 7, 21, 7.\n\n[7:20](sbe0205.htm#fr_138) Manu II, 108, and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 27.\n\n[7:21](sbe0205.htm#fr_139) Manu II, 108, 198; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 123 and\n124.\n\n[8:23](sbe0205.htm#fr_140) Regarding the meaning of kshara, 'pungent\ncondiments,' see Haradatta on II, 6, 15, 15. Other commentators explain the\nterm differently.--Manu II, 177; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 33; and Weber, Ind. Stud. X,\n123. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_. Su. I, 22, 2.\n\n[8:25](sbe0205.htm#fr_141) Manu II, 177; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 33.\n\n[8:26](sbe0205.htm#fr_142) Manu II, 180.\n\n[8:27](sbe0205.htm#fr_143) Manu II, 178; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 33.\n\n[8:29](sbe0205.htm#fr_144) 'Here, in the section on the teacher, the word guru\ndesignates the father and the rest also.'--Haradatta.\n\n[8:30](sbe0205.htm#fr_145) Another version of the first portion of this Sutra,\nproposed by Haradatta, is, 'Let him not, whilst bathing, clean himself (with\nbathing powder or the like).' Another commentator takes Sutra 28 as a\nprohibition of the daily bath or washing generally ordained for Brahma _n_ as,\nand refers Sutra 29. to the naimittika snana or 'bathing on certain\noccasions,' and takes Sutra 30 as a restriction of the latter.\n\n[8:31](sbe0205.htm#fr_146) Manu II, 2 19.\n\n[9:33](sbe0205.htm#fr_147) Manu II, 42-44; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 29; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_.\nSu. I, 19, 12; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 23.\n\n[9:38](sbe0205.htm#fr_148) Manu II, 45; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 29; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_.\nSu. I, 19, 13; 20, 1; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 23.\n\nHaradatta gives no commentary on this Sutra, but refers back to the G _ri_\nhya-sutra, II, 16-17, where the same words occur.\n\n[9:39](sbe0205.htm#fr_149) The word forms a Sutra by itself, in order to show\nthat every one must wear this cloth.\n\n[9:40](sbe0205.htm#fr_150) Manu II, 41. 'Clean' means here and everywhere\nelse, if applied to animals or things,' fit to be used at the sacrifice.'\n\n[9:41](sbe0205.htm#fr_151) \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_. Su. I, 19, 11; Weber, Ind. Stud X,\n22.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 1, Kha _n_ _d_ a 3](sbe0206.htm)\n\n"
