Organism of Soul.--I. _Upanishads._ --Every organic being is a soul,\naccording to the Upanishads; and the degree of its organic development is\ndirectly proportioned to the merits of its former works. The highest therefore\nare the souls of gods and men. The soul in its human embodiment exercises\nthree classes of functions: (1) the sense-organs _(indriya)_ , which in\nslumber or swoon become paralysed and merge themselves into (2) the organ of\nthought _(manas)_ , which converts the data of the sense-organs into conscious\nmodes of thought and volition; and (3) the "breaths" _(pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a)_, a term\noriginally denoting all the functions of physical life, then those higher\nfunctions upon which generally depends all life, whether conscious or\nunconscious, and into which during sleep or swoon are merged the _manas_ and\nthe sense-organs already absorbed in the latter.\n\nThe name _indriya_ for the sense-organs appears first in Ka\xe1\xb9\xadh. and Kau. Other\ntexts usually call them _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a_ (a collective term, from the supremacy of the\n_pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a,_ or breath), and comprise under the\n\np. 43\n\nname ordinarily breath, speech, sight, hearing, and _manas_ (e.g. B.A. I. iv.\n7). The same ten _indriyas_ as in the later system occur first in B.A. II. iv.\n11, IV. v. 12, which adds _manas_ and heart (cf. Pra. IV. 2). On _manas_ as\ncentral function of cognition and action see B.A. I. v. 3, IV. i. 6, Ch. VII.\niii f., Ka\xe1\xb9\xadh. VI. 7. The sense-organs are compared to horses drawing the car\nof the body, _manas_ to their bridle, Ka\xe1\xb9\xadh. III. 3; in Maitr. II. 6 the organs\nof action are the horses, the organs of intelligence (see below) the reins,\n_manas_ the driver. On the immersion of organs with _manas_ in _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a_ see\nespecially B.A. IV. iii. 12, Ch. VI. viii. 2, Pra. IV. 2 f. The "breaths" are\nusually given as five, viz.: (1) _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a_ in the strict sense, which in B.A.\nand Ch. denotes exspiration, and later exspiration and inspiration together;\n(2) _ap \xc4\x81na,_ in B.A. and Ch. the inspiration, later the wind causing\ndigestion in the bowels or evacuation; (3) _vy \xc4\x81na,_ respiratory action\nconnecting _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a_ and _ap \xc4\x81na,_ variously conceived; (4) _sam \xc4\x81na_,\nsometimes the wind digesting food, sometimes connection between exspiration\nand inspiration; (5) _ud \xc4\x81na,_ which carries food and drink up and down\n(Maitr. II. 6) and guides the soul to Brahma in death and sleep (Pra. III. 7,\nIV. 4).\n\nII. _Later Ved \xc4\x81nta._--In the system of \xc5\x9aankara the gross body, subtle body (\xc2\xa7\n19), _karm \xc4\x81\xc5\x9braya_ (\xc2\xa7 20), and _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as_ are classed together as the\n"determinations" or _up \xc4\x81dhis_ by which the Self\n\np. 44\n\nconceives itself as an individual soul (above, \xc2\xa7 12). Whereas the gross body\nis abandoned on death, the other organisms travel in a potential form with the\nsoul throughout all its births. By the term _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a_ \xc5\x9aankara, following the\nold Upanishadic usage, designates not only the unconscious "breaths," but also\nthe conscious _indriyas._ The _indriyas_ (the functional forces whence arise\nthe material sense-organs) according to him comprise the five functions of\naction (viz. speech, grasp, locomotion, generation, and excretion) and the\nfive of _buddhi_ or intelligence (viz. sight, hearing, taste, touch, and\nsmell), with which is associated the _manas_ as their centre. The _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as,_\nor "breaths" in the strict sense are the five known in the Upanishads. \xc5\x9aankara\nexplains _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a_ as exspiration, _ap \xc4\x81na_ as inspiration, _vy \xc4\x81na_ as the\nforce maintaining life when both exspiration and inspiration are checked, _sam\n\xc4\x81na_ as the digestive force, and _ud \xc4\x81na_ as the current leading the soul from\nthe body on death (on II. iv. 8 f.). When death takes place, the _indriya_ s\nsink into _manas,_ this into the _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as,_ these into the individual soul\n(lodged in the heart), this into the "subtle body" (\xc2\xa7 19), which then starts\non its wanderings. Thus \xc5\x9aankara (on IV. ii. 1 f.) explains the statement of\nCh. VI. viii. 6 that on death Speech is merged in _manas,_ this into _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a,_\nthis into Heat, this into the Higher Godhead. These words, he holds, mean that\nthe potential functions of conscious sensation are\n\np. 45\n\nmerged into those of unconscious vitality, the latter into the individual\nsoul, this again into the "Heat," i.e. the "subtle body," which conveys the\nsoul through its wanderings. See also \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 12, 15.\n\nThe later Ved\xc4\x81nta (e.g. the Ved\xc4\x81nta-s\xc4\x81ra and the \xc4\x80tma-viveka and V\xc4\x81kya-sudh\xc4\x81\nascribed to \xc5\x9aankara) schematises the functions of empiric thought by dividing\nthe _anta \xe1\xb8\xa5-kara\xe1\xb9\x87a,_ its collective organisation, into _chitta,_ _manas_\n(often loosely called _anta \xe1\xb8\xa5-kara\xe1\xb9\x87a_), _buddhi,_ and _aha \xe1\xb9\x83-k\xc4\x81ra._ To\n_chitta_ it ascribes the function of passing notice, to _manas_ that of\ndeliberation, and to _buddhi_ that of determination. Sometimes also it uses\n_buddhi_ as a general term denoting both _aha \xe1\xb9\x83-k\xc4\x81ra,_ the conception of\negoity, which is the agent in empiric mental action, and _manas,_ the\ninstrument of egoity; in the false identification of these functions with the\nSelf or Spirit lies the root of phenomenal illusion.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Subtle Body](brk22.htm)\n\n'
