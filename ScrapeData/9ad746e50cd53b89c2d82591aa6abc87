The bhuman (is the highest Self), as the instruction about it is\nadditional to that about serenity.\n\nThe _Kh_ andogas read as follows: \'Where one sees nothing\n\np. 300\n\nelse, hears nothing else, knows nothing else, that is fulness (bhuman). Where\none sees something else, hears something else, knows something else, that is\nthe Little\' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 23, 24).\n\nThe term \'bhuman\' is derived from _bahu_ (much, many), and primarily signifies\n\'muchness.\' By \'much\' in this connexion, we have however to understand, not\nwhat is numerous, but what is large, for the text uses the term in contrast\nwith the \'Little\' (alpa), i.e. the \'Small.\' And the being qualified as\n\'large,\' we conclude from the context to be the Self; for this section of the\nUpanishad at the outset states that he who knows the Self overcomes grief\n(VII, 1, 3), then teaches the knowledge of the bhuman, and concludes by saying\nthat \'the Self is all this\' (VII, 25, 2).\n\nThe question now arises whether the Self called bhuman is the individual Self\nor the highest Self.--The Purvapakshin maintains the former view. For, he\nsays, to Narada who had approached Sanatkumara with the desire to be\ninstructed about the Self, a series of beings, beginning with \'name\' and\nending with \'breath,\' are enumerated as objects of devout meditation; Narada\nasks each time whether there be anything greater than name, and so on, and\neach time receives an affirmative reply (\'speech is greater than name,\' &c.);\nwhen, however, the series has advanced as far as Breath, there is no such\nquestion and reply. This shows that the instruction about the Self terminates\nwith Breath, and hence we conclude that breath in this place means the\nindividual soul which is associated with breath, not a mere modification of\nair. Also the clauses \'Breath is father, breath is mother,\' &c. (VII, 15, 1),\nshow that breath here is something intelligent. And this is further proved by\nthe clause \'Slayer of thy father, slayer of thy mother,\' &c. (VII, 15, 2; 3),\nwhich declares that he who offends a father, a mother, &c., as long as there\nis breath in them, really hurts them, and therefore deserves reproach; while\nno blame attaches to him who offers even the grossest violence to them after\ntheir breath has departed. For a conscious being only is capable of being\n\np. 301\n\nhurt, and hence the word \'breath\' here denotes such a being only. Moreover, as\nit is observed that also in the case of such living beings as have no vital\nbreath (viz. plants), suffering results, or does not result, according as\ninjury is inflicted or not, we must for this reason also decide that the\nbreath spoken of in the text as something susceptible of injury is the\nindividual soul. It consequently would be an error to suppose, on the ground\nof the comparison of Pra _n_ a to the nave of a wheel in which the spokes are\nset, that Pra _n_ a here denotes the highest Self; for the highest Self is\nincapable of being injured. That comparison, on the other hand, is quite in\nits place, if we understand by Pra _n_ a the individual soul, for the whole\naggregate of non-sentient matter which stands to the individual soul in the\nrelation of object or instrument of enjoyment, has an existence dependent on\nthe individual soul. And this soul, there called Pra _n_ a, is what the text\nlater on calls Bhuman; for as there is no question and reply as to something\ngreater than Pra _n_ a , Pra _n_ a continues, without break, to be the\nsubject-matter up to the mention of bhuman. The paragraphs intervening between\nthe section on Pra _n_ a (VII, 15) and the section on the bhuman (VII, 23 ff.)\nare to be understood as follows. The Pra _n_ a section closes with the remark\nthat he who fully knows Pra _n_ a is an ativadin, i.e. one who makes a final\nsupreme declaration. In the next sentence then, \'But this one in truth is an\nativadin who makes a supreme statement by means of the True,\' the clause \'But\nthis one is an ativadin\' refers back to the previously mentioned person who\nknows the Pra _n_ a, and the relative clause \'who makes,\' &c., enjoins on him\nthe speaking of the truth as an auxiliary element in the meditation on Pra _n_\na . The next paragraph, \'When one understands the truth then one declares the\ntruth,\' intimates that speaking the truth stands in a supplementary relation\ntowards the cognition of the true nature of the Pra _n_ a as described before.\nFor the accomplishment of such cognition the subsequent four paragraphs enjoin\nreflection, faith, attendance on a spiritual guide, and the due performance of\nsacred duties. In order that such\n\np. 302\n\nduties may be undertaken, the next paragraphs then teach that bliss\nconstitutes the nature of the individual soul, previously called Pra _n_ a,\nand finally that the Bhuman, i.e. the supreme fulness of such bliss, is the\nproper object of inquiry. The final purport of the teaching, therefore, is\nthat the true nature of the individual soul, freed from Nescience, is abundant\nbliss--a conclusion which perfectly agrees with the initial statement that he\nwho knows the Self passes beyond sorrow. That being, therefore, which has the\nattribute of being \'bhuman,\' is the individual Self. This being so, it is also\nintelligible why, further on, when the text describes the glory and power of\nthe individual Self, it uses the term \'I\'; for \'I\' denotes just the individual\nSelf: \'I am below, I am above, &c., I am all this\' (VII, 25, 1). This\nconclusion having been settled, all remaining clauses must be explained so as\nto agree with it.\n\nThis prima facie view is set aside by the Sutra. The being characterised in\nthe text as \'bhuman\' is not the individual Self, but the highest Self, since\ninstruction is given about the bhuman in addition to \'serenity\' (sa _m_\nprasada). \'Sa _m_ prasada\' denotes the individual soul, as we know from the\nfollowing text, \'Now that "serenity", having risen from out this body, and\nhaving reached the highest light, appears in its true form\' ( _Kh_. Up.VIII,\n3, 4). Now in the text under discussion instruction is given about a being\ncalled \'the True,\' and possessing the attribute of \'bhuman,\' as being\nsomething additional to the individual soul; and this being called \'the True\'\nis none other than the highest Brahman. Just as in the series of beings\nbeginning with name and ending with breath, each successive being is mentioned\nin addition to the preceding one--wherefrom we conclude that it is something\nreally different from what precedes; so that being also which is called \'the\nTrue,\' and which is mentioned in addition to the individual Self called Pra\n_n_ a, is something different from the individual Self, and this being called\n\'the True\' is the same as the Bhuman; in other words, the text teaches that\nthe Bhuman is the highest Brahman called \'the True.\' This the V _ri_ ttikara\nalso declares: \'But the Bhuman only. The Bhuman\n\np. 303\n\nis Brahman, because in the series beginning with name instruction is given\nabout it subsequently to the individual Self.\'\n\nBut how do we know that the instruction as to \'the True\' is in addition to,\nand refers to something different from, the being called Pra _n_ a?--The text,\nafter having declared that he who knows the Pra _n_ a is an ativadin, goes on,\n\'But really that one is an ativadin who makes a supreme declaration by means\nof the True.\' The \'but\' here clearly separates him who is an ativadin by means\nof the True from the previous ativadin, and the clause thus does not cause us\nto recognise him who is ativadin by means of Pra _n_ a; hence \'the True\' which\nis the cause of the latter ativadin being what he is must be something\ndifferent from the Pra _n_ a which is the cause of the former ativadin\'s\nquality.--But we have maintained above that the text enjoins the speaking of\n\'the True\' merely as an auxiliary duty for him who knows Pra _n_ a; and that\nhence the Pra _n_ a continues to be the general subject-matter!--This\ncontention is untenable, we reply. The conjunction \'but\' shows that the\nsection gives instruction about a new ativadin, and does not merely declare\nthat the ativadin previously mentioned has to speak the truth. It is different\nwith texts such as \'But that one indeed is an Agnihotrin who speaks the\ntruth\'; there we have no knowledge of any further Agnihotrin, and therefore\nmust interpret the text as enjoining truthfulness as an obligation incumbent\non the ordinary Agnihotrin. In the text under discussion, on the other hand,\nwe have the term \'the True\', which makes us apprehend that there is a further\nativadin different from the preceding one; and we know that that term is used\nto denote the highest Brahman, as e.g. in the text, \'The True, knowledge, the\nInfinite is Brahman.\' The ativadin who takes his stand on this Brahman,\ntherefore, must be viewed as different from the preceding ativadin; and a\ndifference thus established on the basis of the meaning and connexion of the\ndifferent sentences cannot be set aside. An ativadin (\'one who in his\ndeclaration goes beyond\') is one who maintains, as object of his devotion,\n\np. 304\n\nsomething which, as being more beneficial to man, surpasses other objects of\ndevotion. The text at first declares that he who knows Pra _n_ a, i.e. the\nindividual soul, is an ativadin, in so far as the object of his devout\nmeditation surpasses the objects from name up to hope; and then goes on to say\nthat, as that object also is not of _supreme_ benefit to man, an ativadin in\nthe full sense of the term is he only who proclaims as the object of his\ndevotion the highest Brahman, which alone is of supreme unsurpassable benefit\nto man. \'He who is an ativadin by the True,\' i.e. he who is an ativadin\ncharacterised by the highest Brahman as the object of his meditation. For the\nsame reason the pupil entreats, \'Sir, may I be an ativadin with the True!\' and\nthe teacher replies, \'But we must desire to know the True!\'--Moreover, the\ntext, VII, 26, I, \'Pra _n_ a springs from the Self,\' declares the origination\nfrom the Self of the being called Pra _n_ a; and from this we infer that the\nSelf which is introduced as the general subject-matter of the section, in the\nclause \'He who knows the Self passes beyond death,\' is different from the\nbeing called Pra _n_ a.--The contention that, because there is no question and\nanswer as to something greater than Pra _n_ a, the instruction about the Self\nmust be supposed to come to an end with the instruction about Pra _n_ a, is by\nno means legitimate. For that a new subject is introduced is proved, not only\nby those questions and answers; it may be proved by other means also, and we\nhave already explained such means. The following is the reason why the pupil\ndoes not ask the question whether there is anything greater than Pra _n_ a.\nWith regard to the non-sentient objects extending from name to hope--each of\nwhich surpasses the preceding one in so far as it is more beneficial to man--\nthe teacher does not declare that he who knows them is an ativadin; when,\nhowever, he comes to the individual soul, there called Pra _n_ a, the\nknowledge of whose true nature he considers highly beneficial, he expressly\nsays that \'he who sees this, notes this, understands this is an ativadin\'\n(VII, 15, 4). The pupil therefore imagines that the instruction about the Self\nis now completed, and hence asks no further question. The\n\np. 305\n\nteacher on the other hand, holding that even that knowledge is not the\nhighest, spontaneously continues his teaching, and tells the pupil that truly\nhe only is an ativadin who proclaims the supremely and absolutely beneficial\nbeing which is called \'the True,\' i.e. the highest Brahman. On this suggestion\nof the highest Brahman the pupil, desirous to learn its true nature and true\nworship, entreats the teacher, \'Sir, may I become an ativadin by the True!\'\nThereupon the teacher--in order to help the pupil to become an ativadin,--a\nposition which requires previous intuition of Brahman--enjoins on him\nmeditation on Brahman which is the means to attain intuition (\'You must desire\nto know the True!\'); next recommends to him reflection (manana) which is the\nmeans towards meditation (\'You must desire to understand reflection\'); then--\ntaking it for granted that the injunction of reflection implies the injunction\nof \'hearing\' the sacred texts which is the preliminary for reflecting--advises\nhim to cherish faith in Brahman which is the preliminary means towards hearing\n(\'You must desire to understand faith \'); after that tells him to practise, as\na preliminary towards faith, reliance on Brahman (\'You must desire to\nunderstand reliance\'); next admonishes him, to apply himself to \'action,\' i.e.\nto make the effort which is a preliminary requisite for all the activities\nenumerated (\'You must desire to understand action\'). Finally, in order to\nencourage the pupil to enter on all this, the teacher tells him to recognise\nthat bliss constitutes the nature of that Brahman which is the aim of all his\neffort (\'You must desire to understand bliss \'); and bids him to realise that\nthe bliss which constitutes Brahman\'s nature is supremely large and full (\'You\nmust endeavour to understand the "bhuman," i.e. the supreme fulness of\nbliss\'). And of this Brahman, whose nature is absolute bliss, a definition is\nthen given as follows,\' Where one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, knows\nnothing else, that is bhuman.\' This means--when the meditating devotee\nrealises the intuition of this Brahman, which consists of absolute bliss, he\ndoes not see anything apart from it, since the whole aggregate of things is\ncontained within\n\np. 306\n\nthe essence and outward manifestation (vibhuti) of Brahman. He, therefore, who\nhas an intuitive knowledge of Brahman as qualified by its attributes and its\nvibhuti--which also is called ai _s_ varya, i.e. lordly power--and consisting\nof supreme bliss, sees nothing else since there _is_ nothing apart from\nBrahman; and sees, i.e. feels no pain since all possible objects of perception\nand feeling are of the nature of bliss or pleasure; for pleasure is just that\nwhich, being experienced, is agreeable to man\'s nature.--But an objection is\nraised, it is an actual fact that this very world is perceived as something\ndifferent from Brahman, and as being of the nature of pain, or at the best,\nlimited pleasure; how then can it be perceived as being a manifestation of\nBrahman, as having Brahman for its Self, and hence consisting of bliss?--The\nindividual souls, we reply, which are under the influence of karman, are\nconscious of this world as different from Brahman, and, according to their\nindividual karman, as either made up of pain or limited pleasure. But as this\nview depends altogether on karman, to him who has freed himself from Nescience\nin the form of karman, this same world presents itself as lying within the\nintuition of Brahman, together with its qualities and vibhuti, and hence as\nessentially blissful. To a man troubled with excess of bile the water he\ndrinks has a taste either downright unpleasant or moderately pleasant,\naccording to the degree to which his health is affected; while the same water\nhas an unmixedly pleasant taste for a man in good health. As long as a boy is\nnot aware that some plaything is meant to amuse him, he does not care for it;\nwhen on the other hand he apprehends it as meant to give him delight, the\nthing becomes very dear to him. In the same way the world becomes an object of\nsupreme love to him who recognises it as having Brahman for its Self, and\nbeing a mere plaything of Brahman--of Brahman, whose essential nature is\nsupreme bliss, and which is a treasure-house, as it were, of numberless\nauspicious qualities of supreme excellence. He who has reached such intuition\nof Brahman, sees nothing apart from it and feels no pain. This the concluding\npassages of the text set\n\np. 307\n\nforth in detail, \'He who sees, perceives and understands this, loves the Self,\ndelights in the Self, revels in the Self, rejoices in the Self; he becomes a\nSelf ruler, he moves and rules in all worlds according to his pleasure. But\nthose who have a different knowledge from this, they are ruled by others, they\nlive in perishable worlds, they do not move in all the worlds according to\ntheir liking.\' \'They are ruled by others,\' means \'they are in the power of\nkarman.\' And further on, \'He who sees this does not see death, nor illness,\nnor pain; he who sees this sees everything and obtains everything everywhere.\'\n\nThat Brahman is of the nature of supreme bliss has been shown in detail under\nI, 1, 12 ff.--The conclusion from all this is that, as the text applies the\nterm \'bhuman\' to what was previously called the Real or True, and which is\ndifferent from the individual soul there called Pra _n_ a, the bhuman is the\nhighest Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8.
