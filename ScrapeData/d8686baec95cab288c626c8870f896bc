The setting up of the \xc3\x82vasathya (or sacred domestic) fire (is performed)\nat the time of his wedding.\n\np. 271\n\n2 2. At the time of the division of the inheritance, according to some\n(teachers).\n\n3 3 After he has fetched fire from the house of a Vai _s_ ya who is rich in\ncattle,\xc2\x97\n\n4 4. All ceremonies are performed as at the cooking of the _k_ atushpra _s_ ya\nfood.\n\n5 5. Some (say that) the handing over of the kindling sticks (should take\nplace),\n\n6 6. Because the _S_ ruti says, 'There are five great sacrifices.'\n\n7 7. Having cooked a mess of sacrificial food for the deities of the\nAgnyadheya, and having sacrificed the two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions, he sacrifices\n(the following) \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations:\n\n8 8. 'Thou, Agni' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ hita XXI, 3); 'Thus\n\np. 272\n\nthou, Agni' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ hita XXI, 4); 'This, O Varu _n_ a' (XXI, 1); 'For\nthis I entreat thee' (XXI, 2); 'Thy hundred' (Katy.- _S_ raut. XXV, 1, 11);\n'And quick, Agni' (Katy. l.l.); 'The highest one' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XII, 12);\n'Be both to us' (ibid. V, 3)\xc2\x97with (these verses he sacrifices) eight\n(oblations) before (the oblations of cooked food).\n\n9\\. Thus he sacrifices also afterwards, after he has made oblations of the\nmess of cooked food to the deities of the Agnyadheya.\n\n10\\. And to (Agni) Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t,\n\n11 11. With (the formulas), 'Into the quick one (has been put) Agni's\n(sacrificial portion) over which the word vasha _t_ has been spoken;' 'What I\nhave done too much;' 'O gods who know the way.'\n\n12 12. Having sacrificed the Barhis, he partakes (of the sacrificial food).\n\n13\\. Then food is given to the Brahma _n_ as.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[270:1](sbe29156.htm#fr_666) 2, 1. Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I, 1, 3.\n\n[271:2](sbe29156.htm#fr_667) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 1, 4.\n\n[271:3](sbe29156.htm#fr_668) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 1, 8.\n\n[271:4](sbe29156.htm#fr_669) The _k_ atushpra _s_ ya food is prepared, at the\ntime of the setting up of the _S_ rauta fires, for the four chief officiating\npriests of the _S_ rauta sacrifices. Comp. _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a II, 1, 4.\nKatyayana's corresponding rules with regard to the \xc3\x82dhana of the _S_ rauta\nfires are found at IV, 7, 15. 16.\n\n[271:5](sbe29156.htm#fr_670) Comp. the remarks on this Sutra, in the\nIntroduction, pp. [265](sbe29154.htm#page_265) seq.\n\n[271:6](sbe29156.htm#fr_671) _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a XI, 5, 6, 1: 'There are\nfive great sacrifices which are great Sattras, viz. the sacrifice to living\nbeings, the sacrifice to men, the sacrifice to the Manes, the sacrifice to the\ngods, the Brahmaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a.' As the G _ri_ hya ceremonies are included here\nunder the category of mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as or great sacrifices, they require,\naccording to the teachers whose opinion is stated in Sutra 5, a form of the\nAgnyadhana (setting up of the sacred fire) analogous to the Agnyadhana of the\n_S_ rauta ritual, and containing, like that \xc3\x82dhana, the act of the Ara _n_\nipradana or handing over of the kindling woods (Sutra 5).\n\n[271:7](sbe29156.htm#fr_672) The deities of the Agnyadheya, or of the _S_\nrauta ceremony corresponding to the G _ri_ hya rite here treated of, are Agni\npavamana, Agni pavaka, Agni _s_ u _k_ i, Aditi. On the \xc3\x82 _g_ yabhagas, see _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 9, 7, &c.\n\n[271:8](sbe29156.htm#fr_673) The verses Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XXI, 3, 4, the two\nverses quoted p. 272 Katy. XXV, 1, 11, and fifthly the verse Va _g_. Sa _m_ h.\nXII, 12, are prescribed for the Sarvapraya _s_ _k_ itta (or general expiatory\nceremony), see Katyayana l.l.\n\n[272:11](sbe29156.htm#fr_674) Professor Stenzler, following _G_ ayarama, takes\nthe whole as one Mantra, which he translates: 'Ungehemmet sei Agni's Spende,\ndie durch die That ich uberreich machte, bahnschaffende Gotter!' But the words\nyat karma _n_ atyariri _k_ am are the opening words of a Mantra quoted _S_\natapatha Brahma _n_ a XIV, 9, 4, 24, (comp. also \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya I,\n10, 23; the connection in which atyariri _k_ am there stands, shows that the\nword designates a mistake made in the sacrificial work by doing too much.) The\nwords deva gatuvida _h_ are the Pratika of Va _g_. Sa _m_ hita VIII, 21. Thus\nI have no doubt that also ayasy Agner vasha _t_ k _ri_ tam (or possibly ayasy\nAgner (?) and vasha _t_ k _ri_ tam (?)) is a Pratika. Of course, the\ntranslation of these words must remain uncertain until the Mantra to which\nthey belong has been discovered.\n\n[272:12](sbe29156.htm#fr_675) On the throwing into the fire of the Barhis,\ncomp.
