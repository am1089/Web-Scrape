They sink anew  \nInto the realm of Flesh, where all things change!\n\nBy Me the whole vast Universe of things  \nIs spread abroad;- by Me, the Unmanifest!  \nIn Me are all existences contained;  \nNot I in them!  \nYet they are not contained,  \nThose visible things! Receive and strive to embrace  \nThe mystery majestical! My Being-  \nCreating all, sustaining all- still dwells  \nOutside of all!\n\nSee! as the shoreless airs  \nMove in the measureless space, but are not space,  \n[And space were space without the moving airs];  \nSo all things are in Me, but are not I.\n\nAt closing of each Kalpa, Indian Prince!  \nAll things which be back to My Being come:  \nAt the beginning of each Kalpa, all  \nIssue new-born from Me.\n\nBy Energy  \nAnd help of Prakriti, my outer Self,  \nAgain, and yet again, I make go forth  \nThe realms of visible things- without their will-  \nAll of them- by the power of Prakriti.\n\nYet these great makings, Prince! involve Me not  \nEnchain Me not ! I sit apart from them,  \nOther, and Higher, and Free; nowise attached!\n\nThus doth the stuff of worlds, moulded by Me,  \nBring forth all that which is, moving or still,  \nLiving or lifeless! Thus the worlds go on!\n\nThe minds untaught mistake Me, veiled in form;-  \nNaught see they of My secret Presence, nought  \nOf My hid Nature, ruling all which lives.  \nVain hopes pursuing, vain deeds doing; fed  \nOn vainest knowledge, senselessly they seek  \nAn evil way, the way of brutes and fiends.  \nBut My Mahatmas, those of noble soul  \nWho tread the path celestial, worship Me  \nWith hearts unwandering,- knowing Me the Source,  \nTh\' Eternal Source, of Life. Unendingly  \nThey glorify Me; seek Me; keep their vows  \nOf reverence and love, with changeless faith  \nAdoring Me. Yea, and those too adore,  \nWho, offering sacrifice of wakened hearts,  \nHave sense of one pervading Spirit\'s stress,  \nOne Force in every place, though manifold!  \nI am the Sacrifice! I am the Prayer!  \nI am the Funeral-Cake set for the dead!  \nI am the healing herb! I am the ghee,  \nThe Mantra, and the flame, and that which burns!  \nI am- of all this boundless Universe-  \nThe Father, Mother, Ancestor, and Guard!  \nThe end of Learning! That which purifies  \nIn lustral water! I am OM! I am  \nRig-Veda, Sama-Veda, Yajur-Ved;  \nThe Way, the Fosterer, the Lord, the Judge,  \nThe Witness; the Abode, the Refuge-House,  \nThe Friend, the Fountain and the Sea of Life  \nWhich sends, and swallows up; Treasure of Worlds  \nAnd Treasure-Chamber! Seed and Seed-Sower,  \nWhence endless harvests spring! Sun\'s heat is mine;  \nHeaven\'s rain is mine to grant or to withhold;  \nDeath am I, and Immortal Life I am,  \nArjuna! SAT and ASAT, Visible Life,  \nAnd Life Invisible!  \nYea! those who learn  \nThe threefold Veds, who drink the Soma-wine,  \nPurge sins, pay sacrifice- from Me they earn  \nPassage to Swarga; where the meats divine\n\nOf great gods feed them in high Indra\'s heaven.  \nYet they, when that prodigious joy is o\'er,  \nParadise spent, and wage for merits given,  \nCome to the world of death and change once more.\n\nThey had their recompense! they stored their treasure,  \nFollowing the threefold Scripture and its writ;  \nWho seeketh such gaineth the fleeting pleasure  \nOf joy which comes and goes! I grant them it!\n\nBut to those blessed ones who worship Me,  \nTurning not otherwhere, with minds set fast,  \nI bring assurance of full bliss beyond.\n\nNay, and of hearts which follow other gods  \nIn simple faith, their prayers arise to me,  \nO Kunti\'s Son! though they pray wrongfully;  \nFor I am the Receiver and the Lord  \nOf every sacrifice, which these know not  \nRightfully; so they fall to earth again!  \nWho follow gods go to their gods; who vow  \nTheir souls to Pitris go to Pitris; minds  \nTo evil Bhuts given o\'er sink to the Bhuts;  \nAnd whoso loveth Me cometh to Me.  \nWhoso shall offer Me in faith and love  \nA leaf, a flower, a fruit, water poured forth,  \nThat offering I accept, lovingly made  \nWith pious will. Whate\'er thou doest, Prince!  \nEating or sacrificing, giving gifts,  \nPraying or fasting, let it all be done  \nFor Me, as Mine. So shalt thou free thyself  \nFrom Karmabandh, the chain which holdeth men  \nTo good and evil issue, so shalt come  \nSafe unto Me- when thou art quit of flesh-  \nBy faith and abdication joined to Me!\n\nI am alike for all! I know not hate,  \nI know not favour! What is made is Mine!  \nBut them that worship Me with love, I love;  \nThey are in Me, and I in them!\n\nNay, Prince!  \nIf one of evil life turn in his thought  \nStraightly to Me, count him amidst the good;  \nHe hath the high way chosen; he shall grow  \nRighteous ere long; he shall attain that peace  \nWhich changes not. Thou Prince of India!  \nBe certain none can perish, trusting Me!  \nO Pritha\'s Son! whoso will turn to Me,  \nThough they be born from the very womb of Sin,  \nWoman or man; sprung of the Vaisya caste  \nOr lowly disregarded Sudra,- all  \nPlant foot upon the highest path; how then  \nThe holy Brahmans and My Royal Saints?  \nAh! ye who into this ill world are come-  \nFleeting and false- set your faith fast on Me!  \nFix heart and thought on Me! Adore Me! Bring  \nOfferings to Me! Make Me prostrations! Make  \nMe your supremest joy! and, undivided,  \nUnto My rest your spirits shall be guided.\n\n  \nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER IX OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Rajavidyarajaguhyayog,"  \nOr "The Book of Religion by the Kingly Knowledge  \nand the Kingly Mystery."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 10: Of Religion by the Heavenly Perfections](bg10.htm)\n\n'
