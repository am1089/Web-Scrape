A _S_ udra who intentionally reviles twice-born men by criminal abuse, or\ncriminally assaults them with blows, shall be deprived of the limb with which\nhe offends. 1\n\np. 239\n\n2\\. If he has criminal intercourse with an \xc3\x82ryan woman, his organ shall be cut\noff, and all his property be confiscated. 2\n\n3\\. If (the woman had) a protector, he shall be executed after (having\nundergone the punishments prescribed above). 3\n\n4\\. Now if he listens intentionally to (a recitation of) the Veda, his ears\nshall be filled with (molten) tin or lac.\n\n5\\. If he recites (Vedic texts), his tongue shall be cut out.\n\n6\\. If he remembers them, his body shall be split in twain.\n\n7\\. If he assumes a position equal (to that of twice-born men) in sitting, in\nlying down, in conversation or on the road, he shall undergo (corporal)\npunishment. 7\n\n8\\. A Kshatriya (shall be fined) one hundred (Karshapa _n_ as) if he abuses a\nBrahma _n_ a, 8\n\n9\\. In case of an assault, twice as much.\n\np. 240\n\n10\\. A Vai _s_ ya (who abuses a Brahma _n_ a, shall pay) one and a half (times\nas much as a Kshatriya). 10\n\n11\\. But a Brahma _n_ a (who abuses) a Kshatriya (shall pay) fifty (Karshapa\n_n_ as), 11\n\n12\\. One half of that (amount if he abuses) a Vai _s_ ya, 12\n\n13\\. (And if he abuses) a _S_ udra, nothing. 13\n\n14\\. A Kshatriya and a Vai _s_ ya (who abuse one another shall pay the same\nfines) as a Brahma _n_ a and a Kshatriya. 14\n\n15\\. (The value of) property which a _S_ udra unrighteously acquires by theft,\nmust be repaid eightfold. 15\n\n16\\. For each of the other castes (the fines must be) doubled. 16\n\n17\\. If a learned man offends, the punishment shall be very much increased. 17\n\n18\\. If fruits, green corn, and vegetables are appropriated in small amounts,\n(the fine is) five K _ri_ sh _n_ alas (of copper). 18\n\np. 241\n\n19\\. If damage is done by cattle, the responsibility falls on the owner.\n\n20\\. But if (the cattle) were attended by a herdsman, (it falls) on the\nlatter. 20\n\n21\\. (If the damage was done) in an unenclosed field near the road, (the\nresponsibility falls) on the herdsman and on the owner of the field.\n\n22\\. Five Mashas (are the fine to be paid) for (damage done by) a cow, 22\n\n23\\. Six for a camel or a donkey,\n\n24\\. Ten for a horse or a buffalo,\n\n25\\. Two for each goat or sheep.\n\n26\\. If all is destroyed, (the value of) the whole crop (must be paid and a\nfine in addition).\n\n27\\. If (a man) always neglects the prescribed (duties) and does that which is\nforbidden, his property beyond (the amount required for) raiment and food\nshall be taken from him (until he amends). 27\n\n28\\. He may take, as his own, grass for a cow, and fuel for his fire, as well\nas the flowers of creepers and trees and their fruit, if they be unenclosed.\n28\n\n29\\. The legal interest for money lent (is at the rate of) five Mashas a month\nfor twenty (Karshapa _n_ as). 29\n\np. 242\n\n30\\. Some (declare, that this rate should not be paid) longer than a year. 30\n\n31\\. If (the loan) remains outstanding for a long time, the principal may be\ndoubled (after which interest ceases). 31\n\n32\\. A loan secured by a pledge that is used (by the creditor) bears no\ninterest; 32\n\n33\\. Nor money tendered, nor (a debt due by a debtor) who is forcibly\nprevented (from paying). 33\n\n34\\. (Special forms of interest are) compound interest, periodical interest,\n34\n\n35\\. Stipulated interest, corporal interest, daily interest, and the use of a\npledge. 35\n\np. 243\n\n36\\. The interest on products of animals, on wool, on the produce of a field,\nand on beasts of burden (shall) not (increase) more than the fivefold (value\nof the object lent). 36\n\n37\\. The property of (a person who is) neither an idiot nor a minor, having\nbeen used by strangers before his eyes for ten years, (belongs) to him who\nuses it, 37\n\n38\\. (But) not (if it is used) by _S_ rotriyas, ascetics, or royal officials.\n38\n\n39\\. Animals, land, and females are not lost (to the owner) by (another\'s)\npossession. 39\n\np. 244\n\n40\\. The heirs shall pay the debts (of a deceased person). 40\n\n41\\. Money due by a surety, a commercial debt, a fee (due to the parents of\nthe bride), debts contracted for spirituous liquor or in gambling, and a fine\nshall not involve the sons (of the debtor). 41\n\n42\\. An (open) deposit, a sealed deposit, an object lent for use, an object\nbought (but not paid), and a pledge, being lost without the fault of the\nholder, (shall not involve) any blameless person. 42\n\n43\\. A man who has stolen (gold) shall approach the king, with flying hair,\nholding a club in his hand, and proclaim his deed. 43\n\np. 245\n\n44\\. Whether he be slain or be pardoned, he is purified (of his guilt).\n\n45\\. If the king does not strike, the guilt falls on him. 45\n\n46\\. Corporal punishment (must) not (be resorted to in the case) of a Brahma\n_n_ a. 46\n\n47\\. Preventing (a repetition of) the deed, publicly proclaiming his crime,\nbanishment, and branding (are the punishments to which a Brahma _n_ a, may be\nsubjected). 47\n\n48\\. That (king) who does not do his duty (by inflicting punishment) becomes\nliable to perform a penance. 48\n\n49\\. (A man who) knowingly (becomes) the servant (of a thief shall be treated)\nlike a thief, 49\n\n50\\. Likewise he who (knowingly) receives (goods) from (a thief or) an\nunrighteous man.\n\n51\\. The award of the punishment (must be regulated) by a consideration (of\nthe status) of the criminal, of his (bodily) strength, of (the nature of) the\ncrime, and whether the offence has been repeated. 51\n\n52\\. Or a pardon (may be given) in accordance with the opinion of an\nassemblage of persons learned in the Vedas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[238:1](sbe0276.htm#fr_1155) **XII**. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 27, 14; Manu VIII,\n270, 279-283; p. 239 Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 215. Haradatta adds that an\nabusive word or a blow given in jest must not be punished in the manner\nprescribed above, as the word \'parushya\' presupposes criminal intent.\n\n[239:2](sbe0276.htm#fr_1156) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 26, 20; Mayukha XIX, 7, where,\nhowever, arya has been altered to a _k_ arya. Haradatta adds that the two\npunishments are cumulative in the case of a Brahma _n_ i only. If the offence\nis committed with a Kshatriya, the offender is liable to the first only; if he\nsins with a Vai _s_ ya, to the second.\n\n[239:3](sbe0276.htm#fr_1157) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 27, 9; Manu VIII, 359; Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 286.\n\n[239:7](sbe0276.htm#fr_1158) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 27, 15; Manu VIII, 281.-The\ntranslation follows Haradatta, who is guided by the parallel passages. But for\nthe latter, one would translate \'he shall be fined.\'\n\n[239:8](sbe0276.htm#fr_1159) Manu VIII, 267; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 204-207.\nManu VIII, 136 states one Karshapa _n_ a or copper Pa _n_ a contains 80\nRaktikas, which would correspond to 97-60 grammes of the metrical system.\n\n[240:10](sbe0276.htm#fr_1160) Manu VIII, 267.\n\n[240:11](sbe0276.htm#fr_1161) Manu VIII, 268.\n\n[240:12](sbe0276.htm#fr_1162) Manu VIII, 268.\n\n[240:13](sbe0276.htm#fr_1163) Manu VIII, 268. Haradatta adds that, as a Brahma\n_n_ a is declared to pay nothing for abusing a _S_ udra, a Kshatriya and a Vai\n_s_ ya are liable to be fined for that offence, and that according to U _s_\nanas a Kshatriya shall pay twenty-four Pa _n_ as, and a Vai _s_ ya thirty-six.\n\n[240:14](sbe0276.htm#fr_1164) I.e. a Vai _s_ ya shall pay one hundred Pa _n_\nas for abusing a Kshatriya, and a Kshatriya fifty for abusing a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n[240:15](sbe0276.htm#fr_1165) Manu VIII, 337.\n\n[240:16](sbe0276.htm#fr_1166) Manu VIII, 337-338. I.e. a Vai _s_ ya is to pay\nsixteen times the value of the stolen property, a Kshatriya thirty-two times,\nand a Brahma _n_ a sixty-four times.\n\n[240:17](sbe0276.htm#fr_1167) Manu VIII, 338.\n\n[240:18](sbe0276.htm#fr_1168) Manu VIII, 330. K _ri_ sh _n_ ala is another\nname for Raktika, p. 241 used also by Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 362. It equals\n0.122 grammes of the metrical system, Prinsep, Useful Tables, p. 97.\n\n[241:20](sbe0276.htm#fr_1169)-21. Manu VIII, 240; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 162.\n\n[241:22](sbe0276.htm#fr_1170)-26. Manu VIII, 241; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II,\n159-161; Colebrooke III, Digest IV, 40. Haradatta, relying on U _s_ anas\neverywhere, reckons twenty Mashas to the Karshapa _n_ a.\n\n[241:27](sbe0276.htm#fr_1171) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 11, 27, 18.\n\n[241:28](sbe0276.htm#fr_1172) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 10, 28, 3; Colebrooke III, Digest\nIV, 22.\n\n[241:29](sbe0276.htm#fr_1173) Manu VIII, 140; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 37;\nColebrooke I, Digest 25. Haradatta states that a Karshapa _n_ a contains\ntwenty p. 242 Mashas. Thus the monthly interest for 400 Mashas being five\nMashas, the rate is 1\xc2\xbc per cent for the month, or 15 per cent per annum.\n\n[242:30](sbe0276.htm#fr_1174) Colebrooke I, Digest 40; Manu VIII, 153.\n\n[242:31](sbe0276.htm#fr_1175) Manu VIII, 151; Colebrooke I, Digest 59.\n\n[242:32](sbe0276.htm#fr_1176) Manu VIII, 143; Colebrooke I, Digest 79.\n\n[242:33](sbe0276.htm#fr_1177) Colebrooke I, Digest 79. \'Likewise the debt of a\ndebtor who, being desirous to pay, is imprisoned by the king or others in a\nprison or the like, and who is thus unable to pay, does not increase from that\nday.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[242:34](sbe0276.htm#fr_1178) For this and the next Sutra, see also Colebrooke\nI, Digest 35-45, in the notes on which latter text the various explanations of\nthese terms, found here, have been fully discussed. \'If a large or a small\ninterest is taken on condition that the loan is to be repaid on a certain\ndate, and that, in case of non-payment, \'it is to be trebled or quadrupled,\nthat is called periodical interest\'--Haradatta.\n\n[242:35](sbe0276.htm#fr_1179) \'Where the lender and the borrower, having\nregard to the country, the time, the object, and the condition (of the\nborrower), agree between themselves (on a certain Tate), e.g. of ten per cent\nper mensem, that is called stipulated interest. Corporal interest is that\nwhich is payable by bodily labour. Thus B _ri_ haspati says, "Corporal\ninterest is that connected with work." But Vyasa explains it thus, "Corporal\ninterest is that which arises from the work (or use) of a (pledged female\nquadruped) to be p. 243 milked, or of (a male) to carry burdens." Katyayana\nexplains the daily interest (lit. the interest resembling the growth of the\nlock on the head), "That which is taken daily is called daily interest." . . .\n\'E.g. for a Prastha of grain lent a handful of grain is taken daily.\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[243:36](sbe0276.htm#fr_1180) Colebrooke I, Digest 62. Haradatta mentions also\nanother explanation of the Sutra: \'Another (commentator) says, " If products\nof animals and the rest have been bought, and the price is not paid at once,\nthat may increase fivefold by the addition of interest, but not, to a greater\nsum."\'\n\n[243:37](sbe0276.htm#fr_1181) Manu VIII, 147-148; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 24.\n\n[243:38](sbe0276.htm#fr_1182) Haradatta adds that in the case of a _S_ rotriya\nand of an ascetic, the owner may allow the use of his property for a long\ntime, desiring to acquire merit by doing so, and that fear may prevent him\nfrom opposing the king\'s servants. Hence prolonged possession by such persons\ndoes not necessitate the conclusion that the owner had given up his rights. As\nascetics cannot possess any property, the Sutra must refer to their occupying\nan empty house which has an owner.\n\n[243:39](sbe0276.htm#fr_1183) Manu VIII, 149; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 25. The\ntranslation given above agrees with an explanation of the Sutra which\nHaradatta mentions, but rejects. He himself prefers the following: \'Animals,\ni.e. quadrupeds; land, i.e. a field, a garden, and the like; females, i.e.\nfemale slaves and the like. No long possession of animals and the rest is\nnecessary in order to acquire the rights of ownership over them. Even after a\nshort period they become the property of the possessor. For how (would it be\npossible that) a person, who himself wants butter-milk and the like, should\nallow a cow which he himself has bought, and which gives daily a Drona of\nmilk, to be milked in the house of another person?\' &c. &c.\n\n[244:40](sbe0276.htm#fr_1184) Manu VIII, 162; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 51.\n\n[244:41](sbe0276.htm#fr_1185) Manu VIII, 159-160; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 47,\n54; Colebrooke I, Digest 202. Taking into account the parallel passages of\nManu and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, Haradatta very properly restricts this rule to a\nbail for the personal appearance of an offender. In explanation of the\nexpression \'a commercial debt\' he gives the following instance: \'If a person\nhas borrowed money from somebody on the condition that he is to repay the\nprincipal together with the gain thereon, and if he dies in a foreign country,\nwhile travelling in order to trade, then that money shall not be repaid by the\nson.\' The instance explaining the term \'fee\' ( _s_ ulka) is as follows: \'If a\nperson has promised a fee (to the parents of a woman) and dies after the\nwedding, then that fee does not involve his son, i.e. need not be paid by\nhim.\' The word _s_ ulka is, however, ambiguous, and may also mean \'a tax or\ntoll.\'\n\n[244:42](sbe0276.htm#fr_1186) Manu VIII, 189; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 59-66;\nColebrooke II, Digest I, 29. Haradatta declares the meaning to be, that in\ncase the bailee was guilty of no negligence and took the same care of the\ndeposits &c. as of his own property, neither he nor his heirs need make good\nthe value of those which were lost or destroyed.\n\n[244:43](sbe0276.htm#fr_1187) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 4.\n\n[245:45](sbe0276.htm#fr_1188) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 251, 5.\n\n[245:46](sbe0276.htm#fr_1189) Manu VIII, 124; Macnaghten, Mitakshara III, 4,\n9.\n\n[245:47](sbe0276.htm#fr_1190) Manu IX, 239, 241; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 27, 8,\n17-19; Macnaghten loc. cit. Karmaviyoga, \'preventing (a repetition of) the\ndeed,\' may also mean \'suspension from (his priestly) functions.\'\n\n[245:48](sbe0276.htm#fr_1191) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 11, 28, 13.\n\n[245:49](sbe0276.htm#fr_1192)-50.
