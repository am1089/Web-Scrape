XXX.\n\nKrishn\xcc\x81a restores her earrings to Aditi, and is praised by her: he visits the\ngardens of Indra, and at the desire of [Satyabhama](errata.htm#25) carries off\nthe Parijata tree. \xc5\x9aachi excites Indra to its rescue. Conflict between the\ngods and Krishn\xcc\x81a, who defeats them. Satyabhama derides them. They praise\nKrishn\xcc\x81a.\n\nGARUD\xcc\x81A, laden with the umbrella of Varun\xcc\x81a and the jewel mountain, and\nbearing Hrishike\xc5\x9ba on his back to the court of Indra, went lightly, as if in\nsport, along. When they arrived at the portals of Swarga, Hari blew his shell;\non which the gods advanced to meet him, bearing respectful offerings. Having\nreceived the homage of the divinities, Krishn\xcc\x81a went to the palace of the\nmother of the gods, whose turrets resembled white clouds; and on beholding\nAditi, paid his respects to her, along with \xc5\x9aakra; and, presenting to her her\nown earrings, informed her of the destruction of the demon Naraka. The mother\nof the world, well pleased, then fixed her whole thoughts upon Hari, the\ncreator, and thus pronounced his praise: "Glory to thee, O god with the lotus\neyes, who removest all fear from those that worship thee. Thou art the\neternal, universal, and living soul; the origin of all beings; the instigator\nof the mental faculty, and faculties of sense; one with the three qualities;\nbeyond the three qualities; exempt from contraries; pure; existing in the\nhearts of all; void of colour, extension, and every transient modification;\nunaffected by the vicissitudes of birth or death, sleep or waking. Thou art\nevening, night, and day; earth, sky, air, water, and fire; mind, intellect,\nand individuality. Thou art the agent of creation, duration, and dissolution;\nthe master over the agent; in thy forms which are called Brahma, Vishn\xcc\x81u, and\n\xc5\x9aiva. Thou art gods, Yakshas, Daityas, Rakshasas, Siddhas, Punnagas,\nKushman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as, Pi\xc5\x9bachas, Gandharbas, men, animals, deer, elephants, reptiles,\ntrees, shrubs, creepers, climbers, and grasses; all things, large, middling,\nsmall, immense, or minute: thou art all bodies whatsoever, composed of\naggregated atoms. This thy illusion beguiles all who are ignorant of thy true\nnature, the fools who imagine soul to be in that which is not spirit. The\nnotions that "I am--this is mine," which influence mankind, are but the\ndelusions of the mother of\n\np. 585\n\nthe world, originating in thy active agency. Those men who, attentive to their\nduties, diligently worship thee, traverse all this illusion, and obtain\nspiritual freedom. Brahma and all the gods, men and animals, are alike\ninvested by the thick darkness of fascination, in the gulf of the illusions of\nVishn\xcc\x81u. That men, who having worshipped thee, should seek the gratification\nof their desires, and their own preservation, this, O lord, is also thy\ndelusion. It is the sport of thy fascinations that induces men to glorify\nthee, to obtain thereby the continuance of their race, or the annihilation of\ntheir enemies, instead of eternal liberation. It is the fault of the impure\nacts of the unrighteous (to proffer such idle requests to one able to confer\nsuch more important benefits), like asking for a rag to cover one\'s nakedness\nfrom the tree that bestows whatever is solicited. Be propitious then,\nimperishable author of all the error that deceives the world; and dispel, O\nlord of all creatures, the conceit of knowledge, which proceeds from\nignorance. Glory to thee, grasper of the discus, wielder of the bow,\nbrandisher of the mace, holder of the shell; for such do I behold thee in thy\nperceptible form: nor do I know that form of thine, which is beyond\nperception! Have compassion on me, supreme god."\n\nVishn\xcc\x81u, thus hymned by Aditi, smiled, and said to the mother of the gods,\n"Mother goddess, do thou shew favour unto me, and grant me thy blessing." "So\nbe it," replied Aditi, "ever as thou wilt; and whilst thou dwellest amongst\nmortals, the first of men, thou shalt be invincible by gods or demons." Then\nSatyabhama, accompanied by the queen of Indra, addressed Aditi respectfully,\nand solicited her benedictions: and Aditi in reply said to her, "Fair-browed\ndame, thou shalt never suffer decay, nor loss of beauty: thou shalt be the\nasylum of all loveliness, dame of faultless shape." With the assent of Aditi,\nIndra then respectfully saluted Janarddana in all due form, and conducted him\nand Satyabhama through Nandana and other pleasant gardens of the gods; where\nKe\xc5\x9bava, the destroyer of Ke\xc5\x9bi, saw the Parijata tree, the favourite of \xc5\x9aachi,\nwhich was produced when the ocean was churned for ambrosia: the bark was of\ngold, and it was embellished with young sprouting leaves of a copper colour,\nand fruit-stalks bearing numerous clusters of fragrant fruit.\n\np. 586\n\n[paragraph continues] When Satyabhama noticed this tree, she said to her\nbeloved lord, Govinda, "Why should not this divine tree be transported to\nDwaraka? If what you say is true, and I am really dear to you, then let this\ntree be taken away from hence, and planted in the gardens of my dwelling. You\nhave often said to me, \'Neither Jambavati nor Rukmini is so dear to me, Satya,\nas you are.\' If you have spoken the truth, and not mere flattery, then let\nthis Parijata tree be the ornament of my mansion. I long to shine amidst my\nfellow queens, wearing the flowers of this tree in the braids of my hair."\n\nThus solicited by Satyabhama, Hari smiled upon her, and taking the Parijata\nplant, put it upon Garud\xcc\x81a. The keepers of the garden remonstrated, and said,\n"This Parijata tree belongs to \xc5\x9aachi, the queen of the sovereign of the gods:\nit is not proper, Govinda, for you to remove it. At the time when the ocean\nwas churned for the beverage of immortality, this tree was produced, for the\npurpose of providing \xc5\x9aachi with flowery ornaments. You cannot be suffered to\ndepart with it. It is through ignorance that this is sought for by any one, as\nit is the especial property of her on whose countenance the king of the gods\ndelights to look; and who shall go away with impunity, who attempts to carry\nit off? Assuredly the king of the gods will punish this audacity; for his hand\nlaunches the thunderbolt, and the immortals attend upon his steps. Forbear\nthen, Krishn\xcc\x81a, nor provoke the hostility of all the gods. The wise will not\ncommence actions that can be productive only of unpleasant consequences."\nSatyabhama, on hearing these words, was exceedingly offended, and said, "What\nright has \xc5\x9aachi\\--what has Indra--to the Parijata tree? it was produced at the\nchurning of the ocean as the common property of all worlds. Wherefore, gods,\nshould Indra alone possess it? In the same manner, guardians of the grove, as\nnectar, as the moon, as the goddess \xc5\x9ari herself, so the Parijata tree is the\ncommon property of all the world: and since \xc5\x9aachi, confiding in the strength\nof her husband\'s arm, would keep it to herself, away with submission to her:\nSatya takes away the tree. Go quickly, and let Paulomi be told what I have\nsaid: repeat to her this contemptuous message from Satyabhama; \'If you are the\nbeloved wife of your lord, if your husband is\n\np. 587\n\nobedient to your authority, let him prevent my husband from carrying off this\ntree. I know your husband \xc5\x9aakra; I know the sovereign of the divinities; and\nI, who am a mortal, take this Parijata tree away from you.\'"\n\nAccordingly the warders of the garden went and reported to \xc5\x9aachi the message\nof Satyabhama. \xc5\x9aachi appealed to her husband, and excited the king of the gods\nto resent this affront: and Indra accordingly, attended by the army of the\ncelestials, marched to attack Hari, in defence of the Parijata tree. The gods\nwere armed with clubs, swords, maces, and darts; and Indra wielded the\nthunderbolt. As soon as Govinda saw the king of the gods advancing against him\non his elephant, attended by the immortals, he blew his shell so that the\nsound filled all the regions, and he showered smilingly myriads of arrows upon\nhis assailants. Beholding the air in all directions overspread with his darts,\nthe celestials in return hurled innumerable missiles; but every one of these\nthe destroyer of Madhu, and lord of all worlds, cut playfully into a thousand\npieces with his shafts. The devourer of serpents, Garud\xcc\x81a, laid hold of the\nnoose of the sovereign of the waters, and tore it to fragments with his beak,\nas if it had been a little snake. The son of Devaki threw his mace at the club\nof Yama, and cast it broken upon the ground: he cut in bits the litter of the\nlord of wealth with his discus: a glance of his eye eclipsed the radiance of\nthe sun: he severed Agni into a hundred parts with his arrows, and scattered\nthe Vasus through the realms of space: with his discus he cut off the points\nof the tridents of the Rudras, and cast themselves upon the earth: and with\nthe shafts shot from his bow he dispersed the Sadhyas, Vi\xc5\x9bwas, Maruts, and\nGandharbas, like fleeces of cotton from the pods of the Simel tree, through\nthe sky. Garud\xcc\x81a also diligently plied his beak and wings and nails, and bit\nand bruised and scratched the deities who opposed his lord.\n\nThen the king of the gods and the foe of Madhu encountered and overwhelmed\neach other with countless shafts, like rain-drops falling from two heavy\nclouds. Garud\xcc\x81a in the conflict engaged with Airavata, and Janarddana was\nopposed to all the deities. When all the other weapons had been cut to pieces,\nIndra stood armed with his thunderbolt,\n\np. 588\n\nand Krishn\xcc\x81a with the discus Sudar\xc5\x9bana. Beholding them thus prepared for\nfight, all the people of the three spheres exclaimed, "Alas! alas!" Indra\nlaunched his bolt, but in vain, for Hari caught and arrested it: he forbore,\nhowever, to hurl his discus, and only called out to Indra to stay. Satyabhama\nseeing Indra disarmed, and his elephant disabled by Garud\xcc\x81a, and the deity\nhimself about to retreat, said to him, "King of the triple sphere, it ill\nbecomes the husband of \xc5\x9aachi to run away. Ornamented with Parijata garlands,\nshe will approach you. Of what use is the sovereignty of heaven, embellished\nwith the Parijata tree, no longer beholding \xc5\x9aachi meet you with affection as\nof yore? Nay, \xc5\x9aakra, fly not; you must not suffer shame: here, take the\nParijata tree; let the gods be no longer annoyed. Sachs, inflated with pride\nof her husband, has not welcomed me to her dwelling with respectful presents.\nAs a woman, I am light of purpose, and am anxious for my husband\'s fame;\ntherefore have I instigated, \xc5\x9aakra, this contest with you. But I do not want\nthe Parijata tree, nor do I wish to take that which is another\'s property.\n\xc5\x9aachi is proud of her beauty. What woman is not proud of her husband?" Thus\nspoken to by Satyabhama, the king of the gods turned back, and said to her,\n"Desist, wrathful dame, from afflicting your friend by further reproaches. I\nam not ashamed of being vanquished by him who is the author of the creation,\npreservation, and destruction of the world; who is the substance of all\nthings; in whom, without beginning or middle, the universe is comprised; and\nfrom whom, and by whom, identical with all things, it proceeds, and will cease\nto be. What disgrace is it, O goddess, to any one to be discomfited by him who\nis the cause of creation, continuance, and dissolution? His form is the parent\nof all worlds, though infinitely subtle, and known to those only by whom all\nthat may be known is known. Who is able to overcome the unborn, unconstituted,\neternal lord, who has willed to become a mortal for the good of the world 1?"\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[588:1](vp147.htm#fr_1550) The Bhagavata merely says, "Incited by his wife,\nKrishn\xcc\x81a took away the Parijata tree, having subdued the gods, and planted it\nin the garden of Satyabhama." The Hari V. makes a long story of it, and tells\nit with some variations, especially in the commencement; Satyabhama\'s desire\nfor the Parijata tree having been excited by Narada\'s presenting a flower from\nit to Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s other spouse, Rukmini.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXI](vp148.htm)\n\n'
