From the time the promise was made, the cowherdesses,\nentertaining a hope of its accomplishment, and of engaging in festive songs\nand dances with Krishnu, became dispirited in mind, and constantly endeavoured\nto propitiate the month of Kartik. By lucky accident, while they were engaged\nin propitiation, the pleasure-giving season, including Assin and Kartik came.\n\nFrom the time the month of Kartik commenced, heat, cold and rain were\ndestroyed. Tanks were filled with pure water. Lotuses flourished in full\nbloom. The white lotus, partridge and loving couples are filled with delight\non beholding the moon at night. The female ruddy goose is dirty, and the lotus\nwithered, who regard the sun as friendly to them.\n\nShree Shookdeo, the sage, then said,--O lord of the earth! Shree Krishnu Chund\nhaving come forth on the night of the full moon in the month of Kartik, saw\nthe stars scattered in the\n\np. 99\n\nsky--the light of the moon was spread abroad on all sides, a cool, fragrant,\ngentle breeze was blowing; and on one side a thick forest of great beauty\nexhibited its many ornaments. Beholding such a scene it came into his mind,\nthat he had made a promise to the cowherdesses to engage in festive songs and\ndances with them in the season, comprising the month of Assin and Kartik, and\nthat it was necessary for him to fulfil this promise. Thinking of this, and\ncoming to the jungle, Krishnu played upon the flute. Having heard the notes of\nthe flute, all the young women of Bruj, who were filled with desire of\nKrishnu, on account of their separation from him, were very much frightened.\nAt length having laid aside all feeling for kindred and family modesty,\nabandoning their household occupations, they put on their ornaments and came\nforth in the greatest confusion. One cowherdess, in attempting to go off, was\nstopped by her husband on the road, who brought her back home, and would not\nallow her to go. Upon this she meditated upon Huri, and having quitted her\nbody arrived before them all. Shree Krishnu Chund having seen her affection\nimmediately granted her deliverance of the soul from the body, and exemption\nfrom further transmigration.\n\nAt this point of the history, Raja Pureechit said to Shree Shookdeo Jee,--"O\nlord of kindness! the cowherdess did not esteem and regard Shree Krishnu Jee\nas the deity, but merely as an object of sense, for which she felt desire in\nher mind; how came it to pass that she obtained this state of deliverance and\nexemption? Please explain this to me, that the doubts of my mind may\ndisappear?" The sage replied, O incarnation of justice! even mortals, who\nwithout knowledge celebrate the greatness of Shree Krishnu Chund, obtain\nwithout doubt this religious deliverance and exemption. Just as a man who\ndrinks the water of life without knowing it, will be immortal; in like manner\nhe who knowingly drinks it, will derive full benefit from its excellent\nqualities. All men are aware, that the virtues and benefits of blessings\n\np. 100\n\nmust manifest themselves. And the same holds good with reference to the glory\nof the adoration of Huri. In whatever manner a man may worship him, he will\nobtain deliverance. Muttering prayers, rosaries, sectarial marks on the body\nand forehead, are all utterly useless and unprofitable, if the mind is\nwavering and infirm. But if the mind be true, Ram is pleased with them. And I\nwill explain the various ways, in which different persons have acknowledged\nShree Krishnu, and obtained deliverance. Nund and Jusodha looked upon him as\ntheir son; the cowherdesses as their gallant; Kuns worshipped him through\nfear; the cowherds\' children prayed to him as their friend; the Pandoos\nregarded him as their most dearly loved; Sissoopal acknowledged him as an\nenemy. The descendants of Judoo made him one of their own family --and jogees,\nand devotees with long hair, and sages meditated on him as the deity. But in\nthe end, all obtained the blessing of deliverance and exemption. What reason\nis there for wonder that a single cowherdess should have obtained this\nblessing by meditating on Krishnu?\n\nHaving heard this explanation, Raja Pureechit said to Shree Shookdeo, the\nsage, "O lord of favour! my doubts have vanished: do me the kindness to\nproceed now with the narrative."\n\nShree Shookdeo said,--O great king! The meeting of the cowherdesses with\nKrishnu, the light of the world, and sea of beauty, to meet whom they rushed\nforth in crowds, may be compared to the violent rushing of rivers in the rains\nto mix with the sea.\n\nThe splendid manner in which Shree Krishnu was decorated, baffles description.\nOrnamented from head to foot, and in the guise of a juggler, he appeared so\nfascinating, beautiful and elegant, that the women of Bruj were lost in\ndelight at beholding his splendid appearance. Mohan, having enquired after\ntheir health, asked them in a rather dry, rough manner, "Whether they had been\nvery much frightened travelling at night, when\n\np. 101\n\ngoblins and spirits appear abroad, over a dreadful road, and with all their\nclothes and ornaments put on in the greatest disorder?\n\n"How did you come to this immense forest, abandoning all affection for your\nrelatives and family? Such obstreperous, violent conduct is unbecoming in\nwomen. It is said, that a wife should perform her duties with strict obedience\nto her husband, whoever he may be; whether she marry one who is a coward,\nwicked, foolish, deceitful, ugly, a leper, one-eyed, blind, decrepit, lame or\npoor. From acting thus, her welfare and reputation in the world are derived.\nIt is the highest excellence in a high-born, chaste woman not to leave her\nhusband for a second. And the wife, who having abandoned her own husband, goes\nto another, obtains in each birth a residence in the regions below." Krishnu\nadded, "You have come here and seen the thick forests, pure moonlight, and the\nbeautiful banks of the Jumna; you had better now return home, and minister\naffectionately to your husbands."\n\nOn hearing these words from the mouth of Shree Krishnu, all the cowherdesses\nat once lost their reason, and were overwhelmed with the boundless sea of\nthought. Afterwards they looked down, and heaved deep sighs, and dug up the\nearth with their toes. The tears, which streamed from their eyes, were like\nthe falling pearls of a broken necklace.\n\nAt length being much depressed with grief, they said weeping to Krishnu, "You\nare a great impostor; first of all by playing on the flute you stole away,\nunawares, our mind and thoughts, now being altogether without compassion, and\npractising deceit, you wish to destroy us by harsh speeches." Again they said,\n"We have left our families, relatives, homes, husbands, and have put out of\nour minds the reproach of our relations, to which our conduct has exposed us.\nWe are deprived of our husbands: there is no one to protect us. Grant us an\nasylum, O lord of Bruj! persons who live under your protection, desire not\nwealth, corporal form,\n\np. 102\n\nmodesty or greatness. You are their lord in each successive birth, O god, in\nthe form of life! To what home shall we go: our souls are wrapped up in\naffection for you."\n\nOn hearing these words, Shree Krishnu smiled, and calling the cowherdesses\nsaid to them, "If you really have such great affection for me, engage with me\nin festive songs and dances."\n\nOn hearing these words, the cowherdesses abandoned all grief, and gathered\nround him with delight from all sides, and began to feast their eyes with\nbeholding the face of Krishnu.\n\nThe cloud-coloured Krishnu stood in the midst; and the women, engaged in\ndiversions, appeared like golden creepers, growing from under a dark-coloured\nhill. Shree Krishnu had before intimated to his delusive power, that he would\nengage in festivities, and had ordered the power to raise a fine building,\nremain in it, and grant all the desires and wishes, which any one might form.\n\nO great king! the delusive power, on hearing the order, went to the banks of\nthe Jumna, and having made a large, round golden terrace, studded with pearls\nand diamonds, and surrounded it on all sides with pillars of sprouting\nplantains, in which were wreaths and garlands of flowers of all kinds, came\nand informed Shree Krishnu Chund of what he had done. He was delighted at\nhearing it, and taking all the women of Bruj with him, went to the banks of\nthe Jumna.\n\nOn arrival, they saw that the splendour of the circular terrace, which had\nbeen made for their festivities, was four times more brilliant than the moon\'s\norb. The sand, which surrounded it, appeared like the light of the moon. There\nwas a fragrant, cool, sweet breeze blowing. And on one side the verdure of all\nthe forests displayed its numerous beauties in the brightness of the night.\n\nOn viewing this scene the cowherdesses were highly pleased, and having gone to\nthe bank of a tank, named Manusrowur, which was near the terrace, and putting\non pleasing, elegant dresses and ornaments, adorning themselves from head to\nfoot,\n\np. 103\n\nthey brought sweet-toned lutes, timbrels and other musical instruments; and\nbeing intoxicated with love, abandoning all reflection and modesty, they began\nto play, sing and dance with Krishnu. At that time, Shree Gobind, in the\nassembly of cowherdesses, appeared as beautiful as the moon amidst stars.\n\nHaving recited so much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king!\nwhen the cowherdesses, having utterly abandoned reason, looked upon Huri in\nthe course of their festivities, as their natural husband, and considered him\nas subservient to themselves. Shree Krishnu Chund reflected in his mind,--"The\ncowherdesses now think me in their power, and regard me, in their minds, as\ntheir natural lord; they have become ignorant, abandoning all modesty, and\ntwine themselves round my neck, and embrace me with great affection; they have\nall utterly forgotten knowledge and meditation; I will now leave them, as they\nhave increased their pride; I will see what they will do, and how they will\nlive without me in the jungle." Having thus reflected, and taken Shree Radhika\nwith him, Shree Krishnu Chund disappeared.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXI](psa32.htm)\n\n'
