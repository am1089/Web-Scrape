Himalaya said:--"O Mahes\'vari! Now tell me the Yoga with all its Amgas\n(limbs) giving the knowledge of the Supreme Consciousness so that, I may\nrealise my Self, when I practise according to those instruetions.\n\n2-10. S\'ri Devi said:--"The Yoga does not exist in the Heavens; nor does it\nexist on earth or in the nether regions (Patala). Those who are skilled in the\nYogas say that the realisation of the identity between the Jivatma and the\nParamatma is "Yoga." O Sinless One! The enemies to this Yoga are six; and they\nare last, anger, greed, ignorance, vanity and jealousy. The Yogis attain the\nYoga when they become able to destroy these six enemies by practising the\naccompaniments to Yoga. Yama, Niyama, \xc3\x82sana, Pra _n_ ayama, Pratyahara, Dhara\n_n_ a, Dhyana, and Samadhi, these are the eight limbs of Yoga. Yama includes\nAhimsa (non-injuring; non- killing); truthfulness; Asteyam (non-stealing by\nmind or deed) Brahmacharya (continence); Daya (mercy to all beings);\nUprightness; forgiveness, steadiness; eating frugally, restrictedly and\ncleanliness (external and internal). These are ten in number. Niyama includes\nalso ten qualities:--(1) Tapasya (austerities and penances); (2) contentment;\n(3) \xc3\x82stikya (faith in the God and the Vedas, Devas, Dharma and Adharma) (4)\nCharity (in good causes); worship of God; hearing the Siddhantas (established\nsayings) of the Yedas; Hri or modesty (not to do any irreligious or blameable\nacts); S\'raddha (faith to go do good works that are sanctioned); (9) Japam\n(uttering silently the mantrams, Gayatris or sayings of Puranas) and (10)\nHomam (offering oblations daily to the Sacred Fire). There are five kinds of\nAsanas (Postures) that are commendable: Padmasan, Svastikasan, Bhadrasan,\nVajrasan and Virasan. Padmasan consists in crossing the legs and placing the\nfact on the opposite thighs (the right foot on the left thigh and the left\nfoot on the right thigh) and catching by the right hand brought round the\nback, the toes of the right foot and catching by the left hand brought round\nthe back the toes of the left foot; sitting then straight and with ease. This\nis recommended by the Yogis (and by this one can raise oneself in the air).\n\nN. B.--The hands, according to some, need not be carried round the back; both\nthe hands are crossed and placed similarly on the thighs.\n\n11-20. Place the soles of the feet completely under the thighs, keep\n\np. 719\n\nthe body straight, and sit at ease. This is called the Svastikasan. Bhadrasan\nconsists in placing well the two heels on the two sides of the two nerves of\nthe testicle, near the anus and catching by the two hands the two heels at the\nlower part of the testicles and then sitting at ease. This is very much liked\nby the Yogis. Vajrasan (diamond seat) consists in placing the feet on the two\nthighs respectively and placing the fingers below the thighs with the hands\nalso there, and then sitting at ease. Virasan consists in sitting cross on the\nhams in placing the right foot under the right thigh and the left foot under\nthe left thigh and sitting at ease with body straight.\n\nTaking in the breath by the I _d_ a (the left nostril) so long as we count\n"Om" sixteen, retaining it in the Su _s_ umna so long as we count "Om" sixty-\nfour times and then exhaling it slowly by the Pingala na _d_ i (the right\nnostril) as long as we count "Om" thirty-two times. (The first process is\ncalled Puraka, the second is called Kumbhaka, and the third is called\nRechaka). This is called _one_ Pra _n_ ayama by those versed in the Yogas.\nThus one should go on again and again with his Pra _n_ ayama. At the very\nbeginning, try with the number twelve, _i. e._ , as we count "Om" twelve times\nand then increase the number gradually. to sixteen and so on. Pra _n_ ayama is\nof two kinds:--Sagarbha and Vigarbha. It is called Sagarbha when Pra _n_ ayama\nis performed with repeating the I _st_ a Mantra and Japam and meditation. It\nis called Vigarbha Pra _n_ ayama when "Om" is simply counted and no other\nMantram. When this Pra _n_ ayama is practised repeatedly, perspiration comes\nfirst when it is called of the lowest order; when the body begins to tremble,\nit is called middling; and when one rises up in the air, leaving the ground,\nit is called the best Pra _n_ ayama. (Therefore one who practises Pra _n_\nayama ought to continue it till he becomes able to rise in the air).\n\n21-30. Now comes Pratyahara. The senses travel spontaneously towards their\nobjects, as if they are without anyone tos check. To curb them perforce and to\nmake them turn backwards from those objects is called "Pratyahara," To hold\nthe Prana Vayu on toes, heels, knees, thighs, sacrum genital organs, navel,\nheart, neck, throat, the soft palate, nose, between the eyebrows, and on the\ntop of the head, at these twelve places respectively is called the "Dhara _n_\na." Concentrate the mind on the consciousness inside and then meditate the I\n_st_ a Devata within the Jivatma. This is the Dhyana. Samadhi is identifying\nalways the Jivatma and Paramatma. Thus the sages say,(Samadhi is of two kinds\n(1) Sampraj\xc3\xb1ata, or Savikalpak and (2) Nirvikalpak. When the ideas\n\np. 720\n\nthe Knower, Knowledge and the thing Known, rernain separate in the\ncopsciousness and yet the mind feels the one Akhan _d_ a Sachchidananda Brahma\nand his heart remains, there, that is called Sampraj _n_ ata Samadhi; and when\nthose three vanish away and the one Brahma remains, it is called Asamprajnata\nSamadhi). Thus I have described to you the Yoga with its eight limbs. O\nMountain! This body composed of the five elements, and with Jiva endowed with\nthe essence of the Sun the Moon, and the Fire and Brahma in it as one and the\nsame, is denominated by the term "Vis\'va." There are the 350,000 na _d_ is in\nthis body of man; of these, the principal are ten. Out of the ten again, the\nthree are most prominent. The foremost and first of these three is Susumna, of\nthe nature of the Moon, Sun, and Fire, situated in the centre of the spinal\ncord (it extends from the sacral plexus below to the Brahmaradhra in the head\nat the top where it looks like a blown Dhustura flower). On the left of this\nSu _s_ umna is the I _d_ a Na _d_ i, white and looking like Moon; this Na _d_\ni is of the nature of Force, nectar-like. On the right side of the Su _s_ umna\nis the Pingala Na _d_ i of the nature of a male; it represents the Sun. The Su\n_s_ umna comprises the nature of the all the Tejas (fires) and it represents\nFire.\n\n31-41. The inmost of Su _s_ umna is Vichtra or Chitri _n_ i Bhulingam na _d_ i\n(of the form of a cobweb) in the middle of which resides the Ichcha (will),\nJ\xc3\xb1ana (knowledge) and Kriya (action) S\'aktis, and resplendent like the\nMillions of Suns. Above Him is situated Hrim, the Maya Vija Haratma with "Ha"\nand Chandravindu repesenting the Sound (Nada). Above this is the Flame, Kula\nKu _n_ dalini (the Serpent Fire) of a red colour, and as it were, intoxicated.\nOutside Her is the \xc3\x82dhara Lotus of a yellow colour having a dimension of four\ndigits and Comprising the four letters "va", "s\'a", " _s_ a", and "sa". The\nYogis meditate on this. In its centre is the hexagonal space (Pi _t_ ham).\nThis is called the Muladhara for it is the base and it supparts all the six\nlotuses. Above it is the Svadhi _st_ hana Chakra, fiery and emitting lustre\nlike diamond and with six petals representing the six letters "ba", "bha",\n"ma", "ya", "ra", "la". The word "Sva" means "Param Lingam" (superior Male\nSymbol). Therefore the sages call this "Svadhi _st_ han Chakram. Above it is\nsituated the "Ma _n_ ipura Chakram" of the colour of lightning in clouds and\nvery fiery; it comprises the ten Petals, comprising the 10 letters _d_ a, _d_\nha, _n_ a, ta, _t_ ha, _d_ a, _d_ ha, _n_ a, pa, pha. The lotus resembles a\nfull blown pearl; hence it is "Ma _n_ ipadma." Vi _sn_ u dwells here.\nMeditation here leads to the sight of Vi _sn_ u, Above it is "Anahata" Padma\nwith the twelve petals representing, the twelve letters Ka, Kha, Gha, m###,\n(cha), (chha), (Ja), (Jha,) \xc3\x8eya, _t_ a, and _t_ ha. In the middle is\nBanalingam, resplendent like\n\np. 721\n\nthe Sun. This lotus emits the soutid S\'abda Brabma, without being struck;\ntherefore it is called the Anahata Lotus. This is the source of joy. Here\ndwalls Rudra, the Highest Person."\n\n42-43. Above it is situated the Vis\'uddha Chakra of the sixteen petals,\ncomprising the sixteen letters a, a, i, i, u, u, ri, _r_ i, li, lri, e, ai, o,\nar, am, a _h_. This is of a smoky colour, highly lustrous, and is situated in\nthe throat. The Jivatma sees the Paramatma (the Highest Self) here and it is\npurified; hence it is called Vis\'uddha. This wonderful lotus is termed \xc3\x82kas\'a.\n\n44-45. Above that is situated betwixt the eyebrows the excedingly beautiful\nAj\xc3\xb1a Chakra with two petals comprising the two letters "Ha," and K _s_ a. The\nSelf resides in this lotus. When persons are stationed here, they can see\neverything and know of the present, past and future. There one gets the\ncommands from the Highest Deity ( _e. g._ now this is for you to do and so\non); therefore it is called the Aj\xc3\xb1a Chakra.\n\n46.47. Above that is the Kailas\'a Chakra; over it is the Rodhi _n_ i Chikra. O\nOne of good vows! Thus I have described to you all about the \xc3\x82dhara Chakras.\nThe prominent Yogis say that above that again, is the Vindu Sthan, the seat of\nthe Supreme Deity with thousand petals. O Best of Mountains! Thus I declare\nthe best of the paths leading to Yoga.\n\n48\\. Now bear what is the next thing to do. First by the "Puraka", Pra _n_\nayama, fix the mind on the Muladhara Lotus. Then contract and arouse the Kula\nKu _nd_ alini S\'akti there, between the anus and the genital organs, by that\nVayu.\n\n49\\. Pieme, then, the Lingams (the lustrous Svayambhu \xc3\x82di Lingam) in the\nseveral Chakras above-mentioned and transfer along with it the heart united\nwith the S\'akti to the Sahasrara (the Thousand petalled Lotus). Then meditate\nthe S\'akti united with S\'ambhu there.\n\n50-51. There is produced in the Vindu Chakra, out of the intercourse of S\'iva\nand S\'akti, a kind of nectar-juice, resembling a sort of red-dye (lac). With\nthat Nectar of Joy, the wise Yogis make the Maya S\'akti, yielding successes in\nYoga, drink; then pleasing all the Devas in the six Chakras with the offerings\nof that Nectar, the Yogi brings the S\'akti down again on tho Muladhara Lotus.\n\np. 722\n\n52\\. Thus by daily practising this, all the above mantras will no doubt, be\nmade to come to complete success.\n\n53-54. And one will be free from this Samsara, filled with old age and death,\netc. O Lord of Mountains! I am the World Mother; My devotee will get all My\nqualities; there is no doubt in this. O Child! I have thus described to you\nthe excellent Yoga, holding the Vayu (Pavana Dhara _n_ a Yoga).\n\n55\\. Now hear from Me the Dhara _n_ a Yoga. To fix thoroughly one\'s heart on\nthe Supremely Lustrous Force of Mine, pervading all the quarters, countries,\nand all time leads soon to the union of the Jiva and the Brahma.\n\n56-58. If one does not quickly do this, owing to impurities of heart, then the\nYogi ought to adopt what is called the "Avayava Yoga." O Chief of Mountains!\nThe Sadhaka should fix his heart on my gentle hands, feet and other limbs one\nby one and try to conquer each of these places. Thereby his heart would be\npurified. Then he should fix that purified heart on My Whole Body.\n\n59-62. The practiser must practise with Japam and Homam the Mantram till his\nmind be not dissolved in Me, My Consciousness. By the practise of meditating\non the Mantra, the thing to be known (Brahma) is transformed into knowledge.\nKnow this as certain, that the Mantra is futile without Yoga and the Yoga is\nfutile without the Mantra. The Mantra and the Yoga are the two infalliable\nmeans to realise Brahma. As the jar in a dark room is visible by a lamp, so\nthis Jivatma, surrounded by Maya is visible by means of Mantra to the\nParamatma (the Highest Self). O Best of Mountains! Thus I have described to\nyou the Yogas with their A _n_ gas (limbs). You should receive instructions\nabout them from the mouth of a Gura; else millions of S\'astras will never be\nable to give you a true realisation of the meanings of the yogas.\n\nHere ends the Thirty-fifth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the Yoga and the\nMantra Siddhi in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXVI: On the Highest Knowledge of Brahma](dg06.htm)\n\n'
