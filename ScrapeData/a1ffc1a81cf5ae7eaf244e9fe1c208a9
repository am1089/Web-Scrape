Now, indeed, man (in) this (world) speaks an untruth, or sacrifices for\nmen unworthy to offer a sacrifice, or accepts what ought not to be accepted,\nor eats forbidden food, or practises what ought not to be practised. 1\n\np. 116\n\n2\\. They are in doubt if he shall perform a penance for such (a deed), or if\nhe shall not do it.\n\n3\\. (Some) declare that he shall not do it,\n\n4\\. Because the deed does not perish.\n\n5\\. (The correct view is, that) he shall perform (a penance), because it is\nenjoined in the revealed texts, 5\n\n6\\. \'He who offers a horse-sacrifice conquers all sin, he destroys the guilt\nof the murder of a Brahma _n_ a.\'\n\n7\\. (Moreover), \'Let an Abhi _s_ asta offer a Gosava or an Agnish _t_ ut-\nsacrifice,\'\n\n8\\. Reciting the Veda, austerity, a sacrifice, fasting, giving gifts are the\nmeans for expiating such a (blamable act).\n\n9\\. (The purificatory texts are) the Upanishads, the Vedantas, the Sa _m_\nhita-text of all the Vedas, the (Anuvakas called) Madhu, the (hymn of)\nAghamarsha _n_ a,  9\n\np. 117\n\nthe Atharva _s_ iras, the (Anuvakas called) Rudras, the Purusha-hymn, the two\nSamans called Ra _g_ a _n_ a and Rauhi _n_ eya, the Kushma _n_ _d_ as, the\nPavamanis, and the Savitri,\n\n10\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): \'He who performs once in each\nseason the offerings to Vai _s_ vanara and Vratapati and the Pavitresh _t_ i\nsanctifies ten ancestors.\' 10\n\n11\\. To live on milk alone, as if one were fasting, to eat fruit only, (to\nlive on) barley gruel prepared of a handful of grain, to eat gold, to drink\nSoma (are modes of subsistence which) purify. 11\n\n12\\. All mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, places of pilgrimage, the\ndwellings of _Ri_ shis, cowpens, and temples of the gods (are) places (which\ndestroy sin).\n\n13\\. A year, a month, twenty-four days, twelve days, six days, three days, a\nday and a night are the periods (for penances).\n\n14\\. These (acts) may be optionally performed when no (particular penance) has\nbeen prescribed,\n\n15\\. (Viz.) for great sins difficult (penances), and for trivial faults easy\nones.\n\n16\\. The K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra and the Atik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra (as well as) the _K_\nandraya _n_ a are penances for all (offences).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[115:1](sbe1425.htm#fr_636) **XXII**. As this chapter is almost identical with\nand probably copied from Baudhayana III, 10, and Gautama XIX, the division of\nthe Sutras has not been made in accordance with K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_\nita\'s commentary, but agrees with that of the chapter in Gautama\'s Dharma _s_\nastra. The notes to the translation of the p. 116 latter work must be\nconsulted for the explanation of the more difficult passages.\n\n[116:5](sbe1425.htm#fr_637)-7. The text appears here to be corrupt. After\nSutra 5, Baudhayana III, 10, 6 (Gautama XIX, 7), Puna _h_ stomena ya _g_ eta\npuna _h_ savanamayantiti vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ayate,\' It is declared in the Veda, "Let\nhim offer a Puna _h_ stoma-sacrifice, (those who offer it) again come to\npartake of (the libations of) Soma,"\' has been left out. This omission caused\nthe insertion of the words tasma _k_ _kh_ rutinidar _s_ anat [dar _s_ anat,\nBh. F.], (\'because it is enjoined in the revealed texts,\') at the end of Sutra\n5. The proof that the sixth Sutra of Baudhayana has been accidentally omitted\nis furnished by the fact That several MSS. of Vasish _th_ a read iti _k_ a\nafter yo \' _s_ vamedhena ya _g_ ate (Vas. XXII, 6). This _k_ a has no meaning,\nexcept if another Vedic passage preceded Sutra. 6. In order to escape this\ndifficulty, K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita writes yo \' _s_ vamedhena ya _g_ ata\niti, and begins the next Sutra with iti _k_ a, which he explains by\n\'moreover.\'\n\n[116:9](sbe1425.htm#fr_638) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita gives before\n\'Vedantas\' another word vedadaya _h_ , which he explains by \'the Vedas, Sm\n_ri_ tis, and Pura _n_ as.\'\n\n[117:10](sbe1425.htm#fr_639) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita takes the last word\nda _s_ apurusham to mean ten ancestors and ten descendants.\n\n[117:11](sbe1425.htm#fr_640) \'As if one were fasting,\' i.e. in small\nquantities.--K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXIII](sbe1426.htm)\n\n'
