And he saw the monk along in the dark night, sitting under the\ncemetery tree and looking down the road. He had made a magic circle with\nyellow powdered bones in a spot smeared with blood. In it he had put a jug\nfilled with blood and lamps with magic oil. He had kindled a fire and brought\ntogether the things he needed for worship.\n\nThe monk rose to greet the king who came carrying the body, and he said: "O\nKing, you have done me a great favour, and a hard one. This is a strange\nbusiness and a strange time and place for such as you. They say truly that you\nare the best of kings, for you serve others without thinking of yourself. This\nis the very thing that makes the greatness of a great man, when he does not\ngive a thing up, though it costs his very life."\n\nSo the monk felt sure the he was quite successful, and he took the body from\nthe king\'s shoulder. He bathed it and put garlands on it, and set it in the\nmiddle of the circle. Then he smeared his own body with ashes, put on a cord\nmade of human hair, wrapped himself in dead man\'s clothes, and stood a moment,\ndeep in thought. And the goblin was attracted by his thought into the body,\nand the monk worshipped him.\n\nFirst he offered liquor in a skull, then he gave him human teeth carefully\ncleaned, and human eyes and flesh. So he completed his worship, then he said\nto the king: "O King, fall flat on the ground before this master magician in\nan attitude of reverence, so that he may give you what you want."\n\nAnd the king remembered the words of the goblin. He said to the monk: "Holy\nsir, I do not know that attitude of reverence. Do you show me first, and\nafterwards I will do it in the same way."\n\nAnd when the monk fell on the ground to show the attitude of reverence, the\nking cut off his head with a sword, and cut out his heart and split it open.\nAnd he gave the head and the heart to the goblin.\n\nThen all the little gods were delighted and cried: "Well done!" And the goblin\nwas pleased and spoke to the king from the body he was living in: "O King,\nthis monk was trying to become king of the fairies. But you shall be that when\nyou have been king of the whole world."\n\nAnd the king answered the goblin: "O magic creature, if you are pleased with\nme, I have nothing more to wish for. Yet I ask you to make me one promise,\nthat these twenty-two different, charming puzzle-stories shall be known all\nover the world and be received with honour."\n\nAnd the goblin answered: "O King, so be it. And I will tell you something\nmore. Listen. When anyone tells or hears with proper respect even a part of\nthese puzzle-stories, he shall be immediately free from sin. And wherever\nthese stories are told, elves and giants and witches and goblins and imps\nshall have no power."\n\nThen the goblin left the dead body by magic, and went where he wanted to. Then\nShiva appeared there with all the little gods, and he was well pleased. When\nthe king bowed before him, he said: "My son, you did well to kill this sham\nmonk who tried by force to become king of the fairies. Therefore you shall\nestablish the whole earth, and then become king of the fairies yourself. And\nwhen you have long enjoyed the delights of heaven and at last give them up of\nyour own accord, then you shall be united with me. So receive from me this\nsword called Invincible. While you have it, everything you say will come\ntrue."\n\nSo Shiva gave him the magic sword, received his flowery words of worship, and\nvanished with the gods.\n\n'
