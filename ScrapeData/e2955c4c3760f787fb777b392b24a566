And once, O king! they happened to go,\nsurrounded by their people, and rejoicing, to a certain portion of the palace\nwhich resembled heaven. Then Ar _g_ una, the son of Pa _nd_ u, having surveyed\nwith delight that lovely palace, in the company of K _ri_ sh _n_ a, spoke\nthese words: 'O you of mighty arms! O you whose mother is Devaki 4! when the\nbattle was about to commence, I became aware of your greatness, and that\ndivine\n\np. 230\n\nform of yours 1. But that, O Kesava! which through affection (for me) you\nexplained before 2, has all disappeared, O tiger-like man! from my degenerate\nmind. Again and again, however, I feel a curiosity about those topics. But\n(now), O Madhava! you will be going at no distant date to Dvaraka.\n\nVai _s_ ampayana said\n\nThus addressed, that best of speakers, K _ri_ sh _n_ a, possessed of great\nglory, replied in these words after embracing Ar _g_ una.\n\nVasudeva said:\n\nFrom me, O son of Pritha! you heard a mystery, and learnt about the eternal 3\n(principle), about piety in (its true) form, and about all the everlasting\nworlds 4. It is excessively disagreeable to me, that you should not have\ngrasped it through want of intelligence. And the recollection (of it) now\nagain is not possible (to me). Really, O son of Pandu! you are devoid of faith\nand of a bad intellect. And, O Dhana\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya! it is not possible for me to\nrepeat in full (what I said before). For that doctrine was perfectly adequate\nfor understanding the seat, 5 of the Brahman. It is not possible for me to\nstate it again in full in that way. For then accompanied by my mystic power 6,\nI declared to you the Supreme Brahman. But I shall relate an ancient story\nupon\n\np. 231\n\nthat subject, so that adhering to this knowledge, you may attain the highest\ngoal. O best of the supporters of piety! listen to all that I say. (Once), O\nrestrainer of foes! there came from the heavenly world and the world of\nBrahman 1, a Brahma _n_ a difficult to withstand 2, and he was (duly) honoured\nby us. (Now) listen, without entertaining any misgivings, O chief of the\ndescendants of Bharata! O son of P _ri_ tha! to what he said on being\ninterrogated by us according to heavenly rules 3.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said:\n\nO K _ri_ sh _n_ a! O destroyer of Madhu! I will explain to you accurately what\nyou, out of compassion for (all) beings 4, have asked me touching the duties\n(to be Performed) for final emancipation. It is destructive of delusion, O\nLord! Listen to me with attention 5, as I relate it, O Madhava! A certain\nBrahma _n_ a named Ka _s_ yapa, who had performed (much) penance, and who best\nunderstood piety, approached a certain twice-born. (person) who had learnt the\nScriptures relating to (all) duties 6, having heard (of him, as one) who had\nover and over again gone through all knowledge and experience about coming and\ngoing 7, who was well versed in the true nature of all worlds 8,\n\np. 232\n\nwho knew about happiness and misery 1, who knew the truth about birth and\ndeath 2, who was conversant with merit and sin, who perceived the migrations\nof embodied (souls) of high and low (degrees) in consequence of (their)\nactions, who moved about like an emancipated being, who had reached perfection\n3, who was tranquil, whose senses were restrained, who was illumined with the\nBrahmic splendour 4, who moved about in every direction, who understood\nconcealed movements 5, who was going in company of invisible Siddhas and\ncelestial singers 6, and conversing and sitting together (with them) in\nsecluded (places), who went about as he pleased, and was unattached (anywhere)\nlike the wind. Having approached him, that talented ascetic possessed of\nconcentration (of mind), that best of the twice-born, wishing to acquire\npiety, fell at his feet, after seeing that great marvel. And amazed on seeing\nthat marvellous man, the best of the twice-born, Ka _s_ yapa, pleased the\npreceptor by his great devotion. That was all appropriate 7, (being) joined to\nsacred learning and correct conduct. And, O terror of your foes! he pleased\nthat (being) by (his purity of) heart and behaviour (suitable) towards a\npreceptor 8. Then being satisfied and pleased, he spoke to the pupil these\nwords, referring to the\n\np. 233\n\nhighest perfection: Hear (them) from me, O _G_ anardana!\n\nThe Siddha said:\n\nMortals, O dear friend 1! by their actions which are (of) mixed (character),\nor which are meritorious and pure, attain to this world as the goal, or to\nresidence in the world of the gods 2. Nowhere is there everlasting happiness;\nnowhere eternal residence 3. Over and over again is there a downfall from a\nhigh position attained with difficulty. Overcome by lust and anger, and\ndeluded by desire, I fell into uncomfortable and harassing states (of life),\nin-consequence of (my) committing sin. Again and again death, and again and\nagain birth 4. I ate numerous (kinds of) food, sucked at various breasts, saw\nvarious mothers, and fathers of different sorts; and, O sinless one! (I saw)\nstrange pleasures and miseries. Frequently (I suffered) separation from those\nI loved, association with those I did not love. Loss of wealth also came on\nme, after I had acquired that wealth with difficulty; ignominies full of\naffliction from princes and likewise from kinsmen; excessively poignant pain,\nmental and bodily. I also underwent frightful indignities, and fierce deaths\nand captivities; (I had a) fall into hell, and torments in the house of Yama\n5. I also suffered much from old age, continual ailments, and numerous\nmisfortunes flowing from the pairs of opposites 6. Then on one occasion, being\nmuch afflicted with misery, I abandoned the whole\n\np. 234\n\ncourse of worldly life, through indifference (to worldly objects), al, taking\nrefuge with the formless (principle) 1. Having learnt about this path in this\nworld, I exercised myself (in it), and hence, through favour of the self 2,\nhave I acquired this perfection 3. I shall not come here again 4; I am\nsurveying the worlds, and the happy migrations 5 of (my) self from the\ncreation of beings to (my attaining) perfection. Thus, O best of the twice-\nborn! have I obtained this highest perfection. From here I go to the next 6\n(world), and from there again to the still higher (world)--the imperceptible\nseat of the Brahman. Have no doubt on that, O terror of your foes 7! I shall\nnot come back to this mortal world. I am pleased with you, O you of great\nintelligence! Say, what can I do for you? The time is now come for that which\nyou desired in coming to me. I know for what you have come to me. But I shall\nbe going away in a short time, hence have I given\n\np. 235\n\nthis hint to you. I am exceedingly pleased, O clever one! with your good\nconduct. Put (your) questions without uneasiness, I will tell (you) whatever\nyou desire. I highly esteem your intelligence, and greatly respect it,\ninasmuch as you have made me out [1](sbe0829.htm#fn_1066); for, O Ka _s_ yapa!\nyou are (a) talented (man).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[229:1](sbe0828.htm#fr_1032) This is the prince to whom the Mahabharata, as we\nhave it, purports to have been related.\n\n[229:2](sbe0828.htm#fr_1033) I. e. Vai _s_ ampayana, who relates the\nMahabharata to _G_ aname _g_ aya.\n\n[229:3](sbe0828.htm#fr_1034) This appears to have been situated at\nIndraprastha, and to have been the one built for the Pa _nd_ avas by the demon\nMaya, as related in the Sabha Parvan.\n\n[229:4](sbe0828.htm#fr_1035) This is a rather unusual form of address.\n\n[230:1](sbe0828.htm#fr_1036) Cf. Bhagavadgita, chapters X and XI passim.\n\n[230:2](sbe0828.htm#fr_1037) I. e. in the Bhagavadgita.\n\n[230:3](sbe0828.htm#fr_1038) This may also be taken with piety thus: 'and\nlearnt about the eternal piety in (its true) form.'\n\n[230:4](sbe0828.htm#fr_1039) As to the plural, see _S_ a _n_ kara on Mu _nd_\naka, p. 320.\n\n[230:5](sbe0828.htm#fr_1040) Cf. Gita, [p. 78](sbe0810.htm#page_78). For\n'understanding' here we might, perhaps, substitute 'attaining.' The original\nword means both understanding and attaining.\n\n[230:6](sbe0828.htm#fr_1041) Cf. Gita, [p. 182](sbe0825.htm#page_182).\n\n[231:1](sbe0828.htm#fr_1042) This seems to mean not the Supreme Brahman, but\nthe Creator.\n\n[231:2](sbe0828.htm#fr_1043) Cf. Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p.\n161](sbe0823.htm#page_161), 'not to be shaken.'\n\n[231:3](sbe0828.htm#fr_1044) I suppose this to mean according to the forms\nproper in the case of such a being as the one in question. Cf. Gita, [p.\n62](sbe0806.htm#page_62), and note there.\n\n[231:4](sbe0828.htm#fr_1045) This is not easy to understand. Perhaps the\nallusion is to the doctrine at Gita, pp. [54](sbe0805.htm#page_54),\n[55](sbe0805.htm#page_55).\n\n[231:5](sbe0828.htm#fr_1046) Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 447.\n\n[231:6](sbe0828.htm#fr_1047) I. e. all prescribed acts of piety.\n\n[231:7](sbe0828.htm#fr_1048) As to knowledge and experience, cf. Gita, [p.\n57](sbe0805.htm#page_57); and as to coming and going, cf. ibid. [p.\n84](sbe0811.htm#page_84).\n\n[231:8](sbe0828.htm#fr_1049) I. e. as stated, for instance, at Gita, [p.\n79](sbe0810.htm#page_79), B _ri_ hadara _ny_ aka, p. 613.\n\n[232:1](sbe0828.htm#fr_1050) Cf. infra, [p. 245](sbe0830.htm#page_245).\n\n[232:2](sbe0828.htm#fr_1051) Cf. Gita, pp. [48](sbe0804.htm#page_48),\n[103](sbe0815.htm#page_103).\n\n[232:3](sbe0828.htm#fr_1052) Cf. Gita, passim.\n\n[232:4](sbe0828.htm#fr_1053) Cf. Sanatsugatiya, [p.\n162](sbe0823.htm#page_162).\n\n[232:5](sbe0828.htm#fr_1054) I. e. moving about so as not to be seen by\neverybody.\n\n[232:6](sbe0828.htm#fr_1055) Literally, 'holders of wheels,' which Ar _g_ una\nMi _s_ ra interprets to mean ' _K_ ara _n_ as.' At _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha\nDharma) CCXLIV, 26 Nilaka _nth_ a renders _K_ akradhara by _K_ akravartin or\nEmperor.\n\n[232:7](sbe0828.htm#fr_1056) I. e. as Ka _s_ yapa was possessed of Vedic lore,\nand behaved as he ought to behave in his capacity of pupil, it was natural\nthat the other should be pleased.\n\n[232:8](sbe0828.htm#fr_1057) See [p. 176](sbe0825.htm#page_176) seq. supra.\n\n[233:1](sbe0828.htm#fr_1058) The same word as at Gita, [p.\n72](sbe0808.htm#page_72).\n\n[233:2](sbe0828.htm#fr_1059) Cf. _Kh_ andogya-upanishad, pp. 356-359, and\nGita, [p. 84](sbe0811.htm#page_84).\n\n[233:3](sbe0828.htm#fr_1060) See Gita, [p. 76](sbe0809.htm#page_76), and cf.\nKa _th_ a, p. 90.\n\n[233:4](sbe0828.htm#fr_1061) For the whole of this passage, c.f.; Maitri-\nupanishad, p. 8.\n\n[233:5](sbe0828.htm#fr_1062) See Manu VI, 61.\n\n[233:6](sbe0828.htm#fr_1063) See Gita, [p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48).\n\n[234:1](sbe0828.htm#fr_1064) Taking refuge, says Nilaka _nth_ a, in the belief\nof my being identical with the Brahman, which is to be comprehended by means\nof the profound contemplation called Asampra _g_ \xc3\xb1ata Samadhi.\n\n[234:2](sbe0828.htm#fr_1065) I. e., says Nilakan _th_ a, the mind, and he\ncites Maitri, p. 179. Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 108. The rendering at [p.\n192](sbe0826.htm#page_192) supra will also suit (through the self becoming\nplacid). This placidity is defined at _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha Dharma) CCXLVII,\n11, with which cf. Gita, [p. 69](sbe0808.htm#page_69). See Gita, [p.\n51](sbe0804.htm#page_51).\n\n[234:3](sbe0828.htm#fr_1066) As above described.\n\n[234:4](sbe0828.htm#fr_1067) Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 628; see also ibid. p. 282.\n\n[234:5](sbe0828.htm#fr_1068) He calls them happy because they have ended\nhappily, I presume. 'Surveying the worlds' Nilaka _nth_ a takes to be an index\nof omniscience. Cf. Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p. 174](sbe0824.htm#page_174). See\nalso Yoga-sutras III, 25, and commentary there.\n\n[234:6](sbe0828.htm#fr_1069) I. e. the world of Brahman, or the Satyaloka; and\nthe next step is assimilation into the Brahman.\n\n[234:7](sbe0828.htm#fr_1070) So read all the copies I have seen, though Ka _s_\nyapa is the person addressed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II](sbe0829.htm)\n\n"
