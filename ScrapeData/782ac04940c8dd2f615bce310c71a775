The released one; on account of the promise.\n\nWhat the text says about the soul accomplishing itself in its own form refers\nto the released soul which, freed from its connexion with works and what\ndepends thereon, i.e. the body and the rest, abides in its true essential\nnature.--That essential nature no doubt is something eternally accomplished,\nbut as in the Sa _m_ sara state it is obscured by Nescience in the form of\nKarman; the text refers to the\n\np. 757\n\ncessation of such obscuration as 'accomplishment.'--How is this known?--'From\nthe promise,'i.e. from the fact that the text promises to set forth such\ncessation. For Pra _g_ apati when saying again and again, 'I will explain that\nfurther to you,' does so with a view to throw light on the individual soul--\nfirst introduced in the clause 'that Self which is free from sin, &c.' (VIII,\n7, 1)--in so far as freed from all connexion with the three empirical\nconditions of waking, dreaming and dreamless sleep, and released from the body\nwhich is due to Karman and the cause of joy and sorrow. When, therefore, he\nconcludes 'that serene being, i.e. the soul, having risen from this body and\nhaving approached the highest light accomplishes itself in its true form,'we\nunderstand that such 'accomplishment' means the final release, i.e. the\ncessation of all bondage, which is gained by the soul, previously connected\nwith Karman, as soon as it approaches the highest light.--The Purvapakshin had\nsaid that as in the state of deep sleep the manifestation of the true nature\nof the soul is seen in no way to benefit man, Scripture, if declaring that\nRelease consists in a manifestation of the true nature of the soul, would\nclearly teach something likewise not beneficial to man; and that hence the\n'accomplishment in its own form' must mean the soul's entering on such a new\ncondition of existence as would be a cause of pleasure, viz. the condition of\na deva or the like. To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 3. The Self, on account of subject-matter](sbe48554.htm)\n\n"
