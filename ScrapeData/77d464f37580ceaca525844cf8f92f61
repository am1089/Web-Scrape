He conquered and brought under subjection his eleven organs of\naction and perception: he endured hunger, thirst and all changes of season. In\nthis manner he began to perform penance, keeping in remembrance the feet of\nMuhadeo: he constantly rose up and eat a handful of sand; and performed\ndifficult penance, fixing his thoughts upon Shivu. One year passed away thus,\nthen Muhadeo granted him a boon. "From today, thou shalt not be subject to the\ninfirmities of age, and shalt not die; and the demon Mye shall make for you a\nruth of delusive power, which shall carry you wherever you wish: it shall have\npower, through the efficacy of my blessing, to go every where like a chariot\nin the three worlds."\n\nO great king! as Sudashivu Jee granted this boon, a ruth came and stood before\nSalub; who, having made a salutation\n\np. 383\n\nto Shivu Jee and mounted upon the ruth, proceeded with tumultuous haste to the\ncity of Dwarka. Having gone there, he began to occasion all sorts of troubles\nto the inhabitants of the city: sometimes he used to pour down fire upon them,\nsometimes water: he sometimes uprooted trees, and threw them upon the city,\nand sometimes hills; from dread of him, all the inhabitants running off in\ngreat alarm, went to Raja Oogursen, and called out to him for mercy and\nprotection. "O great king! a demon has come into the city, and caused the\ngreatest confusion; and if he continue to commit the same acts of violence he\nhas already committed, not a soul will be left alive."\n\nO great king! on hearing these words, Raja Oogursen sent for Purdiyomun Jee\nand Sumboo, and said, "Behold! this demon has come to watch Huri, and to vex\nthe inhabitants; form some plan for remedying the distresses he has caused."\nOn receiving the Raja\'s orders, Purdiyomun Jee took all his army; and, having\ngone in a chariot outside the city, was ready for battle. Seeing, that Sumboo\nwas terrified, he said, Be not at all anxious; I will, by the glorious favour\nof Huri, destroy this demon in a second." Having thus spoken, when Purdiyomun\nJee taking his army with him, and seizing his weapons, came opposite to the\ndemon; the demon exercised his delusive power in such a manner, that the day\nwas changed into a very dark night. Purdiyomun, upon this, discharged arrows\nof fire, and dissipated the thick darkness, just as the rays of the sun would\ndisperse a fog. After this he discharged several arrows with such force, that\nthe demon\'s ruth was sent helter skelter; and he, being frightened, sometimes\nran off; and sometimes returning, fought, exercising delusive power in various\ndemoniacal ways; and gave great annoyance to the subjects of Purdiyomun.\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O great king! there was a great battle raging on both sides; in\nthe midst of which, Doobid, the minister of Salub, came all at once, and\nstruck\n\np. 384\n\n[paragraph continues] Purdiyomun with such violence on the chest with a club,\nthat he fell senseless. On his falling, Doobid screamed out, "I have killed\nShree Krishnu\'s son, Purdiyomun."\n\nO great king! while the descendants of Judoo were carrying on a mighty contest\nwith the demons, the son of the charioteer, Daruk; seeing that Purdiyomun Jee\nhad fainted, threw him into a chariot, and ran off with him from the field of\nbattle, and brought him into the city. On recovering his senses, Purdiyomun\nJee was greatly enraged, and said to the charioteer, "It was not right in you,\nknowing me to be senseless, to make me run from the field of battle. You left\nthe field, and brought me home: this is not the act of a brave man. There is\nnot in the family of Judoo a single member, who would abandon, and run from\nthe field of battle. What! didst thou ever see me fly, that thou hast to-day\nbrought me away, and made me leave the battle? Whoever hears of this, will\nlaugh at, and reproach me. You have not done well, in fixing a stain upon my\nreputation without necessity."\n\nOn hearing these words, O great king! the charioteer, having descended from\nthe chariot, stood up in the presence of Purdiyomun; and with joined hands,\nand bowing his head, said, "Lord! you know all customs and usages; and there\nis not in the world a right practice, with which you are not acquainted. It is\nsaid, \'When a brave warrior in a chariot falls wounded, his charioteer will\ncarry him off from the field of battle. If the charioteer should be wounded\nand fall; the warrior in the chariot ought to save and take him away.\' You\nreceived a very severe blow from a powerful club, and fainted, and were\nsenseless. I, then, went off with you from the battle. I feared lest my master\nmight be injured, or dishonoured. You have taken about an hour\'s rest: now go,\nand fight again. You know what is right and proper: do not cast a thought upon\nthe laughter and jeering of the world. Destroy all the evil spirits\nimmediately, and seize forcibly upon the delusive power of the demon."\n\np. 385\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, the charioteer took some water to Purdiyomun\nJee; who, having washed his hands and face, and being fully recovered, putting\non a coat of mail and helmet, and taking in his hand his bow and arrows, said\nto the charioteer, "Well! what has happened, has happened; but take me now to\nthe spot, where Doobid has continued to fight with the descendants of Judoo."\nOn hearing this, the charioteer instantly took him to where Doobid was\nfighting. On going there, Purdiyomun called out to him, and said, "Why are you\nfighting here and there, come and confront me, that I may send you to\nSissoopal?" When, on hearing this challenge, Doobid rushed upon Purdiyomun\nJee, Purdiyomun discharged several arrows, which struck, and brought him to\nthe ground: and Sumboo, having also cut into pieces the army of the demons,\nfilled the sea with them.\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! when the descendants of Judoo had been engaged twenty-seven days in\nfighting at Dwarka with the army of the demons, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee,\nacquainted with the secrets of the heart, remaining at Hustinapoor, and\nbeholding the condition of Dwarka, said to Raja Joodisthur, "O great king! I\nbeheld in a dream, during the night, that great violence was being perpetrated\nat Dwarka, and that all the descendants of Judoo were grievously afflicted; I\nwill, therefore, with your permission, take my departure for Dwarka." On\nhearing this Raja Joodisthur, having joined his hands, said, "Do as you\nplease." When the Raja had thus spoken Shree Krishnu and Bulram took leave of\nall; and when they came outside the city, beheld a doe running towards them on\nthe left hand, and a dog standing in front of them shaking his head. When Huri\nhad seen these bad omens, he said to Bulram, "Brother! come after me with all\nthe rest of the party, and I will go on in advance."\n\np. 386\n\nRaja! Shree Krishnu Chund, after thus speaking to his brother, went on to the\nfield of battle, and there saw, that the demons had, in every direction,\ncommitted great slaughter on the descendants of Judoo, who were carrying on\nthe contest in very great confusion, whilst Huri was standing there, and\nreflecting thoughtfully on this state of affairs, Buldeo Jee also arrived; at\nthat time Shree Krishnu said to Bulram, "Brother! go and protect the city and\nthe inhabitants, I will come after I have destroyed these demons." Having\nreceived Krishnu\'s order, Buldeo Jee went into the city, and Huri to the field\nof battle, where Purdiyomun was contending with Salub. The shell was sounded\non the arrival of the lord of the Judoos, when all knew that Shree Krishnu\nChund had come.\n\nO great king! when Krishnu went upon the field of battle, Salub flew off with\nhis chariot to the sky, and began to pour down arrows of fire from thence like\nrain. Then Shree Krishnu Chund Jee counted sixteen arrows, and discharged them\nwith such force, that Salub\'s chariot and driver were utterly destroyed, and\nhe fell reeling down; recovering himself after his fall, Salub\'s struck Huri\non the left arm with an arrow, and called out, "Ho Krishnu! I wish to make\ntrial of your strength, and fight with you; you have by fraud or force killed\nSunkhasoor, Bhomasoor, Sissoopal and other very powerful men: but it will be a\ndifficult matter for you to escape now from my hands; you have now to deal\nwith me, lay aside deceit and begin the contest; the powerful Banasoor and\nBhomasoor are expecting you, Huri, I will send you where you will not be able\nto come back from; if you run away, you will not gain greatness." When\nKrishnu, in reply to this speech, had said, "O stupid, proud, cowardly fool!\nChutrees and firm, resolute, brave men do not begin with talking in a high\nsounding strain to any one;" the demon rushed upon Huri, and aimed a very\n\np. 387\n\nfurious blow with a club at him, which Krishnu easily warded off; then Shree\nKrishnu Chund Jee struck him with a club; and on receiving the blow, he\nremained senseless for two hours under the protection of his delusive power;\nhe afterwards assumed a disguise, and coming into the presence of Krishnu\nsaid, "Your mother, Dewukee, who is in a state of great agitation, has sent me\nhere: your enemy Salub has seized and carried off Basoodeo."\n\nO great king! the demon having thus spoken, went thence; and having made an\nillusory Basoodeo, brought it bound into the presence of Shree Krishnu and\nsaid, "Behold! Krishnu, I have brought your father bound, and I will now cut\noff his head, and destroy all the descendants of Judoo, and fill the sea with\nthem, afterwards I will kill you and hold universal dominion."\n\nO great king! when he had thus spoken, he abased the head of the imaginary\nBasoodeo and cut it off in sight of Shree Krishnu Jee, and having placed it\nupon the point of a spear, showed it publicly. On beholding this act of the\ndelusive power, Krishnu at first became faint; but afterwards recovering,\nbegan to say to himself, "How has it happened that he has seized and brought\nBasoodeo Jee from Dwarka, whilst Bulram was there, what! is he more powerful\nthan Bulram, that he should have carried off Basoodeo from before him and\nbrought him here?"\n\nO great king! many thoughts of this kind passed for a long time through the\nmind of Krishnu, whilst he was under the influence of the demon\'s delusive\npower, and he was absorbed in reflection; at length whilst Huri was\nconsidering and looking at the demon\'s illusory apparition, he found out the\nsecret of the contrivance, and called out to Salub. On hearing Krishnu\'s\nchallenge, he mounted into the air, and began to discharge weapons thence upon\nKrishnu; in the mean while Shree Krishnu Chund Jee struck him with several\narrows with such force, that the demon fell with his ruth into the sea;\n\np. 388\n\nrecovering from the fall, he rushed upon Huri with a club; upon which Krishnu\nwas greatly enraged and killed and brought him to the ground with the quoit,\nSoodursun; just as the lord of the gods killed and brought down Britasoor.\n\nO great king! on the fall of the demon, the jewel of his head fell out upon\nthe ground, and the splendour of it was concentrated in the mouth of Shree\nKrishnu Chund.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXVIII](psa79.htm)\n\n'
