Now the hermits in the wood belong to two classes, 1\n\np. 292\n\n2\\. Those who cook (their food), and those who do not cook it.\n\n3\\. Among them, those who cook (their food are divided) into five\nsubdivisions, (viz.) those who eat everything which the forest contains, those\nwho live on unhusked (wild-growing grain), those who eat bulbs and roots,\nthose who eat fruit, and those who eat pot-herbs.\n\n4\\. Those who eat everything which the forest produces are, again, of two\nkinds: they either subsist on forest-produce generated by Indra, or on that\nwhich has been generated from semen.\n\n5\\. Among these, that which has been generated by Indra (is the produce) of\nlianas, shrubs, creepers, and trees. Fetching (that) and cooking it, they\noffer the Agnihotra in the evening and in the morning, give (food) to\nascetics, guests, and students, and eat the remainder.\n\n6\\. That which is generated from semen is the flesh (of animals) slain by\ntigers, wolves, falcons, and other (carnivorous beasts), or by one of them.\nFetching (that) and cooking it, they offer the Agnihotra in the evening and in\nthe morning, give (shares) to ascetics, guests, and students, and eat the\nremainder.\n\n7\\. Those who eat unhusked grain only, fetch rice, avoiding (husked) corn,\nboil it, offer the Agnihotra both in the evening and in the morning, give\n(food) to ascetics, guests, and students, and eat the remainder.\n\n8\\. Those who eat bulbs and roots, or fruit, or pot-herbs, (act) exactly in\nthe same manner.\n\n9\\. Those (hermits) who do not cook (their food are divided into) five\n(classes), Unma _g_ _g_ akas, Prav _ri_ tta _s_ ins,\n\np. 293\n\n[paragraph continues] Mukhenadayins, Toyaharas, and Vayubhakshas.\n\n10\\. Among these, the Unma _g_ _g_ akas (collect and prepare their food),\navoiding (the use of) iron and stone implements,\n\n11\\. The Prav _ri_ tta _s_ ins take it with the hand, 11\n\n12\\. The Mukhenadayins take it with the mouth (only, like beasts),\n\n13\\. The Toyaharas subsist on water only,\n\n14\\. And the Vayubhakshas (air-eaters) eat nothing.\n\n15\\. In this manner ten (different) initiations are prescribed for hermits who\nfollow the rule of Vikhanas (vaikhanasa). 15\n\n16\\. He who has agreed (to obey) the Institutes of his (order, shall wear) a\nstaff, (shall keep) rigid silence, and (shall) abstain from rash acts.\n\n17\\. Hermits following the rule of Vikhanas (vaikhanasa) are purified (from\nsin), and (especially) those who abstain from food.\n\n18\\. The sum of the rules applicable to all Brahma-Vaikhanasas (is as\nfollows): 18\n\n19\\. \'Let him not injure (even) gadflies or gnats; let him bear cold and\nperform austerities; let him constantly reside in the forest, be contented,\nand\n\np. 294\n\ndelight in (dresses made of) bark and skins, (and in carrying) water (in his\npot).\'\n\n20\\. \'A devotee shall first honour the guests who have come to his hermitage\nat (dinner) time; he shall be sedulous in (worshipping) gods and Brahma _n_\nas, in (offering) the Agnihotra, and in practising austerities.\'\n\n21\\. "A Brahma _n_ a who has taken to forest-life, and who has adopted this\ndifficult (but) pure mode of existence, which keeps him apart from wicked men,\nwhich must never be given up, which is similar to (that of the) beasts and\nbirds, which allows the collection of the necessaries of life for one day\nonly, and which necessitates the consumption of astringent and bitter (food),\nnever sinks low.\'\n\n22\\. \'Moving about with the beasts, dwelling together with them, and\nmaintaining oneself in a manner similar to theirs, that is clearly the road to\nheaven.\' 22\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[291:1](sbe1475.htm#fr_1349) **3**.

These three Sutras are omitted in the\ncommentary, but found in all the MSS. of the text.\n\n[293:18](sbe1475.htm#fr_1352) Govinda proposes two explanations for the term\nbrahmavaikhanasa; he thinks that it may mean either brahma _n_ a d _ri_ sh _t_\na vaikhanasa _h_ , \'hermits seen by Brahman,\' i.e. whose duties have been\nrevealed by Brahman, or \'hermits who are Brahma _n_ as by caste.\' The true\nsense, however, is probably \'a hermit (who strives) to (become one with)\nBrahman\' (brahmartha _m_ valikhanasa).\n\n[294:22](sbe1475.htm#fr_1353) See above, III, 2, 19.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na III, Adhyaya 4](sbe1476.htm)\n\n'
