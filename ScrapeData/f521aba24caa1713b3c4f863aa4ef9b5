Shree Krishnu went one day early to the\njungle to feed the calves; and all the cowherds\' children, taking provisions\nwith them from their homes, accompanied him. Having gone to the pasture\nground, and deposited their food, and let the calves loose to graze, staining\ntheir bodies with white and red earth, making necklaces of jungle fruits and\nflowers, they put them on, and imitating the sounds of beasts and birds, and\nindulging in sports of various kinds, they began to dance and sing.\n\nIn the meantime, a demon named Ooghasoor, sent by Kuns, arrived; and being\ntransformed into a. huge serpent, sat with his-mouth open; and Shree Krishnu\nplaying, sporting and taking his companions with him, came to the spot where\nthe serpent, having prepared his ambuscade, was sitting with his mouth open.\nHaving beheld him from a distance, the cowherds\' children began to say amongst\nthemselves, "Brother! this is some great mountain, the chasm of which is so\nlarge." Thus conversing, and leading the calves, they came near the serpent.\nOne child then seeing its mouth open, said, "Brother! this is some very\nfrighful cave, do not let us go inside it, we are frightened on even looking\nat it." One of the companions, named Tokh, then said, "Come, let us go inside,\nwhat fear have\n\np. 52\n\nwe, whilst Krishnu is with us? If it should be any demon, he will be destroyed\nas Bukasoor was." They were all standing and conversing thus, when the serpent\ndrew such a deep breath, that all the cowherds\' children together with the\ncalves fell into his mouth. There was such a poisonous, hot vapour, that the\ncalves alarmed, began to low, and Krishnu\'s companions to call out, "O beloved\nKrishnu! quickly take thought of us, or we shall be burnt to death." Hearing\ntheir cries, Shree Krishnu, being distressed, went also into his mouth; and\nthe serpent delighted shut its mouth. Upon this, Shree Krishnu increased his\nbody to such a size, that the serpent\'s stomach was burst. All the calves and\ncowherds\' children fell out. At this time, the gods delighted, and raining\nflowers and nectar, took away the heat, under which all were suffering. Upon\nthis, the cowherds\' children began to say to Shree Krishnu, "Brother! by\nputting this demon to death, you have well saved us: otherwise, all would have\nperished--(or had perished,)"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIV](psa15.htm)\n\n'
