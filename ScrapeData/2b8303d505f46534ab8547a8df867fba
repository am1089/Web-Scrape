XV.\n\nWhat Brahmans are to be entertained at \xc5\x9araddhas. Different prayers to be\nrecited. Offerings of food to be presented to deceased ancestors.\n\nAURVA proceeded.--"Hear next, oh prince, what description of Brahman should be\nfed at ancestral ceremonies. he should be one studied in various triplets of\nthe Rich and Yajur Vedas 1; one who is acquainted with the six supplementary\nsciences of the Vedas 2; one who understands the Vedas; one who practises the\nduties they enjoin 3; one who exercises penance; a chanter of the principal\nSama-veda 4, an officiating priest, a sister\'s son, a daughter\'s son, a son-\nin-law, a father-in-law, a maternal uncle, an ascetic, a Brahman who maintains\nthe five fires, a pupil, a kinsman; one who reverences his parents. A man\nshould first employ the Brahmans first specified in the principal obsequial\n\np. 326\n\nrite; and the others (commencing with the ministering priest) in the\nsubsidiary ceremonies instituted to gratify his ancestors.\n\n"A false friend, a man with ugly nails or black teeth, a ravisher, a Brahman\nwho neglects the service of fire and sacred study, a vender of the Soma plant,\na man accused of any crime, a thief, a calumniator, a Brahman who conducts\nreligious ceremonies for the vulgar; one who instructs his servant in holy\nwrit, or is instructed in it by his servant; the husband of a woman who has\nbeen formerly betrothed to another; a man who is undutiful to his parents; the\nprotector of the husband of a woman of the servile caste, or the husband of a\nwoman of the servile caste; and a Brahman who ministers to idols--are not\nproper persons to be invited to au ancestral offering 5. On the first day let\na judicious man invite eminent teachers of the Vedas, and other Brahmans; and\naccording to their directions determine what is to be dedicated to the gods,\nand what to the Pitris. Associated with the Brahmans, let the institutor of an\nobsequial rite abstain from anger and incontinence. He who having eaten\nhimself in a \xc5\x9araddha, and fed Brahmans, and appointed them to their sacred\noffices, is guilty of incontinence, thereby sentences his progenitors to\nshameful suffering. In the first place, the Brahmans before described are to\nbe invited; but those holy men who come to the house without an invitation are\nalso to be entertained. The guests are to be reverently received with water\nfor their feet, and the like; and the entertainer, holding holy grass in his\nhand, is to place them, after they have rinsed their mouths, upon seats. An\nuneven number of Brahmans is to be invited in sacrifices to the manes; an even\nor uneven number in those presented to the gods; or one only on each occasion\n6.\n\n"Then let the householder, inspired by religious faith, offer oblations to the\nmaternal grandfather, along with the worship of the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas 7,\n\np. 327\n\nor the ceremony called Vai\xc5\x9bwadeva, which comprehends offerings to both\npaternal and maternal ancestors, and to ancestors in general. Let him feed the\nBrahmans who are appropriated to the gods, and to maternal ancestors, with\ntheir faces to the north; and those set apart for the paternal ancestors, and\nancestors in general, with their faces to the east. Some say that the viands\nof the \xc5\x9araddha should be kept distinct for these two sets of ancestors, but\nothers maintain that they are to be fed with the same food, at the same time.\nHaving spread Ku\xc5\x9ba grass for seats, and offered libations according to rule,\nlet the sensible man invoke the deities, with the concurrence of the Brahmans\nwho are present 8. Let the man who is acquainted with the ritual offer a\nlibation to the gods with water and barley, having presented to them flowers,\nperfumes, and incense. Let him offer the same to the Pitris, placed upon his\nleft; and with the consent of the Brahmans, having first provided seats of\nKu\xc5\x9ba grass doubled, let him invoke with the usual prayers the manes to the\nceremony, offering a libation, on his left hand, of water and sesamum. He will\nthen, with the permission of the Brahmans, give food to any guest who arrives\nat the time, or who is desirous of victuals, or who is passing along the road;\nfor holy saints\n\np. 328\n\nand ascetics, benefactors of mankind, are traversing this earth, disguised in\nvarious shapes 9. On this account let a prudent man welcome a person who\narrives at such a season; for inattention to a guest frustrates the\nconsequences of an ancestral offering.\n\n"The sacrificer is then to offer food, without salt or seasoning, to fire 10,\nthree several times, with the consent of the assistant Brahmans; exclaiming\nfirst, \'To fire, the vehicle of the oblations; to the manes Swaha!\' Next\naddressing the oblation to Soma, the lord of the progenitors; and giving the\nthird to Vaivaswata. He is then to place a very little of the residue of the\noblation in the dishes of the Brahmans; and next, presenting them with choice\nviands, well dressed and seasoned, and abundant, he is to request them civilly\nto partake of it at their pleasure. The Brahmans are to eat of such food\nattentively, in silence, with cheerful countenances, and at their ease. The\nsacrificer is to give it to them, not churlishly, nor hurriedly, but with\ndevout faith.\n\n"Having next recited the prayer for the discomfiture of malignant spirits 11,\nand scattered sesamum-seeds upon the ground, the Brahmans who have been fed\nare to be addressed, in common with the ancestors of the sacrificer, in this\nmanner: \'May my father, grandfather, and great grandfather, in the persons of\nthese Brahmans, receive satisfaction! May my father, grandfather, and great\ngrandfather derive nutriment from these oblations to fire! May my father,\ngrandfather, and great grandfather derive satisfaction from the balls of food\nplaced by me upon the ground! May my father, grandfather, and great\ngrandfather be pleased with what I have this day offered them in faith! May my\nmaternal grandfather, his father, and his father, also enjoy contentment from\nmy offerings! May all the gods experience gratification, and all evil beings\nperish! May the lord of sacrifice, the imperishable deity\n\np. 329\n\n[paragraph continues] Hari, be the acceptor of all oblations made to the manes\nor the gods! and may all malignant spirits, and enemies of the deities, depart\nfrom the rite.\'\n\n"When the Brahmans have eaten sufficiently, the worshipper must scatter some\nof the food upon the ground, and present them individually with water to rinse\ntheir mouths; then, with their assent, he may place upon the ground balls made\nup of boiled rice and condiments, along with sesamum-seeds. With the part of\nhis hand sacred to the manes he must offer sesamum-seeds, and water from his\njoined palms; and with the same part of his hand he must present cakes to his\nmaternal ancestors. He should in lonely places, naturally beautiful, and by\nthe side of sacred streams, diligently make presents (to the manes and the\nBrahmans) 12. Upon Ku\xc5\x9ba grass, the tips of which are pointed to the south, and\nlying near the fragments of the meat, let the householder present the first\nball of food, consecrated with flowers and incense, to his father; the second\nto his grandfather; and the third to his great grandfather; and let him\nsatisfy those who are contented with the wipings of his hand, by wiping it\nwith the roots of Ku\xc5\x9ba grass 13. After presenting balls of food to his\nmaternal ancestors in the same manner, accompanied by perfumes and incense, he\nis to give to the principal Brahmans water to rinse their mouths; and then,\nwith attention and piety, he is to give the Brahmans gifts, according to his\npower, soliciting their benedictions, accompanied with the exclamation \'Swadha\n14!\' Having made presents to the Brahmans, he is to address himself to the\ngods, saying, \'May they who are the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas be pleased with this oblation!\'\nHaving thus said, and the blessings to be solicited having been granted by the\nBrahmans, he is to dismiss first the paternal ancestors, and then the gods.\nThe order is the same with the maternal ancestors and the gods in respect to\nfood, donation, and dismissal. Commencing with the\n\np. 330\n\nwashing of the feet, until the dismissing of the gods and Brahmans, the\nceremonies are to be performed first for paternal ancestors, and then for\nancestors on the mother\'s side. Let him dismiss the Brahmans with kindly\nspeeches and profound respect, and attend upon them at the end of the \xc5\x9araddha;\nuntil permitted by them to return. The wise man will then perform the\ninvariable worship of the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas, and take\' his own meal along with his\nfriends, his kinsmen, and his dependants.\n\n"In this manner an enlightened householder will celebrate the obsequial\nworship of his paternal and maternal ancestors, who, satisfied by his\nofferings, will grant him all his desires. Three things are held pure at\nobsequies, a daughter\'s son, a Nepal blanket, and sesamum-seeds 15; and the\ngift, or naming, or sight of silver is also propitious 16. The person offering\na \xc5\x9araddha should avoid anger, walking about, and hurry; these three things are\nvery objectionable. The Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas, and paternal and maternal ancestors, and\nthe living members of a man\'s family are all nourished by the offerer of\nancestral oblations.\n\np. 331\n\n"The class of Pitris derives support from the moon, and the moon is sustained\nby acts of austere devotion. Hence the appointment of one who practises\nausterities is most desirable. A Yogi set before a thousand Brahmans enables\nthe institutor of obsequial rites to enjoy all his desires 17."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[325:1](vp089.htm#fr_880) The Brahmans here particularized are termed\nTrin\xcc\x81achiketa, Trimadhu, and Trisuparn\xcc\x81a; and are so denominated, according to\nthe commentator, from particular parts of the Vedas. The first is so called\nfrom studying or reciting three Anuvakas of the Kat\xcc\x81haka branch of the Yajur-\nveda, commencing with the term Trin\xcc\x81achiketa; the second, from three Anuvakas\nof the same Veda, beginning Madhuvata, &c.; and the third, from a similar\nportion, commencing Brahmavan namami. The first and third terms occur in Manu,\nIII. 185; and Kulluka Bhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a explains Trin\xcc\x81achiketa to mean a portion of the\nYajur-veda, and the Brahman who studies it; and Trisuparn\xcc\x81a, a part of the\nRich, and the Brahman who is acquainted with it. The Nirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu explains\nthe terms m a like manner, but calls the Trisuparn\xcc\x81a, as well as the\nTrin\xcc\x81achiketa prayers, portions of the Yajush. The Trimadhu it assigns to the\nRich. Other explanations are also given to the terms Trin\xcc\x81achiketa and\nTrisuparn\xcc\x81a: the first being explained a Brahman who thrice performs the\nceremony called Chayana; and the last, one who, after the seven ascending\ngenerations, worships the Pitris termed Somapas. These explanations are\nhowever considered less correct than the preceding, and which are thus given\nin the authority cited: ###.\n\n[325:2](vp089.htm#fr_881) For the six Angas, see [p. 284](vp080.htm#page_284).\n\n[325:3](vp089.htm#fr_882) So the commentator distinguishes the Vedavit, the\nBrahman who understands the meaning of the text of the Vedas, from the\n\xc5\x9arotriya, who practises the rites he studies.\n\n[325:4](vp089.htm#fr_883) Portions of the Saman contained in the \xc3\x81ran\xcc\x81yaka are\ncalled the Jyesht\xcc\x81ha, \'elder\' or \'principal\' Saman.\n\n[326:5](vp089.htm#fr_884) Manu, III. 150, &c.\n\n[326:6](vp089.htm#fr_885) As two or five at a ceremony dedicated to the gods;\nthree at the worship of the Pitris. Nirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu, p. 311.\n\n[326:7](vp089.htm#fr_886) The worship of the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas (see [p.\n321](vp088.htm#page_321)) forms a part of the general \xc5\x9araddhas, and of the\ndaily sacrifices of the householder. According to the Vayu this was a\nprivilege conferred upon them by Brahma and the Pitris, as a reward for\nreligious austerities practised by them upon Himalaya. Their introduction as a\np. 327 specific class seems to have originated in the custom of sacrificing to\nthe gods collectively, or to all the gods, as the name Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas implies.\nThey appear, however, as a distinct class in the Vedas, and their assumption\nof this character is therefore of ancient date. The daily offering to them is\nnoticed by Manu, III. 90, 172; and offerings to \'the gods\' are also enjoined\nat the beginning and end of a \xc5\x9araddha. Kulluka Bhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a understands here the\nVi\xc5\x9bwadevas, and it probably is so; but in another verse different divinities\nare specified: "First having satisfied Agni, Soma, Yama, with clarified\nbutter, let him proceed to satisfy the manes of his progenitors." v. 211. Manu\nalso directs them to be worshipped first and last in order. See As. Res. VII.\n265, 271, &c.\n\n[327:8](vp089.htm#fr_887) The text is \'with _their_ assent;\' but no noun\noccurs in the sentence with which the relative is connected. It must mean the\nBrahmans, however, as in this passage of Vriddha Par tiara; \'Let the\nsacrificer place his left hand on the Brahman\'s right knee, and say, "Shall I\ninvoke the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas?" and being desired to invoke them, let him address them\nwith the two Mantras, "Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas, he is come! Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas, hear him!"\'\n\n[328:9](vp089.htm#fr_888) This notion occurs more than once in the Vayu, in\nnearly the same words.\n\n[328:10](vp089.htm#fr_889) This places the initiatory oblations noticed by\nManu (see note 7) subsequent to the offerings to the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas.\n\n[328:11](vp089.htm#fr_890) The Rakshoghna Mantra: the extinguishing of a lamp,\nlighted to keep off evil spirits, which is accompanied by a Mantra, or prayer.\nAs. Res. VII. 274.\n\n[329:12](vp089.htm#fr_891) Part of this passage is in the words of Manu, III.\n207. It is omitted in the MSS. in the Bengali character.\n\n[329:13](vp089.htm#fr_892) Manu, III. 296.\n\n[329:14](vp089.htm#fr_893) "Then let the Brahmans address him, saying,\n\'Swadha!\' for in all ceremonies relating to deceased ancestors, the word\nSwadha is the highest benison." Manu, III. 252.\n\n[330:15](vp089.htm#fr_894) We have here the words of Manu; III. 235. Three\nthings are held pure at such obsequies, the daughter\'s son, the Nepal blanket,\nand sesamum-seed.\' Sir Wm. Jones\'s translation of these terms rests upon the\nexplanation of Kulluka Bhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a of this and the verse preceding; \'Let him give\nhis daughter\'s son, though a religious student, food at a \xc5\x9araddha, and the\nblanket for a seat.\' The commentator on our text says that some understand by\nDauhitra, clarified butter made from the milk of a cow fed with grass gathered\non the day of new moon; and some explain it a plate or dish of buffalo horn.\nKutapa he interprets by Asht\xcc\x81ama Muhurtta, the eighth hour of the day, or a\nlittle after noon, although he admits that some render it a blanket made of\ngoats\' wool. These explanations are also noticed in the Nirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu, p.\n302; and, upon the authority of the Matsya P., Kutapa is said to mean eight\nthings; which equally consume (Tapa) all sin (Ku), or noon, a vessel of\nrhinoceros\' horn, a nepal blanket, silver, holy grass, sesamum, kine, and a\ndaughter\'s son.\n\n[330:16](vp089.htm#fr_895) So the Matsya P. has \'the gift, sight, and name of\nsilver are desired.\' The notion originates with Manu, III. 202.\n\n[331:17](vp089.htm#fr_896) The same doctrine is inculcated by the Vayu P.; but\nit appears to be a Pauran\xcc\x81ik innovation, for Manu places the Brahman intent on\nscriptural knowledge and on austere devotion on a level, and makes no mention\nof the Yogi. III, 134.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVI](vp090.htm)\n\n'
