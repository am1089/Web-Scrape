XXXV.\n\n\xc5\x9aamba carries off the daughter of Duryodhana, but is taken prisoner. Balarama\ncomes to Hastinapur, and demands his liberation: it is refused: in his wrath\nhe drags the city towards him, to throw it into the river. The Kuru chiefs\ngive up \xc5\x9aamba and his wife.\n\nMAITREYA.--I have a great desire to hear, excellent Brahman, some further\naccount of the exploits of Balarama. You have related to me his dragging the\nYamuna, and other mighty deeds, but you can tell me, venerable sir, some other\nof his acts.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Attend, Maitreya, to the achievements performed by Rama, who is the\neternal, illimitable \xc5\x9aesha, the upholder of the earth. At the choice of a\nhusband by the daughter of Duryodhana, the princess was carried off by the\nhero \xc5\x9aamba, the son of Jambavati. Being pursued by Duryodhana, Karn\xcc\x81a,\nBhishma, Dron\xcc\x81a, and other celebrated chiefs, who were incensed at his\naudacity, he was defeated, and taken prisoner. When the Yadavas heard of the\noccurrence, their wrath was kindled against Duryodhana and his associates, and\nthey prepared to take up arms against them; but Baladeva, in accents\ninterrupted by the effects of ebriety, forbade them, and said, "I will go\nalone to the sons of Kuru; they will liberate \xc5\x9aamba at my request."\nAccordingly he went to the elephant-styled city (Hastinapur), but took up his\nabode in a grove without the town, which he did not enter. When Duryodhana and\nthe rest heard that he had arrived there, they sent him a cow, a present of\nfruits and flowers, and water. Bala received the offering in the customary\nform, and said to the Kauravas, "Ugrasena commands you to set \xc5\x9aamba at\nliberty." When Duryodhana, Karn\xcc\x81a, Bhishma, Dron\xcc\x81a, and the others, heard\nthis, they were very angry; and Bahlika and other friends of the Kauravas, who\nlooked upon the Yadu race as not entitled to regal dignity, said to the\nwielder of the club, "What is this, Balabhadra, that thou hast uttered? What\nYadava shall give orders to the chiefs of the family of Kuru? If Ugrasena\nissues his mandates to\n\np. 602\n\nthe Kauravas, then we must take away the white umbrella that he has usurped,\nand which is fit only for kings. Depart therefore, Balarama; you are entitled\nto our respect; but \xc5\x9aamba has been guilty of improper conduct, and we will not\nliberate him either at Ugrasena\'s commands or yours. The homage that is due to\nus, their superiors, by the Kukkura and Andhaka tribes, may not be paid by\nthem; but who ever heard of a command issued by a servant to his master?\nElevation to an equal seat has rendered you arrogant. We have committed a\ngreat mistake in neglecting, through our friendship for you, the policy (that\nteaches the danger of treating the abject with deference). Our sending you to-\nday a respectful present was an intimation of (personal) regard, which it was\nneither fit for our race to have proffered, nor for your\'s to have expected."\n\nHaving thus spoken, the Kuru chiefs, unanimously refusing to set the son of\nHari at large, immediately returned into the city. Bala, rolling about with\nintoxication, and the wrath which their contemptuous language had excited,\nstruck the ground furiously with his heel, so that it burst to pieces with a\nloud sound that reverberated through the regions of space. His eyes reddened\nwith rage, and his brow was curved with frowns, as he exclaimed, "What\narrogance is this, in such vile and pithless creatures! The sovereignty of the\nKauravas, as well as our own, is the work of fate, whose decree it also is\nthat they now disrespect or disobey the commands of Ugrasena. Indra may of\nright give his orders to the gods; and Ugrasena exercises equal authority with\nthe lord of \xc5\x9aachi. Fie upon the pride that boasts a throne, the leavings of a\nhundred mortals! Is not he the sovereign of the earth, the wives of whose\nservants adorn themselves with the blossoms of the Parijata tree? Ugrasena\nshall be the undisputed king of kings; for I will not return to his capital\nuntil I have rid the world wholly of the sons of Kuru. I will destroy Karn\xcc\x81a,\nDuryodhana, Dron\xcc\x81a, Bhishma, Bahlika, Duhsa\xc5\x9bana, Bhurisravas, Somadatta,\n\xc5\x9aalya, Bhima, Arjuna, [Yudhisht\xcc\x81hira](errata.htm#26), the twins, and all the\nother vile descendants of Kuru, with their horses, elephants, and chariots. I\nwill rescue the hero \xc5\x9aamba from captivity, and carry him, along with his wife,\nto Dwaraka, where I shall again behold Ugrasena\n\np. 603\n\nand the rest of my kin. Or, authorized by the king of the gods to remove the\nburdens of the earth, I will take this capital of the Kauravas, with all the\nsons of Kuru, and cast the city of the elephant into the Bhagirathi."\n\nSo saying, the wielder of the club, Baladeva, his eyes red with rage, plunged\nthe blade of his ploughshare downwards, beneath the ramparts of the city, and\ndrew them towards him. When the Kauravas beheld Hastinapura tottering, they\nwere much alarmed, and called loudly on Rama, saying, "Rama, Rama! hold, hold!\nsuppress your wrath! have mercy upon us! Here is \xc5\x9aamba, and his wife also,\ndelivered up to thee. Forgive our sins, committed in ignorance of thy wondrous\npower." Accordingly, issuing hurriedly from the city, the Kauravas delivered\n\xc5\x9aamba and his bride to the mighty Balarama, who, bowing to Bhishma, Dron\xcc\x81a,\nand Kripa, who addressed him in conciliatory language, said, "I am satisfied;"\nand so desisted. The city bears the marks of the shock it received, even to\nthe present day--such was the might of Rama--proving both his strength and\nprowess. The Kauravas then offering homage to \xc5\x9aamba and to Bala, dismissed the\nformer with his wife and a bridal portion 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[603:1](vp152.htm#fr_1564) This adventure is related in the Bhagavata, and\nvery briefly noticed in the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba; but I have not found any mention of it\nin the Mahabharata. It may have been suggested originally by Hastinapura\nhaving sustained some injury either from an earthquake or from the\nencroachments of the river, which, as is recorded, compelled the removal of\nthe capital to Kausambi ([p. 461](vp114.htm#page_461)).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXVI](vp153.htm)\n\n'
