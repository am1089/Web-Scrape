With (the formula), 'Stand in your places for the sake of the enjoyment of\nfood. Stand in your places for the sake of long life. Stand in your places for\nthe sake of holy lustre. May I be blessed with long life, an enjoyer of food,\nadorned with holy lustre.'\n\n2\\. Then (the teacher) makes him wash himself with lukewarm water, with the\nthree verses, 'O waters, ye are wholesome' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, I, 5, 1),\nwith the four verses, 'The gold-coloured, clean, purifying (waters)' (Taitt.\nSa _m_ h. V, 6, 1), and with the Anuvaka, 'The purifier, the heavenly one'\n(Taitt. Brahma _n_ a I, 4, 8).\n\n3. 3 Or (instead of performing these rites in the neighbourhood of water) they make an enclosure in a cow-stable and cover it (from all sides); that (the student) enters before sunrise, and in that (enclosure) the whole (ceremony) is performed. 'On that day the sun does not shine upon him,' some say. 'For he who shines (i.e. the sun), shines by the splendour of those who have taken the bath. Therefore the face of a Snataka is, as it were, resplendent (?).'\n\n4. 4 (His friends or relations) bring him all sorts of\n\np. 166\n\nperfumes, or ground sandal wood; he besprinkles that (with water), and\nworships the gods by raising his joined hands towards the east, with (the\nformulas), 'Adoration to Graha (the taker) and to Abhigraha (the seizer)!\nAdoration to _S_ aka and _G_ a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ abha! Adoration to those deities who\nare seizers!' (Then) he anoints himself with (that salve of sandal wood) with\n(the verse), 'The scent that dwells with the Apsaras, and the splendour that\ndwells with the Gandharvas, divine and human scent: may that here enter upon\nme!'\n\n5\\. They bring him a pair of (new) garments that have not yet been washed. He\nbesprinkles them (with water) and puts on the under garment with (the\nformula), 'Thou art Soma's body; protect my body! Thou who art my own body,\nenter upon me; thou who art a blissful body, enter upon me.' Then he touches\nwater, (puts on) the upper garment with the same (Mantra), and sits down to\nthe west of the fire, facing the east.\n\n6. 6 They bring him two ear-rings and a perforated pellet of sandal wood or of Badari wood, overlaid with gold (at its aperture); these two things he ties to a Darbha blade, holds them over the fire, and pours over them (into the fire) oblations (of ghee) with (the Mantras),\n\n'May this gold which brings long life and splendour and increase of wealth,\nand which gets through (all adversities), enter upon me for the sake of long\nlife, of splendour, and of victory. Svaha!\n\np. 167\n\n[paragraph continues] '(This gold) brings high gain, superiority in battles,\nsuperiority in assemblies; it conquers treasures. All perfections unitedly\ndwell together in this gold. Svaha!\n\n'I have obtained an auspicious name like (the name) of a father of gold. Thus\nmay (the gold) make me shine with golden lustre; (may it make me) beloved\namong many people; may it make me full of holy lustre. Svaha!\n\n'Make me beloved among the gods; make me beloved with Brahman (i.e. among the\nBrahma _n_ as), beloved among Vai _s_ yas and _S_ udras; make me beloved among\nthe kings (i.e. among the Kshatriyas). Svaha!\n\n'This herb is protecting, overcoming, and powerful. May it make me shine with\ngolden lustre; (may it make me) beloved among many people; may it make me full\nof holy lustre.
