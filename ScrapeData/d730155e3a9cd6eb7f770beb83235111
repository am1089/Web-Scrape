Bliss and other (qualities) as belonging to the subject of the qualities\n(have to be attributed to Brahman everywhere).\n\nThose scriptural texts which aim at intimating the characteristics of Brahman\nseparately ascribe to it various qualities, such as having bliss for its\nnature, being one mass of knowledge, being omnipresent, being the Self of all\nand so on. Now the doubt here presents itself whether in each place where\nBrahman is spoken of we have to understand only those qualities which actually\nare mentioned there, or whether we have to combine all qualities of Brahman\nmentioned anywhere.\n\np. 202\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that only the attributes actually stated are to be\nunderstood as referred to in each particular scriptural text.--But this view\nthe Sutrakara discards by declaring that delight and all the other qualities\nwhich belong to the subject, i.e. Brahman, are all of them to be understood in\neach place. The reason for this conclusion is the one given in Sutra 10. In\nall the passages treating of Brahman the subject to which the qualities belong\nis one, non-different; hence, as explained at length under the preceding\nSutra, the qualities attributed to Brahman in any one place have to be\ncombined wherever Brahman is spoken of.\n\nBut in that case also such qualities as having joy for its head. &c., would\nhave to be ascribed to Brahman everywhere; for we read in the Taittiriyaka\nwith reference to the Self consisting of Bliss, 'Joy is its head, satisfaction\nis its right arm, great satisfaction its left arm, bliss is its trunk, Brahman\nis its tail, its support' (II, 5).\n\nTo this objection the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 12](sbe38155.htm)\n\n"
